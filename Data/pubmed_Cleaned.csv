      Acute acidaemia is frequently observed during critical illness. Sodium bicarbonate infusion for the treatment of severe metabolic acidaemia is a possible treatment option but remains controversial, as no studies to date have examined its effect on clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether sodium bicarbonate infusion would improve these outcomes in critically ill patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial. Local investigators screened eligible patients from 26 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. We included adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who were admitted within 48 h to the ICU with severe acidaemia (pH ≤7·20, PaCO2 ≤45 mm Hg, and sodium bicarbonate concentration ≤20 mmol/L) and with a total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 or more or an arterial lactate concentration of 2 mmol/L or more. We randomly assigned patients (1:1), by stratified randomisation with minimisation via a restricted web platform, to receive either no sodium bicarbonate (control group) or 4·2% of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion (bicarbonate group) to maintain the arterial pH above 7·30. Our protocol recommended that the volume of each infusion should be within the range of 125-250 mL in 30 min, with a maximum of 1000 mL within 24 h after inclusion. Randomisation criteria were stratified among three prespecified strata: age, sepsis status, and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7. All analyses were done on data from the intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who underwent randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02476253.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between May 5, 2015, and May 7, 2017, we enrolled 389 patients into the intention-to-treat analysis in the overall population (194 in the control group and 195 in the bicarbonate group). The primary outcome occurred in 138 (71%) of 194 patients in the control group and 128 (66%) of 195 in the bicarbonate group (absolute difference estimate -5·5%, 95% CI -15·2 to 4·2; p=0·24). The Kaplan-Meier method estimate of the probability of survival at day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was not significant (46% [95% CI 40-54] vs 55% [49-63]; p=0·09. In the prespecified AKIN stratum of patients with a score of 2 or 3, the Kaplan-Meier method estimate of survival by day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was significant (37% [95% CI 28-48] vs 54% [45-65]; p=0·0283). [corrected] Metabolic alkalosis, hypernatraemia, and hypocalcaemia were observed more frequently in the bicarbonate group than in the control group, with no life-threatening complications reported.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      In patients with severe metabolic acidaemia, sodium bicarbonate had no effect on the primary composite outcome. However, sodium bicarbonate decreased the primary composite outcome and day 28 mortality in the a-priori defined stratum of patients with acute kidney injury.

"Efficacy and safety of sulbactam-durlobactam versus colistin for the treatment of patients with serious infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex: a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority clinical trial (ATTACK).","Keith S Kaye, Andrew F Shorr, Richard G Wunderink, Bin Du, Gabrielle E Poirier, Khurram Rana, Alita Miller, Drew Lewis, John O'Donnell, Lan Chen, Harald Reinhart, Subasree Srinivasan, Robin Isaacs, David Altarac, Keith S Kayeet al.",2023 Sep,Lancet Infect Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37182534/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      An urgent need exists for antibiotics to treat infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC). Sulbactam-durlobactam is a β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination with activity against Acinetobacter, including multidrug-resistant strains. In a phase 3, pathogen-specific, randomised controlled trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of sulbactam-durlobactam versus colistin, both in combination with imipenem-cilastatin as background therapy, in patients with serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant ABC.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The ATTACK trial was done at 59 clinical sites in 16 countries. Adults aged 18 years or older with ABC-confirmed hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, ventilated pneumonia, or bloodstream infections were randomised 1:1 using a block size of four to sulbactam-durlobactam (1·0 g of each drug in combination over 3 h every 6 h) or colistin (2·5 mg/kg over 30 min every 12 h) for 7-14 days. All patients received imipenem-cilastatin (1·0 g of each drug in combination over 1 h every 6 h) as background therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant ABC (the carbapenem-resistant ABC microbiologically modified intention-to-treat population). Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than +20%. The primary safety endpoint was incidence of nephrotoxicity assessed using modified Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage renal disease criteria measured by creatinine level or glomerular filtration rate through day 42. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03894046.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Sep 5, 2019, and July 26, 2021, 181 patients were randomly assigned to sulbactam-durlobactam or colistin (176 hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, or ventilated pneumonia; and five bloodstream infections); 125 patients with laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant ABC isolates were included in the primary efficacy analysis. 28-day all-cause mortality was 12 (19%) of 63 in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 20 (32%) of 62 in the colistin group, a difference of -13·2% (95% CI -30·0 to 3·5), which met criteria for non-inferiority. Incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly (p<0·001) lower with sulbactam-durlobactam than colistin (12 [13%] of 91 vs 32 [38%] of 85). Serious adverse events were reported in 36 (40%) of 91 patients in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 42 (49%) of 86 patients in the colistin group. Treatment-related adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation were reported in ten (11%) of 91 patients in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 14 (16%) of 86 patients in the colistin group.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Our data show that sulbactam-durlobactam was non-inferior to colistin, both agents given in combination with imipenem-cilastatin, for the primary endpoint of 28-day all-cause mortality. Sulbactam-durlobactam was well tolerated and could be an effective intervention to reduce mortality from serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant ABC, including multidrug-resistant strains.

      The cardiovascular safety of testosterone-replacement therapy in middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism has not been determined.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial, we enrolled 5246 men 45 to 80 years of age who had preexisting or a high risk of cardiovascular disease and who reported symptoms of hypogonadism and had two fasting testosterone levels of less than 300 ng per deciliter. Patients were randomly assigned to receive daily transdermal 1.62% testosterone gel (dose adjusted to maintain testosterone levels between 350 and 750 ng per deciliter) or placebo gel. The primary cardiovascular safety end point was the first occurrence of any component of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, assessed in a time-to-event analysis. A secondary cardiovascular end point was the first occurrence of any component of the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization, assessed in a time-to-event analysis. Noninferiority required an upper limit of less than 1.5 for the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio among patients receiving at least one dose of testosterone or placebo.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean (±SD) duration of treatment was 21.7±14.1 months, and the mean follow-up was 33.0±12.1 months. A primary cardiovascular end-point event occurred in 182 patients (7.0%) in the testosterone group and in 190 patients (7.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.17; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Similar findings were observed in sensitivity analyses in which data on events were censored at various times after discontinuation of testosterone or placebo. The incidence of secondary end-point events or of each of the events of the composite primary cardiovascular end point appeared to be similar in the two groups. A higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, of acute kidney injury, and of pulmonary embolism was observed in the testosterone group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In men with hypogonadism and preexisting or a high risk of cardiovascular disease, testosterone-replacement therapy was noninferior to placebo with respect to the incidence of major adverse cardiac events. (Funded by AbbVie and others; TRAVERSE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03518034.)."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious and common complication of cardiac surgery, for which reduced kidney perfusion is a key contributing factor. Intravenous amino acids increase kidney perfusion and recruit renal functional reserve. However, the efficacy of amino acids in reducing the occurrence of AKI after cardiac surgery is uncertain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a multinational, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adult patients who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass to receive an intravenous infusion of either a balanced mixture of amino acids, at a dose of 2 g per kilogram of ideal body weight per day, or placebo (Ringer's solution) for up to 3 days. The primary outcome was the occurrence of AKI, defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria. Secondary outcomes included the severity of AKI, the use and duration of kidney-replacement therapy, and all-cause 30-day mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We recruited 3511 patients at 22 centers in three countries and assigned 1759 patients to the amino acid group and 1752 to the placebo group. AKI occurred in 474 patients (26.9%) in the amino acid group and in 555 (31.7%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.94; P = 0.002). Stage 3 AKI occurred in 29 patients (1.6%) and 52 patients (3.0%), respectively (relative risk, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.87). Kidney-replacement therapy was used in 24 patients (1.4%) in the amino acid group and in 33 patients (1.9%) in the placebo group. There were no substantial differences between the two groups in other secondary outcomes or in adverse events.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery, infusion of amino acids reduced the occurrence of AKI. (Funded by the Italian Ministry of Health; PROTECTION ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03709264.)."
Balanced Multielectrolyte Solution versus Saline in Critically Ill Adults.,"Simon Finfer, Sharon Micallef, Naomi Hammond, Leanlove Navarra, Rinaldo Bellomo, Laurent Billot, Anthony Delaney, Martin Gallagher, David Gattas, Qiang Li, Diane Mackle, Jayanthi Mysore, Manoj Saxena, Colman Taylor, Paul Young, John Myburgh                              ;, PLUS Study Investigators and the Australian New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group, Simon Finferet al.",2022 Mar 3,N Engl J Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35041780/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Whether the use of balanced multielectrolyte solution (BMES) in preference to 0.9% sodium chloride solution (saline) in critically ill patients reduces the risk of acute kidney injury or death is uncertain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned critically ill patients to receive BMES (Plasma-Lyte 148) or saline as fluid therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 90 days. The primary outcome was death from any cause within 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were receipt of new renal-replacement therapy and the maximum increase in the creatinine level during ICU stay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 5037 patients were recruited from 53 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand - 2515 patients were assigned to the BMES group and 2522 to the saline group. Death within 90 days after randomization occurred in 530 of 2433 patients (21.8%) in the BMES group and in 530 of 2413 patients (22.0%) in the saline group, for a difference of -0.15 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -3.60 to 3.30; P = 0.90). New renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 306 of 2403 patients (12.7%) in the BMES group and in 310 of 2394 patients (12.9%) in the saline group, for a difference of -0.20 percentage points (95% CI, -2.96 to 2.56). The mean (±SD) maximum increase in serum creatinine level was 0.41±1.06 mg per deciliter (36.6±94.0 μmol per liter) in the BMES group and 0.41±1.02 mg per deciliter (36.1±90.0 μmol per liter) in the saline group, for a difference of 0.01 mg per deciliter (95% CI, -0.05 to 0.06) (0.5 μmol per liter [95% CI, -4.7 to 5.7]). The number of adverse and serious adverse events did not differ meaningfully between the groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We found no evidence that the risk of death or acute kidney injury among critically ill adults in the ICU was lower with the use of BMES than with saline.

          Patients:
        
      
      Children up to 15 years of age with septic shock.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Children were randomized to receive fluid boluses of either MES (PlasmaLyte A) or 0.9% saline at the time of identification of shock. All children were managed as per standard protocols and monitored until discharge/death. The primary outcome was new and/or progressive acute kidney injury (AKI), at any time within the first 7 days of fluid resuscitation. Key secondary outcomes included hyperchloremia, any adverse event (AE), at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and all-cause ICU mortality.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      MES solution ( n = 351) versus 0.9% saline ( n = 357) for bolus fluid resuscitation during the first 7 days.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      The median age was 5 years (interquartile range, 1.3-9); 302 (43%) were girls. The relative risk (RR) for meeting the criteria for new and/or progressive AKI was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.49-0.80; p < 0.001), favoring the MES (21%) versus the saline (33%) group. The proportions of children with hyperchloremia were lower in the MES versus the saline group at 24, 48, and 72 hours. There was no difference in the ICU mortality (33% in the MES vs 34% in the saline group). There was no difference with regard to infusion-related AEs such as fever, thrombophlebitis, or fluid overload between the groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among children presenting with septic shock, fluid resuscitation with MES (balanced crystalloid) as compared with 0.9% saline resulted in a significantly lower incidence of new and/or progressive AKI during the first 7 days of hospitalization."

      In a pragmatic, international trial, we randomly assigned 3000 patients who had an increased risk of complications while undergoing major abdominal surgery to receive a restrictive or liberal intravenous-fluid regimen during and up to 24 hours after surgery. The primary outcome was disability-free survival at 1 year. Key secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury at 30 days, renal-replacement therapy at 90 days, and a composite of septic complications, surgical-site infection, or death.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During and up to 24 hours after surgery, 1490 patients in the restrictive fluid group had a median intravenous-fluid intake of 3.7 liters (interquartile range, 2.9 to 4.9), as compared with 6.1 liters (interquartile range, 5.0 to 7.4) in 1493 patients in the liberal fluid group (P<0.001). The rate of disability-free survival at 1 year was 81.9% in the restrictive fluid group and 82.3% in the liberal fluid group (hazard ratio for death or disability, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.24; P=0.61). The rate of acute kidney injury was 8.6% in the restrictive fluid group and 5.0% in the liberal fluid group (P<0.001). The rate of septic complications or death was 21.8% in the restrictive fluid group and 19.8% in the liberal fluid group (P=0.19); rates of surgical-site infection (16.5% vs. 13.6%, P=0.02) and renal-replacement therapy (0.9% vs. 0.3%, P=0.048) were higher in the restrictive fluid group, but the between-group difference was not significant after adjustment for multiple testing.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients at increased risk for complications during major abdominal surgery, a restrictive fluid regimen was not associated with a higher rate of disability-free survival than a liberal fluid regimen and was associated with a higher rate of acute kidney injury.

"Effect of Vancomycin or Daptomycin With vs Without an Antistaphylococcal β-Lactam on Mortality, Bacteremia, Relapse, or Treatment Failure in Patients With MRSA Bacteremia: A Randomized Clinical Trial.","Steven Y C Tong, David C Lye, Dafna Yahav, Archana Sud, J Owen Robinson, Jane Nelson, Sophia Archuleta, Matthew A Roberts, Alan Cass, David L Paterson, Hong Foo, Mical Paul, Stephen D Guy, Adrian R Tramontana, Genevieve B Walls, Stephen McBride, Narin Bak, Niladri Ghosh, Benjamin A Rogers, Anna P Ralph, Jane Davies, Patricia E Ferguson, Ravindra Dotel, Genevieve L McKew, Timothy J Gray, Natasha E Holmes, Simon Smith, Morgyn S Warner, Shirin Kalimuddin, Barnaby E Young, Naomi Runnegar, David N Andresen, Nicholas A Anagnostou, Sandra A Johnson, Mark D Chatfield, Allen C Cheng, Vance G Fowler Jr, Benjamin P Howden, Niamh Meagher, David J Price, Sebastiaan J van Hal, Matthew V N O'Sullivan, Joshua S Davis                                                            ;, Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network, Steven Y C Tonget al.",2020 Feb 11,JAMA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32044943/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is associated with mortality of more than 20%. Combining standard therapy with a β-lactam antibiotic has been associated with reduced mortality, although adequately powered randomized clinical trials of this intervention have not been conducted.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether combining an antistaphylococcal β-lactam with standard therapy is more effective than standard therapy alone in patients with MRSA bacteremia.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 27 hospital sites in 4 countries from August 2015 to July 2018 among 352 hospitalized adults with MRSA bacteremia. Follow-up was complete on October 23, 2018.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants were randomized to standard therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin) plus an antistaphylococcal β-lactam (intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin) (n = 174) or standard therapy alone (n = 178). Total duration of therapy was determined by treating clinicians and the β-lactam was administered for 7 days.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary end point was a 90-day composite of mortality, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, and microbiological treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included mortality at days 14, 42, and 90; persistent bacteremia at days 2 and 5; acute kidney injury (AKI); microbiological relapse; microbiological treatment failure; and duration of intravenous antibiotics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study prior to enrollment of 440 patients because of safety. Among 352 patients randomized (mean age, 62.2 [SD, 17.7] years; 121 women [34.4%]), 345 (98%) completed the trial. The primary end point was met by 59 (35%) with combination therapy and 68 (39%) with standard therapy (absolute difference, -4.2%; 95% CI, -14.3% to 6.0%). Seven of 9 prespecified secondary end points showed no significant difference. For the combination therapy vs standard therapy groups, all-cause 90-day mortality occurred in 35 (21%) vs 28 (16%) (difference, 4.5%; 95% CI, -3.7% to 12.7%); persistent bacteremia at day 5 was observed in 19 of 166 (11%) vs 35 of 172 (20%) (difference, -8.9%; 95% CI, -16.6% to -1.2%); and, excluding patients receiving dialysis at baseline, AKI occurred in 34 of 145 (23%) vs 9 of 145 (6%) (difference, 17.2%; 95% CI, 9.3%-25.2%).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients with MRSA bacteremia, addition of an antistaphylococcal β-lactam to standard antibiotic therapy with vancomycin or daptomycin did not result in significant improvement in the primary composite end point of mortality, persistent bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure. Early trial termination for safety concerns and the possibility that the study was underpowered to detect clinically important differences in favor of the intervention should be considered when interpreting the findings.

      The benefit of combination neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibition in patients with locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma is unknown. We assess the antitumor activity of neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The KEYNOTE-585 study is a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 study done at 143 medical centres in 24 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with untreated, locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive voice response system and integrated web response system to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously or placebo (saline) plus cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy (main cohort) every 3 weeks for 3 cycles, followed by surgery, adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo plus chemotherapy for 3 cycles, then adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 11 cycles. A small cohort was also randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab or placebo plus fluorouracil, docetaxel, and oxaliplatin (FLOT)-based chemotherapy (FLOT cohort) every 2 weeks for four cycles, followed by surgery, adjuvant pembrolizumab, or placebo plus FLOT for four cycles, then adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 11 cycles. Patients were stratified by geographic region, tumour stage, and chemotherapy backbone. Primary endpoints were pathological complete response (reviewed centrally), event-free survival (reviewed by the investigator), and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population, and safety assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03221426, and is closed to accrual.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Oct 9, 2017, and Jan 25, 2021, of 1254 patients screened, 804 were randomly assigned to the main cohort, of whom 402 were assigned to the pembrolizumab plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy group and 402 to the placebo plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy group, and 203 to the FLOT cohort, of whom 100 were assigned to the pembrolizumab plus FLOT group and 103 to placebo plus FLOT group. In the main cohort of 804 participants, 575 (72%) were male and 229 (28%) were female. In the main cohort, after median follow-up of 47·7 months (IQR 38·0-54·8), pembrolizumab was superior to placebo for pathological complete response (52 [12·9%; 95% CI 9·8-16·6] of 402 vs eight [2·0%; 0·9-3·9] of 402; difference 10·9%, 95% CI 7·5 to 14·8; p<0·00001). Median event-free survival was longer with pembrolizumab versus placebo (44·4 months, 95% CI 33·0 to not reached vs 25·3 months, 20·6 to 33·9; hazard ratio [HR] 0·81, 95% CI 0·67 to 0·99; p=0·0198) but did not meet the threshold for statistical significance (p=0·0178). Median overall survival was 60·7 months (95% CI 51·5 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 58·0 months (41·5 to not reached) in the placebo group (HR 0·90, 95% CI 0·73 to 1·12; p=0·174). Grade 3 or worse adverse events of any cause occurred in 312 (78%) of 399 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 297 (74%) of 400 patients in the placebo group; the most common were nausea (240 [60%] vs 247 [62%]), anaemia (168 [42%] vs 158 [40%]), and decreased appetite (163 [41%] vs 172 [43%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 102 (26%) and 97 (24%) patients. Treatment-related adverse events that led to death occurred in four (1%) patients in the pembrolizumab group (interstitial ischaemia, pneumonia, decreased appetite, and acute kidney injury [n=1 each]) and two (<1%) patients in the placebo group (neutropenic sepsis and neutropenic colitis [n=1 each]).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Although neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab versus placebo improved the pathological complete response, it did not translate to significant improvement in event-free survival in patients with untreated, locally advanced resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal cancer.

      Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma is generally incurable and has scarce treatment options, especially for cisplatin-ineligible patients previously treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy. Enfortumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate directed at Nectin-4, a protein highly expressed in urothelial carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enfortumab vedotin in the post-immunotherapy setting in cisplatin-ineligible patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      EV-201 is a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 study of enfortumab vedotin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma previously treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. Cohort 2 included adults (aged ≥18 years) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 2 or less who were considered ineligible for cisplatin at enrolment and who had not received platinum-containing chemotherapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. Enfortumab vedotin was given intravenously at a dose of 1·25 mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 assessed by blinded independent central review. Efficacy and safety were analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of enfortumab vedotin. EV-201 is an ongoing study and the primary analysis is complete. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03219333.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Oct 8, 2017, and Feb 11, 2020, 91 patients were enrolled at 40 sites globally, of whom 89 received treatment. Median follow-up was 13·4 months (IQR 11·3-18·9). At data cutoff (Sept 8, 2020), the confirmed objective response rate was 52% (46 of 89 patients; 95% CI 41-62), with 18 (20%) of 89 patients achieving a complete response and 28 (31%) achieving a partial response. 49 (55%) of 89 patients had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events. The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (eight [9%] patients), maculopapular rash (seven [8%] patients), and fatigue (six [7%] patients). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 15 (17%) patients. Three (3%) patients died due to acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (one [1%] each) within 30 days of first dose and these deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to treatment; a fourth death from pneumonitis occurred more than 30 days after the last dose and was also considered to be related to treatment.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Treatment with enfortumab vedotin was tolerable and confirmed responses were seen in 52% of cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were previously treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. These patients have few treatment options, and enfortumab vedotin could be a promising new therapy for a patient population with a high unmet need.

      Comparative clinical effects of balanced crystalloids and saline are uncertain, particularly in noncritically ill patients cared for outside an intensive care unit (ICU).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a single-center, pragmatic, multiple-crossover trial comparing balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) with saline among adults who were treated with intravenous crystalloids in the emergency department and were subsequently hospitalized outside an ICU. The type of crystalloid that was administered in the emergency department was assigned to each patient on the basis of calendar month, with the entire emergency department crossing over between balanced crystalloids and saline monthly during the 16-month trial. The primary outcome was hospital-free days (days alive after discharge before day 28). Secondary outcomes included major adverse kidney events within 30 days - a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to ≥200% of baseline) - all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 13,347 patients were enrolled, with a median crystalloid volume administered in the emergency department of 1079 ml and 88.3% of the patients exclusively receiving the assigned crystalloid. The number of hospital-free days did not differ between the balanced-crystalloids and saline groups (median, 25 days in each group; adjusted odds ratio with balanced crystalloids, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.04; P=0.41). Balanced crystalloids resulted in a lower incidence of major adverse kidney events within 30 days than saline (4.7% vs. 5.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.95; P=0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among noncritically ill adults treated with intravenous fluids in the emergency department, there was no difference in hospital-free days between treatment with balanced crystalloids and treatment with saline.

      Advanced biliary tract cancer has a poor prognosis. Cisplatin and gemcitabine is the standard first-line chemotherapy regimen, but no robust evidence is available for second-line chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the benefit derived from second-line FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy in advanced biliary tract cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The ABC-06 clinical trial was a phase 3, open-label, randomised trial done in 20 sites with expertise in managing biliary tract cancer across the UK. Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who had histologically or cytologically verified locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer (including cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder or ampullary carcinoma) with documented radiological disease progression to first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally to active symptom control (ASC) and FOLFOX or ASC alone. FOLFOX chemotherapy was administered intravenously every 2 weeks for a maximum of 12 cycles (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, L-folinic acid 175 mg [or folinic acid 350 mg], fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 [bolus], and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 as a 46-h continuous intravenous infusion). Randomisation was done following a minimisation algorithm using platinum sensitivity, serum albumin concentration, and stage as stratification factors. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was also assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The study is complete and the final results are reported. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01926236, and EudraCT, 2013-001812-30.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between March 27, 2014, and Jan 4, 2018, 162 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to ASC plus FOLFOX (n=81) or ASC alone (n=81). Median follow-up was 21·7 months (IQR 17·2-30·8). Overall survival was significantly longer in the ASC plus FOLFOX group than in the ASC alone group, with a median overall survival of 6·2 months (95% CI 5·4-7·6) in the ASC plus FOLFOX group versus 5·3 months (4·1-5·8) in the ASC alone group (adjusted hazard ratio 0·69 [95% CI 0·50-0·97]; p=0·031). The overall survival rate in the ASC alone group was 35·5% (95% CI 25·2-46·0) at 6 months and 11·4% (5·6-19·5) at 12 months, compared with 50·6% (39·3-60·9) at 6 months and 25·9% (17·0-35·8) at 12 months in the ASC plus FOLFOX group. Grade 3-5 adverse events were reported in 42 (52%) of 81 patients in the ASC alone group and 56 (69%) of 81 patients in the ASC plus FOLFOX group, including three chemotherapy-related deaths (one each due to infection, acute kidney injury, and febrile neutropenia). The most frequently reported grade 3-5 FOLFOX-related adverse events were neutropenia (ten [12%] patients), fatigue or lethargy (nine [11%] patients), and infection (eight [10%] patients).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      The addition of FOLFOX to ASC improved median overall survival in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer after progression on cisplatin and gemcitabine, with a clinically meaningful increase in 6-month and 12-month overall survival rates. To our knowledge, this trial is the first prospective, randomised study providing reliable, high-quality evidence to allow an informed discussion with patients of the potential benefits and risks from second-line FOLFOX chemotherapy in advanced biliary tract cancer. Based on these findings, FOLFOX should become standard-of-care chemotherapy in second-line treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer and the reference regimen for further clinical trials.

      In this multicenter, double-blind, superiority, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned adult patients without known methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization who were undergoing arthroplasty to receive 1.5 g of vancomycin or normal saline placebo, in addition to cefazolin prophylaxis. The primary outcome was surgical-site infection within 90 days after surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 4239 patients underwent randomization. Among 4113 patients in the modified intention-to-treat population (2233 undergoing knee arthroplasty, 1850 undergoing hip arthroplasty, and 30 undergoing shoulder arthroplasty), surgical-site infections occurred in 91 of 2044 patients (4.5%) in the vancomycin group and in 72 of 2069 patients (3.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.73; P = 0.11). Among patients undergoing knee arthroplasty, surgical-site infections occurred in 63 of 1109 patients (5.7%) in the vancomyin group and in 42 of 1124 patients (3.7%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.23). Among patients undergoing hip arthroplasty, surgical-site infections occurred in 28 of 920 patients (3.0%) in the vancomyin group and in 29 of 930 patients (3.1%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.63). Adverse events occurred in 35 of 2010 patients (1.7%) in the vancomycin group and in 35 of 2030 patients (1.7%) in the placebo group, including hypersensitivity reactions in 24 of 2010 patients (1.2%) and 11 of 2030 patients (0.5%), respectively (relative risk, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.49), and acute kidney injury in 42 of 2010 patients (2.1%) and 74 of 2030 patients (3.6%), respectively (relative risk, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.83).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The addition of vancomycin to cefazolin prophylaxis was not superior to placebo for the prevention of surgical-site infections in arthroplasty among patients without known MRSA colonization.

      Intravenous sodium bicarbonate and oral acetylcysteine are widely used to prevent acute kidney injury and associated adverse outcomes after angiography without definitive evidence of their efficacy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 5177 patients at high risk for renal complications who were scheduled for angiography to receive intravenous 1.26% sodium bicarbonate or intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride and 5 days of oral acetylcysteine or oral placebo; of these patients, 4993 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The primary end point was a composite of death, the need for dialysis, or a persistent increase of at least 50% from baseline in the serum creatinine level at 90 days. Contrast-associated acute kidney injury was a secondary end point.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The sponsor stopped the trial after a prespecified interim analysis. There was no interaction between sodium bicarbonate and acetylcysteine with respect to the primary end point (P=0.33). The primary end point occurred in 110 of 2511 patients (4.4%) in the sodium bicarbonate group as compared with 116 of 2482 (4.7%) in the sodium chloride group (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.22; P=0.62) and in 114 of 2495 patients (4.6%) in the acetylcysteine group as compared with 112 of 2498 (4.5%) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.33; P=0.88). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of contrast-associated acute kidney injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients at high risk for renal complications who were undergoing angiography, there was no benefit of intravenous sodium bicarbonate over intravenous sodium chloride or of oral acetylcysteine over placebo for the prevention of death, need for dialysis, or persistent decline in kidney function at 90 days or for the prevention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury.

      Limited evidence exists to show that adding a third agent to platinum-doublet chemotherapy improves efficacy in the first-line advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) setting. The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and has a non-overlapping toxicity profile with chemotherapy. We assessed whether the addition of pembrolizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy improves efficacy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 cohort of a multicohort study (KEYNOTE-021), patients were enrolled at 26 medical centres in the USA and Taiwan. Patients with chemotherapy-naive, stage IIIB or IV, non-squamous NSCLC without targetable EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four stratified by PD-L1 tumour proportion score (<1% vs ≥1%) using an interactive voice-response system to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg plus carboplatin area under curve 5 mg/mL per min and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks followed by pembrolizumab for 24 months and indefinite pemetrexed maintenance therapy or to 4 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed alone followed by indefinite pemetrexed maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response, defined as the percentage of patients with radiologically confirmed complete or partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 assessed by masked, independent central review, in the intention-to-treat population, defined as all patients who were allocated to study treatment. Significance threshold was p<0·025 (one sided). Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned study treatment. This trial, which is closed for enrolment but continuing for follow-up, is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02039674.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Nov 25, 2014, and Jan 25, 2016, 123 patients were enrolled; 60 were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 63 to the chemotherapy alone group. 33 (55%; 95% CI 42-68) of 60 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group achieved an objective response compared with 18 (29%; 18-41) of 63 patients in the chemotherapy alone group (estimated treatment difference 26% [95% CI 9-42%]; p=0·0016). The incidence of grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events was similar between groups (23 [39%] of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 16 [26%] of 62 in the chemotherapy alone group). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group were anaemia (seven [12%] of 59) and decreased neutrophil count (three [5%]); an additional six events each occurred in two (3%) for acute kidney injury, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, neutropenia, and sepsis, and thrombocytopenia. In the chemotherapy alone group, the most common grade 3 or worse events were anaemia (nine [15%] of 62) and decreased neutrophil count, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia (two [3%] each). One (2%) of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group experienced treatment-related death because of sepsis compared with two (3%) of 62 patients in the chemotherapy group: one because of sepsis and one because of pancytopenia.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Combination of pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed could be an effective and tolerable first-line treatment option for patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. This finding is being further explored in an ongoing international, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study.

Dosing guidance for intravenous colistin in critically-ill patients.,"Roger L Nation, Samira M Garonzik, Visanu Thamlikitkul, Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Alan Forrest, David L Paterson, Jian Li, Fernanda P Silveira, Roger L Nationet al.",2017 Mar 1,Clin Infect Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28011614/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intravenous colistin is difficult to use because plasma concentrations for antibacterial effect overlap those causing nephrotoxicity, and there is large inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetics. The aim was to develop dosing algorithms for achievement of a clinically desirable average steady-state plasma colistin concentration (Css,avg) of 2mg/L.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Plasma concentration-time data from 214 adult critically-ill patients (creatinine clearance 0-236mL/min; 29 receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT)) were subjected to population pharmacokinetic analysis. Development of an algorithm for patients not receiving RRT was based upon the relationship between the dose of colistimethate that would be needed to achieve a desired Css,avg and creatinine clearance. The increase in colistin clearance when patients were on RRT was determined from the population analysis and guided the supplemental dosing needed. To balance potential antibacterial benefit against risk of nephrotoxicity the algorithms were designed to achieve target attainment rates of >80% for Css,avg ≥2 and <30% for Css,avg ≥4mg/L.
    


          Results:
        
      
      When algorithm doses were applied back to individual patients not on RRT (including patients prescribed intermittent dialysis on a non-dialysis day), >80% of patients with creatinine clearance <80mL/min achieved Css,avg ≥2mg/L; but for patients with creatinine clearance ≥80mL/min target attainment was <40%, even with the maximum allowed daily dose of 360mg colistin base activity. For patients receiving RRT, target attainment rates were >80% with the proposed supplemental dosing. In all categories of patients, <30% of patients attained Css,avg ≥4mg/L.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The project has generated clinician-friendly dosing algorithms and pointed to circumstances where intravenous monotherapy may be inadequate."

      HER2 is an actionable target in metastatic colorectal cancer. We assessed the activity of tucatinib plus trastuzumab in patients with chemotherapy-refractory, HER2-positive, RAS wild-type unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      MOUNTAINEER is a global, open-label, phase 2 study that enrolled patients aged 18 years and older with chemotherapy-refractory, HER2-positive, RAS wild-type unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer at 34 sites (clinics and hospitals) in five countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, and the USA). Initially, the study was designed as a single-cohort study, which was expanded following an interim analysis to include more patients. Initially, patients were given tucatinib (300 mg orally twice daily) plus intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg as an initial loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 21 days; cohort A) for the duration of treatment (until progression), and after expansion, patients were randomly assigned (4:3), using an interactive web response system and stratified by primary tumour location, to either tucatinib plus trastuzumab (cohort B) or tucatinib monotherapy (cohort C). The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate per blinded independent central review (BICR) for cohorts A and B combined and was assessed in patients in the full analysis set (ie, patients with HER2-positive disease who received at least one dose of study treatment). Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03043313, and is ongoing.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Aug 8, 2017, and Sept 22, 2021, 117 patients were enrolled (45 in cohort A, 41 in cohort B, and 31 in cohort C), of whom 114 patients had locally assessed HER2-positive disease and received treatment (45 in cohort A, 39 in cohort B, and 30 in cohort C; full analysis set), and 116 patients received at least one dose of study treatment (45 in cohort A, 41 in cohort B, and 30 in cohort C; safety population). In the full analysis set, median age was 56·0 years (IQR 47-64), 66 (58%) were male, 48 (42%) were female, 88 (77%) were White, and six (5%) were Black or African American. As of data cutoff (March 28, 2022), in 84 patients from cohorts A and B in the full analysis set, the confirmed objective response rate per BICR was 38·1% (95% CI 27·7-49·3; three patients had a complete response and 29 had a partial response). In cohorts A and B, the most common adverse event was diarrhoea (55 [64%] of 86), the most common grade 3 or worse adverse event was hypertension (six [7%] of 86), and three (3%) patients had tucatinib-related serious adverse events (acute kidney injury, colitis, and fatigue). In cohort C, the most common adverse event was diarrhoea (ten [33%] of 30), the most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (both two [7%]), and one (3%) patient had a tucatinib-related serious adverse event (overdose). No deaths were attributed to adverse events. All deaths in treated patients were due to disease progression.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Tucatinib plus trastuzumab had clinically meaningful anti-tumour activity and favourable tolerability. This treatment is the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-HER2 regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer and is an important new treatment option for chemotherapy-refractory HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer.

"Colistin alone versus colistin plus meropenem for treatment of severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria: an open-label, randomised controlled trial.","Mical Paul, George L Daikos, Emanuele Durante-Mangoni, Dafna Yahav, Yehuda Carmeli, Yael Dishon Benattar, Anna Skiada, Roberto Andini, Noa Eliakim-Raz, Amir Nutman, Oren Zusman, Anastasia Antoniadou, Pia Clara Pafundi, Amos Adler, Yaakov Dickstein, Ioannis Pavleas, Rosa Zampino, Vered Daitch, Roni Bitterman, Hiba Zayyad, Fidi Koppel, Inbar Levi, Tanya Babich, Lena E Friberg, Johan W Mouton, Ursula Theuretzbacher, Leonard Leibovici, Mical Paulet al.",2018 Apr,Lancet Infect Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29456043/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Colistin-carbapenem combinations are synergistic in vitro against carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. We aimed to test whether combination therapy improves clinical outcomes for adults with infections caused by carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A randomised controlled superiority trial was done in six hospitals in Israel, Greece, and Italy. We included adults with bacteraemia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or urosepsis caused by carbapenem-non-susceptible Gram-negative bacteria. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally, by computer-generated permuted blocks stratified by centre, to intravenous colistin (9-million unit loading dose, followed by 4·5 million units twice per day) or colistin with meropenem (2-g prolonged infusion three times per day). The trial was open-label, with blinded outcome assessment. Treatment success was defined as survival, haemodynamic stability, improved or stable Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, stable or improved ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of expired oxygen for patients with pneumonia, and microbiological cure for patients with bacteraemia. The primary outcome was clinical failure, defined as not meeting all success criteria by intention-to-treat analysis, at 14 days after randomisation. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01732250, and is closed to accrual.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Oct 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2016, we randomly assigned 406 patients to the two treatment groups. Most patients had pneumonia or bacteraemia (355/406, 87%), and most infections were caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (312/406, 77%). No significant difference between colistin monotherapy (156/198, 79%) and combination therapy (152/208, 73%) was observed for clinical failure at 14 days after randomisation (risk difference -5·7%, 95% CI -13·9 to 2·4; risk ratio [RR] 0·93, 95% CI 0·83-1·03). Results were similar among patients with A baumannii infections (RR 0·97, 95% CI 0·87-1·09). Combination therapy increased the incidence of diarrhoea (56 [27%] vs 32 [16%] patients) and decreased the incidence of mild renal failure (37 [30%] of 124 vs 25 [20%] of 125 patients at risk of or with kidney injury).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Combination therapy was not superior to monotherapy. The addition of meropenem to colistin did not improve clinical failure in severe A baumannii infections. The trial was unpowered to specifically address other bacteria.

Terlipressin Is Superior to Noradrenaline in the Management of Acute Kidney Injury in Acute on Chronic Liver Failure.,"Vinod Arora, Rakhi Maiwall, Vijayaraghavan Rajan, Ankur Jindal, Saggere Muralikrishna Shasthry, Guresh Kumar, Priyanka Jain, Shiv Kumar Sarin, Vinod Aroraet al.",2020 Feb,Hepatology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30076614/,No keywords found,"Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) carries a high short-term mortality in patients with cirrhosis and acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Terlipressin and noradrenaline are routinely used in cirrhosis with HRS and have been found to be equally effective. There are no data comparing the efficacy of terlipressin with noradrenaline in ACLF patients with HRS. In an open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT), consecutive patients with ACLF diagnosed with HRS acute kidney injury (AKI) were randomized to albumin with infusion of terlipressin (2-12 mg/day; n = 60) or noradrenaline (0.5-3.0 mg/h; n = 60). Response to treatment, course of AKI, and outcome were studied. Baseline characteristics, including AKI stage and sepsis-related HRS-AKI, were comparable between groups. Compared to noradrenaline, terlipressin achieved greater day 4 (26.1% vs. 11.7%; P = 0.03) and day 7 (41.7% vs. 20%; P = 0.01) response. Reversal of HRS was also better with terlipressin (40% vs. 16.7%; P = 0.004), with a significant reduction in the requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT; 56.6% vs. 80%; P = 0.006) and improved 28-day survival (48.3% vs. 20%; P = 0.001). Adverse events limiting use of drugs were higher with terlipressin than noradrenaline (23.3% vs. 8.3%; P = 0.02), but were reversible. On multivariate analysis, high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD; odds ratio [OR], 1.10; confidence interval [CI] = 1.009-1.20; P = 0.03) and noradrenaline compared to terlipressin (OR, 3.05; CI = 1.27-7.33; P = 0.01) predicted nonresponse to therapy. Use of noradrenaline compared to terlipressin was also predictive of higher mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; CI = 1.32-3.30; P = 0.002). Conclusion: AKI in ACLF carries a high mortality. Infusion of terlipressin gives earlier and higher response than noradrenaline, with improved survival in ACLF patients with HRS-AKI."

The pathophysiology underlying HRS begins with increasing portal pressures leading to the release of vasodilatory substances that result in pooling blood in the splanchnic system and a corresponding reduction in effective circulating volume. Compensatory activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and release of arginine vasopressin serve to defend mean arterial pressure but at the cost of severe constriction of the renal vasculature, leading to a progressive, often fulminant form of AKI. There are no approved treatments for HRS in the United States, but multiple countries, including much of Europe, use terlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analogue, as a first-line therapy. CONFIRM (A Multi-Center, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Double-Blind Study to Confirm Efficacy and Safety of Terlipressin in Subjects With Hepatorenal Syndrome Type 1), the third randomized trial based in North America evaluating terlipressin, met its primary end point of showing greater rates of HRS reversal in the terlipressin arm. However, due to concerns about the apparent increased rates of respiratory adverse events and a lack of evidence for mortality benefit, terlipressin was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We explore the history of regulatory approval for terlipressin in the United States, examine the results from CONFIRM and the concerns they raised, and consider the future role of terlipressin in this critical clinical area of continued unmet need."

      Among 1407 patients randomized, 1386 (99%; mean age, 65.4 [SD, 9.9] years; 1091 men [79%]; 295 women [21%]) completed the trial. Patients received a median of 2150 mL (IQR, 1598-2700 mL) of study fluid in the albumin group and 3298 mL (IQR, 2669-3500 mL) in the Ringer group. The number of patients with at least 1 major adverse event was 257 of 693 patients (37.1%) in the albumin group and 234 of 693 patients (33.8%) in the Ringer group (relative risk albumin/Ringer, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.95-1.27; P = .20), an absolute difference of 3.3 percentage points (95% CI, -1.7 to 8.4). The most common serious adverse events were pulmonary embolus (11 [1.6%] in the albumin group vs 8 [1.2%] in the Ringer group), postpericardiotomy syndrome (9 [1.3%] in both groups), and pleural effusion with intensive care unit or hospital readmission (7 [1.0%] in the albumin group vs 9 [1.3%] in the Ringer group).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, treatment with 4% albumin solution for priming and perioperative intravenous volume replacement solution compared with Ringer acetate did not significantly reduce the risk of major adverse events over the following 90 days. These findings do not support the use of 4% albumin solution in this setting.

Simplified Rapid Hydration Prevents Contrast-Associated Acute Kidney Injury Among CKD Patients Undergoing Coronary Angiography.,"Yong Liu, Ning Tan, Yong Huo, Shi-Qun Chen, Jin Liu, Yan Wang, Lang Li, Jian-Hong Tao, Xi Su, Li Zhang, Qing-Xian Li, Jin-Ying Zhang, Yan-Song Guo, Zhi-Min Du, Yin-Pin Zhou, Zhen-Fei Fang, Guang-Ma Xu, Yan Liang, Ling Tao, Hui Chen, Zheng Ji, Bing Han, Ping-Yan Chen, Jun-Bo Ge, Ya-Ling Han, Ji-Yan Chen, Yong Liuet al.",2023 Jun 26,JACC Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37380233/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) are at high risk of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) and mortality. Therefore, there is a clinical need to explore safe, convenient, and effective strategies for preventing CA-AKI.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study sought to assess whether simplified rapid hydration is noninferior to standard hydration for CA-AKI prevention in patients with CKD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled study was conducted across 21 teaching hospitals and included 1,002 patients with CKD. Patients were randomized to either simplified hydration (SH) (SH group, with normal saline from 1 hour before to 4 hours after CAG at a rate of 3 mL/kg/h) or standard hydration (control group, with normal saline 12 hours before and 12 hours after CAG at a rate of 1 mL/kg/h). The primary endpoint of CA-AKI was a ≥25% or 0.5-mg/dL rise in serum creatinine from baseline within 48 to 72 hours.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CA-AKI occurred in 29 of 466 (6.2%) patients in the SH group and in 38 of 455 (8.4%) patients in the control group (relative risk: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.5-1.2; P = 0.216). In addition, the risk of acute heart failure and 1-year major adverse cardiovascular events did not differ significantly between the groups. However, the median hydration duration was significantly shorter in the SH group than in the control group (6 vs 25 hours; P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In CKD patients undergoing CAG, SH is noninferior to standard hydration in preventing CA-AKI with a shorter hydration duration."

      The β-lactamase inhibitor relebactam can restore imipenem activity against imipenem-nonsusceptible gram-negative pathogens. We evaluated imipenem/relebactam for treating imipenem-nonsusceptible infections.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Randomized, controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial. Hospitalized patients with hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia, complicated intraabdominal infection, or complicated urinary tract infection caused by imipenem-nonsusceptible (but colistin- and imipenem/relebactam-susceptible) pathogens were randomized 2:1 to 5-21 days imipenem/relebactam or colistin+imipenem. Primary endpoint: favorable overall response (defined by relevant endpoints for each infection type) in the modified microbiologic intent-to-treat (mMITT) population (qualifying baseline pathogen and ≥1 dose study treatment). Secondary endpoints: clinical response, all-cause mortality, and treatment-emergent nephrotoxicity. Safety analyses included patients with ≥1 dose study treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-one patients received imipenem/relebactam and 16 colistin+imipenem. Among mITT patients (n = 21 imipenem/relebactam, n = 10 colistin+imipenem), 29% had Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores >15, 23% had creatinine clearance <60 mL/min, and 35% were aged ≥65 years. Qualifying baseline pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (77%), Klebsiella spp. (16%), other Enterobacteriaceae (6%). Favorable overall response was observed in 71% imipenem/relebactam and 70% colistin+imipenem patients (90% confidence interval [CI] for difference, -27.5, 21.4), day 28 favorable clinical response in 71% and 40% (90% CI, 1.3, 51.5), and 28-day mortality in 10% and 30% (90% CI, -46.4, 6.7), respectively. Serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in 10% of imipenem/relebactam and 31% of colistin+imipenem patients, drug-related AEs in 16% and 31% (no drug-related deaths), and treatment-emergent nephrotoxicity in 10% and 56% (P = .002), respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Imipenem/relebactam is an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment option for carbapenem-nonsusceptible infections.

Balanced Crystalloids versus Saline in the Intensive Care Unit. The SALT Randomized Trial.,"Matthew W Semler, Jonathan P Wanderer, Jesse M Ehrenfeld, Joanna L Stollings, Wesley H Self, Edward D Siew, Li Wang, Daniel W Byrne, Andrew D Shaw, Gordon R Bernard, Todd W Rice                              ;, SALT Investigators * and the Pragmatic Critical Care Research Group;, SALT Investigators, Michael J Noto, Todd W Rice, Henry J Domenico, Antonio Hernandez, Avinash B Kumar, Debra F Dunlap, Mark Sullivan, Molly Knostman, David P Mulherin, Fred R Hargrove, David R Janz, Seth Strawbridge, Matthew W Semleret al.",2017 May 15,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27749094/,No keywords found,"Rationale:
        
      
      Saline is the intravenous fluid most commonly administered to critically ill adults, but it may be associated with acute kidney injury and death. Whether use of balanced crystalloids rather than saline affects patient outcomes remains unknown.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To pilot a cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial using software tools within the electronic health record to compare saline to balanced crystalloids.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial among 974 adults admitted to a tertiary medical intensive care unit from February 3, 2015 to May 31, 2015. The intravenous crystalloid used in the unit alternated monthly between saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A). Enrollment, fluid delivery, and data collection were performed using software tools within the electronic health record. The primary outcome was the difference between study groups in the proportion of isotonic crystalloid administered that was saline. The secondary outcome was major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30), a composite of death, dialysis, or persistent renal dysfunction.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Patients assigned to saline (n = 454) and balanced crystalloids (n = 520) were similar at baseline and received similar volumes of crystalloid by 30 days (median [interquartile range]: 1,424 ml [500-3,377] vs. 1,617 ml [500-3,628]; P = 0.40). Saline made up a larger proportion of the isotonic crystalloid given in the saline group than in the balanced crystalloid group (91% vs. 21%; P < 0.001). MAKE30 did not differ between groups (24.7% vs. 24.6%; P = 0.98).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      An electronic health record-embedded, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial comparing saline with balanced crystalloids can produce well-balanced study groups and separation in crystalloid receipt. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 02345486)."

De novo NAD+ biosynthesis from tryptophan is evolutionarily conserved yet considered supplanted among higher species by biosynthesis from nicotinamide (NAM). Here we show that a bottleneck enzyme in de novo biosynthesis, quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), defends renal NAD+ and mediates resistance to acute kidney injury (AKI). Following murine AKI, renal NAD+ fell, quinolinate rose, and QPRT declined. QPRT+/- mice exhibited higher quinolinate, lower NAD+, and higher AKI susceptibility. Metabolomics suggested an elevated urinary quinolinate/tryptophan ratio (uQ/T) as an indicator of reduced QPRT. Elevated uQ/T predicted AKI and other adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. A phase 1 placebo-controlled study of oral NAM demonstrated a dose-related increase in circulating NAD+ metabolites. NAM was well tolerated and was associated with less AKI. Therefore, impaired NAD+ biosynthesis may be a feature of high-risk hospitalizations for which NAD+ augmentation could be beneficial."
Intravenous amino acid therapy for kidney protection in cardiac surgery patients: A pilot randomized controlled trial.,"Hong Pu, Gordon S Doig, Philippa T Heighes, Matilde J Allingstrup, Andy Wang, John Brereton, Carol Pollock, Douglas Chesher, Rinaldo Bellomo, Hong Puet al.",2019 Jun,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30685166/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether a continuous intravenous infusion of standard amino acids could preserve kidney function after on-pump cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Adult patients scheduled to receive cardiac surgery lasting longer than 1 hour on-pump were randomized to standard care (n = 36) or an infusion of amino acids initiated immediately after induction of anesthesia (n = 33). The study's primary outcome measurements assessed renal function. These assessments included duration of renal dysfunction, duration and severity of acute kidney injury (AKI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time, urine output, and use of renal-replacement therapy. Complications and other measures of morbidity were also assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-nine patients (mean age 71.5 [standard deviation 9.2] years; 19 of 69 women) were enrolled and randomized. Patients received coronary artery bypass graft surgery (37/69), valve surgery (24/69), coronary artery bypass graft and valve surgery (6/69), or other procedures (2/69). Mean on-pump time was 268 [standard deviation 136] minutes. Duration of renal dysfunction did not differ between the groups (relative risk, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-3.79, P = .84). However, patients who received the amino acid infusion had a reduced duration of AKI (relative risk, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.005-0.11, P < .0001) and greater eGFR (+10.8%; 95% CI, 1.0%-20.8%, P = .033). Daily mean urine output was also significantly greater in patients who received the amino acid infusion (1.4 ± 0.5 vs 1.7 ± 0.9 L/d; P = .046).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Commencing an infusion of standard amino acids immediately after the induction of anesthesia did not alter duration of renal dysfunction; however, other key measures of renal function (duration of AKI, eGFR and urine output) were significantly improved. These results warrant replication in multicenter clinical trials."
Characterization and implications of the initial estimated glomerular filtration rate 'dip' upon sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition with empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.,"Bettina J Kraus, Matthew R Weir, George L Bakris, Michaela Mattheus, David Z I Cherney, Naveed Sattar, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Ivana Ritter, Maximilian von Eynatten, Bernard Zinman, Silvio E Inzucchi, Christoph Wanner, Audrey Koitka-Weber, Bettina J Krauset al.",2021 Mar,Kidney Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33181154/,"acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibition.","Treatment with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors induces an initial 3-5 ml/min/1.73 m2 decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Although considered to be of hemodynamic origin and largely reversible, this 'eGFR dip' may cause concern in clinical practice, which highlights the need to better understand its incidence and clinical implications. In this post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, 6,668 participants randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg or placebo with eGFR available at baseline and week four were categorized by initial eGFR change into three groups; over 10% decline ('eGFR dipper'), over 0 and up to 10% decline ('eGFR intermediate'), no eGFR decline ('eGFR non-dipper'). Baseline characteristics of 'eGFR intermediate' and 'eGFR non-dipper' were generally comparable. An initial 'eGFR dip' was observed in 28.3% of empagliflozin versus 13.4% of placebo-treated participants; odds ratio 2.7 [95% Confidence Interval 2.3-3.0]. In multivariate logistic regression, diuretic use and higher KDIGO risk category at baseline were independently predictive of an 'eGFR dip' in empagliflozin versus placebo. Safety and beneficial treatment effects with empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were consistent across subgroups based on these predictive factors. The initial 'eGFR dip' did not have a major impact on the treatment effect of empagliflozin on subsequent cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and incident or worsening kidney disease. Thus, patients with type 2 diabetes with more advanced kidney disease and/or on diuretic therapy were more likely to experience an 'eGFR dip' of over 10% with empagliflozin, but reduction in cardiovascular and kidney outcomes was not relevantly modified by such 'eGFR dip.'"

          Methods:
        
      
      In this open-label, multicenter, clinical trial, adults with MRSA bacteremia received vancomycin 1.5 g intravenously twice daily and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous flucloxacillin 2 g every 6 hours for 7 days (combination group) or no additional therapy (standard therapy group). Participants were stratified by hospital and randomized in permuted blocks of variable size. Randomization codes were kept in sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. The primary outcome was the duration of MRSA bacteremia in days.

      We randomly assigned 60 patients to receive vancomycin (n = 29), or vancomycin plus flucloxacillin (n = 31). The mean duration of bacteremia was 3.00 days in the standard therapy group and 1.94 days in the combination group. According to a negative binomial model, the mean time to resolution of bacteremia in the combination group was 65% (95% confidence interval, 41%-102%; P = .06) that in the standard therapy group. There was no difference in the secondary end points of 28- and 90-day mortality, metastatic infection, nephrotoxicity, or hepatotoxicity.

Inhaled Epoprostenol Compared With Nitric Oxide for Right Ventricular Support After Major Cardiac Surgery.,"Kamrouz Ghadimi, Jhaymie L Cappiello, Mary Cooter Wright, Jerrold H Levy, Benjamin S Bryner, Adam D DeVore, Jacob N Schroder, Chetan B Patel, Sudarshan Rajagopal, Svati H Shah, Carmelo A Milano                              ;, INSPIRE-FLO Investigators, Kamrouz Ghadimiet al.",2023 Oct 24,Circulation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37401479/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Right ventricular failure (RVF) is a leading driver of morbidity and death after major cardiac surgery for advanced heart failure, including orthotopic heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device implantation. Inhaled pulmonary-selective vasodilators, such as inhaled epoprostenol (iEPO) and nitric oxide (iNO), are essential therapeutics for the prevention and medical management of postoperative RVF. However, there is limited evidence from clinical trials to guide agent selection despite the significant cost considerations of iNO therapy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this double-blind trial, participants were stratified by assigned surgery and key preoperative prognostic features, then randomized to continuously receive either iEPO or iNO beginning at the time of separation from cardiopulmonary bypass with the continuation of treatment into the intensive care unit stay. The primary outcome was the composite RVF rate after both operations, defined after transplantation by the initiation of mechanical circulatory support for isolated RVF, and defined after left ventricular assist device implantation by moderate or severe right heart failure according to criteria from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support. An equivalence margin of 15 percentage points was prespecified for between-group RVF risk difference. Secondary postoperative outcomes were assessed for treatment differences and included: mechanical ventilation duration; hospital and intensive care unit length of stay during the index hospitalization; acute kidney injury development including renal replacement therapy initiation; and death at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year after surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 231 randomized participants who met eligibility at the time of surgery, 120 received iEPO, and 111 received iNO. Primary outcome occurred in 30 participants (25.0%) in the iEPO group and 25 participants (22.5%) in the iNO group, for a risk difference of 2.5 percentage points (two one-sided test 90% CI, -6.6% to 11.6%) in support of equivalence. There were no significant between-group differences for any of the measured postoperative secondary outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients undergoing major cardiac surgery for advanced heart failure, inhaled pulmonary-selective vasodilator treatment using iEPO was associated with similar risks for RVF development and development of other postoperative secondary outcomes compared with treatment using iNO.

      We compared a restrictive fluid management strategy to usual care among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who had received initial fluid resuscitation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This multicenter feasibility trial randomized 100 AKI patients 1:1 in seven ICUs in Europe and Australia. Restrictive fluid management included targeting negative or neutral daily fluid balance by minimizing fluid input and/or enhancing urine output with diuretics administered at the discretion of the clinician. Fluid boluses were administered as clinically indicated. The primary endpoint was cumulative fluid balance 72 h from randomization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean (SD) cumulative fluid balance at 72 h from randomization was - 1080 mL (2003 mL) in the restrictive fluid management arm and 61 mL (3131 mL) in the usual care arm, mean difference (95% CI) - 1148 mL (- 2200 to - 96) mL, P = 0.033. Median [IQR] duration of AKI was 2 [1-3] and 3 [2-7] days, respectively (median difference - 1.0 [- 3.0 to 0.0], P = 0.071). Altogether, 6 out of 46 (13%) patients in the restrictive fluid management arm and 15 out of 50 (30%) in the usual care arm received renal replacement therapy (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.16-0.91), P = 0.043. Cumulative fluid balance at 24 h and 7 days was lower in the restrictive fluid management arm. The dose of diuretics was not different between the groups. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the usual care arm.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In critically ill patients with AKI, a restrictive fluid management regimen resulted in lower cumulative fluid balance and less adverse events compared to usual care. Larger trials of this intervention are justified."

Strictness of fluid restriction (<1,000 or<500mL/d) was guided by the urine to serum electrolyte ratio. Furosemide dosage was 20 to 40mg/d. NaCl supplements were 3g/d. All treatments were continued for 28 days.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      The primary outcome was change in [Na+] at days 4, 7, 14, and 28 after randomization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      92 patients were recruited (FR, n=31; FR+FM, n=30; FR+FM+NaCl, n=31). Baseline [Na+] was 125±4mmol/L, and there were no significant differences between groups. Mean [Na+] on day 4 in all treatment groups was significantly increased from baseline by 5mmol/L (P<0.001); however, the change in [Na+] was not significantly different across groups (P=0.7). There was no significant difference in percentage of patients or time to reach [Na+] ≥ 130 or≥135mmol/L across the 3 groups. Acute kidney injury and hypokalemia (potassium≤3.0mmol/L) were more common in patients receiving furosemide.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Open-label treatment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with SIAD, furosemide with NaCl supplement in combination with fluid restriction did not show benefits in correction of [Na+] compared with treatment with fluid restriction alone. Incidences of acute kidney injury and hypokalemia were increased in patients receiving furosemide.

"Teprasiran, a Small Interfering RNA, for the Prevention of Acute Kidney Injury in High-Risk Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Study.","Matthias Thielmann#, David Corteville#, Gabor Szabo, Madhav Swaminathan, Andre Lamy, Lukas J Lehner, Craig D Brown, Nicolas Noiseux, Mohamed G Atta, Elizabeth C Squiers, Shai Erlich, Daniel Rothenstein, Bruce Molitoris, C David Mazer#, Matthias Thielmannet al.",2021 Oct 5,Circulation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34474590/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects up to 30% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, leading to increased in-hospital and long-term morbidity and mortality. Teprasiran is a novel small interfering RNA that temporarily inhibits p53-mediated cell death that underlies AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled phase 2 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single 10 mg/kg dose of teprasiran versus placebo (1:1), in reducing the incidence, severity, and duration of AKI after cardiac surgery in high-risk patients. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who developed AKI determined by serum creatinine by postoperative day 5. Other end points included AKI severity and duration using various prespecified criteria. To inform future clinical development, a composite end point of major adverse kidney events at day 90, including death, renal replacement therapy, and ≥25% reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate was assessed. Both serum creatinine and serum cystatin-C were used for estimated glomerular filtration rate assessments.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 360 patients were randomly assigned in 41 centers; 341 dosed patients were 73±7.5 years of age (mean±SD), 72% were men, and median European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation score was 2.6%. Demographics and surgical parameters were similar between groups. AKI incidence was 37% for teprasiran- versus 50% for placebo-treated patients, a 12.8% absolute risk reduction, P=0.02; odds ratio, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.37-0.92). AKI severity and duration were also improved with teprasiran: 2.5% of teprasiran- versus 6.7% of placebo-treated patients had grade 3 AKI; 7% teprasiran- versus 13% placebo-treated patients had AKI lasting for 5 days. No significant difference was observed for the major adverse kidney events at day 90 composite in the overall population. No safety issues were identified with teprasiran treatment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The incidence, severity, and duration of early AKI in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery were significantly reduced after teprasiran administration. A phase 3 study with a major adverse kidney event at day 90 primary outcome that has recently completed enrollment was designed on the basis of these findings (NCT03510897).

Atorvastatin in the treatment of Lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: the protocol of a randomized controlled trial.,"Jocelyn Fotso Soh, Susana G Torres-Platas, Serge Beaulieu, Outi Mantere, Robert Platt, Istvan Mucsi, Sybille Saury, Suzane Renaud, Andrea Levinson, Ana C Andreazza, Benoit H Mulsant, Daniel Müller, Ayal Schaffer, Annemiek Dols, Pablo Cervantes, Nancy Cp Low, Nathan Herrmann, Birgitte M Christensen, Francesco Trepiccione, Tarek Rajji, Soham Rej, Jocelyn Fotso Sohet al.",2018 Jul 16,BMC Psychiatry,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30012135/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Lithium is the gold-standard treatment for bipolar disorder, is highly effective in treating major depressive disorder, and has anti-suicidal properties. However, clinicians are increasingly avoiding lithium largely due to fears of renal toxicity. Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI) occurs in 15-20% of lithium users and predicts a 2-3 times increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We recently found that use of statins is associated with lower NDI risk in a cross-sectional study. In this current paper, we describe the methodology of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to treat lithium-induced NDI using atorvastatin.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We will conduct a 12-week, double-blind placebo-controlled RCT of atorvastatin for lithium-induced NDI at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. We will recruit 60 current lithium users, aged 18-85, who have indicators of NDI, which we defined as urine osmolality (UOsm) < 600 mOsm/kg after 10-h fluid restriction. We will randomize patients to atorvastatin (20 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. We will examine whether this improves measures of NDI: UOsm and aquaporin (AQP2) excretion at 12-week follow-up, adjusted for baseline.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Not applicable.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The aim of this clinical trial is to provide preliminary data about the efficacy of atorvastatin in treating NDI. If successful, lithium could theoretically be used more safely in patients with a reduced subsequent risk of CKD, hypernatremia, and acute kidney injury (AKI). If future definitive trials confirm this, this could potentially allow more patients to benefit from lithium, while minimizing renal risk.

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury.,"Tariq Ahmad, Keyanna Jackson, Veena S Rao, W H Wilson Tang, Meredith A Brisco-Bacik, Horng H Chen, G Michael Felker, Adrian F Hernandez, Christopher M O'Connor, Venkata S Sabbisetti, Joseph V Bonventre, F Perry Wilson, Steven G Coca, Jeffrey M Testani, Tariq Ahmadet al.",2018 May 8,Circulation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29352071/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation-Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300-815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341-10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both P>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (-8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, -169 to 35 ng/mg; P<0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (P=0.21), N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (P=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (P=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.91; P=0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury."
"Right dose, right now: bedside, real-time, data-driven, and personalised antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock-a two-centre randomised clinical trial.","Luca F Roggeveen#, Tingjie Guo#, Lucas M Fleuren#, Ronald Driessen, Patrick Thoral, Reinier M van Hest, Ron A A Mathot, Eleonora L Swart, Harm-Jan de Grooth, Bas van den Bogaard, Armand R J Girbes, Rob J Bosman, Paul W G Elbers, Luca F Roggeveenet al.",2022 Sep 5,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36064438/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Adequate antibiotic dosing may improve outcomes in critically ill patients but is challenging due to altered and variable pharmacokinetics. To address this challenge, AutoKinetics was developed, a decision support system for bedside, real-time, data-driven and personalised antibiotic dosing. This study evaluates the feasibility, safety and efficacy of its clinical implementation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this two-centre randomised clinical trial, critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock were randomised to AutoKinetics dosing or standard dosing for four antibiotics: vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and ceftriaxone. Adult patients with a confirmed or suspected infection and either lactate > 2 mmol/L or vasopressor requirement were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was pharmacokinetic target attainment in the first 24 h after randomisation. Clinical endpoints included mortality, ICU length of stay and incidence of acute kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After inclusion of 252 patients, the study was stopped early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the ciprofloxacin intervention group, the primary outcome was obtained in 69% compared to 3% in the control group (OR 62.5, CI 11.4-1173.78, p < 0.001). Furthermore, target attainment was faster (26 h, CI 18-42 h, p < 0.001) and better (65% increase, CI 49-84%, p < 0.001). For the other antibiotics, AutoKinetics dosing did not improve target attainment. Clinical endpoints were not significantly different. Importantly, higher dosing did not lead to increased mortality or renal failure.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In critically ill patients, personalised dosing was feasible, safe and significantly improved target attainment for ciprofloxacin.

      Although androgen deprivation therapy is typically given long-term for men with metastatic prostate cancer, second-generation hormone therapies are generally discontinued before the subsequent line of treatment. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of continuing enzalutamide after progression in controlling metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with docetaxel and prednisolone.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      PRESIDE was a two-period, multinational, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3b study done at 123 sites in Europe (in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK). Patients were eligible for period 1 (P1) of the study if they had histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma without neuroendocrine differentiation or small-cell features, serum testosterone concentrations of 1·73 nmol/L or less, and had progressed during androgen deprivation therapy with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist or after bilateral orchiectomy. In P1, patients received open-label enzalutamide 160 mg per day orally. At week 13, patients were assessed for either radiographic or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (25% or more increase and 2 ng/mL or more above nadir). Patients who showed any decline in PSA at week 13 and subsequently progressed (radiographic progression, PSA progression, or both) were screened and enrolled in period 2 (P2), during which eligible patients were treated with up to ten cycles of intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and oral prednisolone 10 mg/day, and randomly assigned (1:1) to oral enzalutamide 160 mg/day or oral placebo. Patients were stratified by type of disease progression. The block size was four and the overall number of blocks was 400. Patients, investigators, and study organisers were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival analysed in all patients in P2. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02288247, and is no longer recruiting.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Dec 1, 2014, and Feb 15, 2016, 816 patients were screened for P1 of the study. 688 patients were enrolled in P1 and 687 received open-label enzalutamide. In P2, 271 patients were randomly assigned at 73 sites to receive enzalutamide (n=136) or placebo (n=135). The data cutoff for analysis was April 30, 2020. Median progression-free survival with enzalutamide was 9·5 months (95% CI 8·3-10·9) versus 8·3 months (6·3-8·7) with placebo (hazard ratio 0·72 [95% CI 0·53-0·96]; p=0·027). The most common grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (17 [13%] of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group vs 12 [9%] of 135 patients in the placebo group) and asthenia (ten [7%] vs six [4%]). The most common grade 4 treatment-emergent adverse event in P2 was neutropenia (23 [17%] of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group vs 28 [21%] of 135 patients in the placebo group). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 67 (49%) of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group and 52 (39%) of 135 patients in the placebo group. Two (15%) of 13 deaths in the enzalutamide group (caused by septic shock and haematuria) and one (14%) of seven deaths in the placebo group (caused by actue kidney injury) were associated with docetaxel.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      PRESIDE met its primary endpoint and showed that continuing enzalutamide with docetaxel plus androgen deprivation therapy delayed time to progression compared with docetaxel plus androgen deprivation therapy alone, supporting the hypothesis that enzalutamide maintenance could control persistent androgen-dependent clones in men with mCRPC who progress after treatment with enzalutamide alone.

A randomised-controlled trial (TARGET-C) of high vs. low target mean arterial pressure in patients with cirrhosis and septic shock.,"Rakhi Maiwall, Samba Siva Rao Pasupuleti, Ashini Kumar Hidam, Anupam Kumar, Harsh Vardhan Tevethia, Rajan Vijayaraghavan, Arpita Majumdar, Adarsh Prasher, Sherin Thomas, Rajendra Prasad Mathur, Guresh Kumar, Shiv Kumar Sarin, Rakhi Maiwallet al.",2023 Aug,J Hepatol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37088310/,No keywords found,"Background & aims:
        
      
      A high mean arterial pressure (MAP) target has been associated with improved renal outcomes in patients with cirrhosis, though it has not been studied in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and septic shock (CICs). We compared the efficacy of a high (80-85 mmHg; H-MAP) vs. low (60-65; L-MAP) target MAP strategy in improving 28-day mortality in CICs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed open-label 1:1 randomisation of 150 CICs (H-MAP 75; L-MAP 75). The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality and secondary endpoints included reversal of shock, acute kidney injury (AKI) at day 5, the incidence of intradialytic hypotension (IDH), and adverse events. Endothelial markers were analysed in a subset of patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The baseline characteristics were comparable. On intention-to-treat analysis, 28-day mortality (65% vs. 56%; p = 0.54), reversal of shock (47% vs. 53%; p = 0.41) and AKI development (45% vs. 31%;p = 0.06) were not different between the H-MAP and L-MAP groups, respectively. A lower incidence of IDH (12% vs. 48%; p <0.001) and higher adverse events necessitating protocol discontinuation (24% vs. 11%; p = 0.031) were noted in the H-MAP group. On per-protocol analysis (L-MAP 67; H-MAP 57), a significantly higher reversal of AKI (53% vs. 31%; p = 0.02) and a lower incidence of IDH (4% vs. 53%; p <0.001) were observed in the H-MAP group. Endothelial repair markers such as ADAMTS (2.11 ± 1.13 vs. 1.15 ± 0.48; p = 0.002) and angiopoietin-2 (74.08 ± 53.00 vs. 41.80 ± 15.95; p = 0.016) were higher in the H-MAP group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A higher MAP strategy does not confer a survival benefit in CICs, but improves tolerance to dialysis, lactate clearance and renal recovery. Higher adverse events indicate the need for better tools to evaluate target microcirculation pressures in CICs.
    


          Impact and implications:
        
      
      Maintaining an appropriate organ perfusion pressure during sepsis is the ultimate goal of haemodynamic management. A higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) improves renal outcomes in patients with hepatorenal syndrome. Patients with cirrhosis and septic shock have severe circulatory disturbances, low MAP, and poor tissue perfusion. In these patients, targeting higher MAP vs. lower MAP does not confer any survival benefit but is associated with more adverse events. A higher target strategy was associated with better tolerance and lesser episodes of hypotension on dialysis. Patients who could achieve the higher target MAP, without the development of adverse events, had improved renal outcomes and better lactate clearance. Higher MAP was also associated with improvements in markers of endothelial function. A higher target MAP strategy, with close monitoring of adverse events, may be recommended for patients with cirrhosis and septic shock.

      Six hundred fifty patients were treated and analyzed for safety; and 649 for efficacy data (ilofotase alfa n = 330; placebo n = 319). The observed mortality rates in the ilofotase alfa and placebo groups were 27.9% and 27.9% at 28 days, and 33.9% and 34.8% at 90 days. The trial was stopped for futility on the primary endpoint. The observed proportion of patients with MAKE90A and MAKE90B were 56.7% and 37.4% in the ilofotase alfa group vs. 64.6% and 42.8% in the placebo group.

Secondary endpoints were acute kidney injury (AKI), 30-day mortality, myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS), hospital length of stay, and rehospitalisation within 30 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 3626 patients were enrolled over 6 months; 1809 patients were randomised in the NE group, 1817 in the PE group. Overall, 88.2% received the assigned first-line vasopressor. No drug infiltrations requiring treatment were reported in either group. Patients were median 63 yr old, 50% female, and 58% white. Randomisation in the NE group vs PE group did not reduce readmission within 30 days (adjusted odds ratio=0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.39), 30-day mortality (1.01; 0.48-2.09), AKI (1.1; 0.92-1.31), or MINS (1.63; 0.84-3.16).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A large and diverse population undergoing major surgery under general anaesthesia was successfully enrolled and randomised to receive NE or PE infusion. This pilot and feasibility trial was not powered for adverse postoperative outcomes and a follow-up multicentre effectiveness trial is planned.

Effects of very early start of norepinephrine in patients with septic shock: a propensity score-based analysis.,"Gustavo A Ospina-Tascón, Glenn Hernandez, Ingrid Alvarez, Luis E Calderón-Tapia, Ramiro Manzano-Nunez, Alvaro I Sánchez-Ortiz, Egardo Quiñones, Juan E Ruiz-Yucuma, José L Aldana, Jean-Louis Teboul, Alexandre Biasi Cavalcanti, Daniel De Backer, Jan Bakker, Gustavo A Ospina-Tascónet al.",2020 Feb 14,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32059682/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Optimal timing for the start of vasopressors (VP) in septic shock has not been widely studied since it is assumed that fluids must be administered in advance. We sought to evaluate whether a very early start of VP, even without completing the initial fluid loading, might impact clinical outcomes in septic shock.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 337 patients with sepsis requiring VP support for at least 6 h were initially selected from a prospectively collected database in a 90-bed mixed-ICU during a 24-month period. They were classified into very-early (VE-VPs) or delayed vasopressor start (D-VPs) categories according to whether norepinephrine was initiated or not within/before the next hour of the first resuscitative fluid load. Then, VE-VPs (n = 93) patients were 1:1 propensity matched to D-VPs (n = 93) based on age; source of admission (emergency room, general wards, intensive care unit); chronic and acute comorbidities; and lactate, heart rate, systolic, and diastolic pressure at vasopressor start. A risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model was fitted to assess the association between VE-VPs and day 28 mortality. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed also including those patients requiring VP support for less than 6 h.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients subjected to VE-VPs received significantly less resuscitation fluids at vasopressor starting (0[0-510] vs. 1500[650-2300] mL, p < 0.001) and during the first 8 h of resuscitation (1100[500-1900] vs. 2600[1600-3800] mL, p < 0.001), with no significant increase in acute renal failure and/or renal replacement therapy requirements. VE-VPs was related with significant lower net fluid balances 8 and 24 h after VPs. VE-VPs was also associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to D-VPs (HR 0.31, CI95% 0.17-0.57, p < 0.001) at day 28. Such association was maintained after including patients receiving vasopressors for < 6 h.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A very early start of vasopressor support seems to be safe, might limit the amount of fluids to resuscitate septic shock, and could lead to better clinical outcomes."

      Mantle cell lymphoma is characterised by a poor long-term prognosis. The European Mantle Cell Lymphoma Network aimed to investigate whether the introduction of high-dose cytarabine to immunochemotherapy before autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) improves outcome.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 trial was done in 128 haemato-oncological hospital departments or private practices in Germany, France, Belgium, and Poland. Patients aged 65 years or younger with untreated stage II-IV mantle cell lymphoma were centrally randomised (1:1), with computer-assisted random block selection, to receive either six courses of R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) followed by myeloablative radiochemotherapy and ASCT (control group), or six courses of alternating R-CHOP or R-DHAP (rituximab plus dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin) followed by a high-dose cytarabine-containing conditioning regimen and ASCT (cytarabine group). Patients were stratified by study group and international prognostic index. The primary outcome was time to treatment failure from randomisation to stable disease after at least four induction cycles, progression, or death from any cause. Patients with stage II-IV mantle cell lymphoma were included in the primary analysis if treatment was started according to randomisation. For safety analyses, patients were assessed according to the treatment actually started. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00209222.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Of 497 patients (median age 55 years [IQR 49-60]) randomised from July 20, 2004, to March 18, 2010, 234 of 249 in the control group and 232 of 248 in the cytarabine group were included in the primary analysis. After a median follow-up of 6.1 years (95% CI 5.4-6.4), time to treatment failure was significantly longer in the cytarabine group (median 9.1 years [95% CI 6.3-not reached], 5 year rate 65% [95% CI 57-71]) than in the control group (3.9 years [3.2-4.4], 40% [33-46]; hazard ratio 0.56; p=0.038). During induction immunochemotherapy, patients who received high-dose cytarabine had increased grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (haemoglobin 71 [29%] of 241m vs 19 [8%] of 227 controls; platelets 176 [73%] of 240 vs 21 [9%] of 225), grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia (39 [17%] of 230 vs 19 [8%] of 224), and grade 1 or 2 renal toxicity (creatinine 102 [43%] of 236 vs 22 [10%] of 224). The number of ASCT-related deaths was similar (eight [3.4%]) in both groups.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Immunochemotherapy containing high-dose cytarabine followed by ASCT should be considered standard of care in patients aged 65 years or younger with mantle cell lymphoma.

      Severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (SAH) is associated with high 90-day mortality. Glucocorticoid therapy for 28 days improves 30- but not 90-day survival. We assessed the efficacy and safety of a combination of anakinra, an IL-1 antagonist, plus zinc (A+Z) compared to prednisone using the Day-7 Lille score as a stopping rule in patients with SAH.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this phase IIb double-blind randomized trial in adults with SAH and MELD scores of 20-35, participants were randomized to receive either daily anakinra 100 mg subcutaneously for 14 days plus daily zinc sulfate 220 mg orally for 90 days, or daily prednisone 40 mg orally for 30 days. Prednisone or prednisone placebo was stopped if Day-7 Lille score was >0.45. All study drugs were stopped for uncontrolled infection or ≥5 point increase in MELD score. The primary endpoint was overall survival at 90 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-three participants were randomized to prednisone and 74 to A+Z. The trial was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis showed prednisone was associated with higher 90-day overall survival (90% vs. 70%; hazard ratio for death = 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.83, p = 0.018) and transplant-free survival (88% vs. 64%; hazard ratio for transplant or death = 0.30, 95% CI 0.13-0.69, p = 0.004) than A+Z. Acute kidney injury was more frequent with A+Z (45%) than prednisone (22%) (p = 0.001), but rates of infection were similar (31% in A+Z vs. 27% in prednisone, p = 0.389).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Participants with SAH treated with prednisone using the Day-7 Lille score as a stopping rule had significantly higher overall and transplant-free 90-day survival and lower incidence of acute kidney injury than those treated with A+Z.
    


          Impact and implications:
        
      
      There is no approved treatment for severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (SAH). In this double-blind randomized trial, patients with SAH treated with prednisone using the Lille stopping rule on Day 7 had higher 90-day overall and transplant-free survival and lower rates of acute kidney injury compared to patients treated with a combination of anakinra and zinc. The data support continued use of glucocorticoids for patients with SAH, with treatment discontinuation for those with a Lille score >0.45 on Day 7.

"Fulvestrant plus capivasertib versus placebo after relapse or progression on an aromatase inhibitor in metastatic, oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (FAKTION): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial.","Robert H Jones, Angela Casbard, Margherita Carucci, Catrin Cox, Rachel Butler, Fouad Alchami, Tracie-Ann Madden, Catherine Bale, Pavel Bezecny, Johnathan Joffe, Sarah Moon, Chris Twelves, Ramachandran Venkitaraman, Simon Waters, Andrew Foxley, Sacha J Howell, Robert H Joneset al.",2020 Mar,Lancet Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32035020/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Capivasertib (AZD5363) is a potent selective oral inhibitor of all three isoforms of the serine/threonine kinase AKT. The FAKTION trial investigated whether the addition of capivasertib to fulvestrant improved progression-free survival in patients with aromatase inhibitor-resistant advanced breast cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, postmenopausal women aged at least 18 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 and oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic or locally advanced inoperable breast cancer who had relapsed or progressed on an aromatase inhibitor were recruited from 19 hospitals in the UK. Enrolled participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intramuscular fulvestrant 500 mg (day 1) every 28 days (plus a loading dose on day 15 of cycle 1) with either capivasertib 400 mg or matching placebo, orally twice daily on an intermittent weekly schedule of 4 days on and 3 days off (starting on cycle 1 day 15) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. Treatment allocation was done using an interactive web-response system using a minimisation method (with a 20% random element) and the following minimisation factors: measurable or non-measurable disease, primary or secondary aromatase inhibitor resistance, PIK3CA status, and PTEN status. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival with a one-sided alpha of 0·20. Analyses were done by intention to treat. Recruitment is complete, and the trial is in follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01992952.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between March 16, 2015, and March 6, 2018, 183 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 140 (76%) were eligible and were randomly assigned to receive fulvestrant plus capivasertib (n=69) or fulvestrant plus placebo (n=71). Median follow-up for progression-free survival was 4·9 months (IQR 1·6-11·6). At the time of primary analysis for progression-free survival (Jan 30, 2019), 112 progression-free survival events had occurred, 49 (71%) in 69 patients in the capivasertib group compared with 63 (89%) of 71 in the placebo group. Median progression-free survival was 10·3 months (95% CI 5·0-13·2) in the capivasertib group versus 4·8 months (3·1-7·7) in the placebo group, giving an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0·58 (95% CI 0·39-0·84) in favour of the capivasertib group (two-sided p=0·0044; one-sided log rank test p=0·0018). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (22 [32%] of 69 patients in the capivasertib group vs 17 [24%] of 71 in the placebo group), diarrhoea (ten [14%] vs three [4%]), rash (14 [20%] vs 0), infection (four [6%] vs two [3%]), and fatigue (one [1%] vs three [4%]). Serious adverse reactions occurred only in the capivasertib group, and were acute kidney injury (two), diarrhoea (three), rash (two), hyperglycaemia (one), loss of consciousness (one), sepsis (one), and vomiting (one). One death, due to atypical pulmonary infection, was assessed as possibly related to capivasertib treatment. One further death in the capivasertib group had an unknown cause; all remaining deaths in both groups (19 in the capivasertib group and 31 in the placebo group) were disease related.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Progression-free survival was significantly longer in participants who received capivasertib than in those who received placebo. The combination of capivasertib and fulvestrant warrants further investigation in phase 3 trials.

Effect of a Buffered Crystalloid Solution vs Saline on Acute Kidney Injury Among Patients in the Intensive Care Unit: The SPLIT Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Paul Young, Michael Bailey, Richard Beasley, Seton Henderson, Diane Mackle, Colin McArthur, Shay McGuinness, Jan Mehrtens, John Myburgh, Alex Psirides, Sumeet Reddy, Rinaldo Bellomo                              ;, SPLIT Investigators;, ANZICS CTG, Anna Hunt, Sally Hurford, Leanlove Navarra, Adelaide Jason-Smith, Lynn Andrews, Louise Hitchings, David Closey, Kim Parker, Emmeline Minto, Anna Morris, Rachael McConnochie, Yan Chen, Lynette Newby, Rachael Parke, Lianne McCarthy, Eileen Gilder, Andrea Lammert, Stephanie Long, Keri-Anne Cowdrey, Paul Younget al.",2015 Oct 27,JAMA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26444692/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is the most commonly administered intravenous fluid; however, its use may be associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and increased mortality.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine the effect of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline on renal complications in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
    


          Design and setting:
        
      
      Double-blind, cluster randomized, double-crossover trial conducted in 4 ICUs in New Zealand from April 2014 through October 2014. Three ICUs were general medical and surgical ICUs; 1 ICU had a predominance of cardiothoracic and vascular surgical patients.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      All patients admitted to the ICU requiring crystalloid fluid therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients with established AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. All 2278 eligible patients were enrolled; 1152 of 1162 patients (99.1%) receiving buffered crystalloid and 1110 of 1116 patients (99.5%) receiving saline were analyzed.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participating ICUs were assigned a masked study fluid, either saline or a buffered crystalloid, for alternating 7-week treatment blocks. Two ICUs commenced using 1 fluid and the other 2 commenced using the alternative fluid. Two crossovers occurred so that each ICU used each fluid twice over the 28 weeks of the study. The treating clinician determined the rate and frequency of fluid administration.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was proportion of patients with AKI (defined as a rise in serum creatinine level of at least 2-fold or a serum creatinine level of ≥3.96 mg/dL with an increase of ≥0.5 mg/dL); main secondary outcomes were incidence of RRT use and in-hospital mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the buffered crystalloid group, 102 of 1067 patients (9.6%) developed AKI within 90 days after enrollment compared with 94 of 1025 patients (9.2%) in the saline group (absolute difference, 0.4% [95% CI, -2.1% to 2.9%]; relative risk [RR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.36]; P = .77). In the buffered crystalloid group, RRT was used in 38 of 1152 patients (3.3%) compared with 38 of 1110 patients (3.4%) in the saline group (absolute difference, -0.1% [95% CI, -1.6% to 1.4%]; RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.50]; P = .91). Overall, 87 of 1152 patients (7.6%) in the buffered crystalloid group and 95 of 1110 patients (8.6%) in the saline group died in the hospital (absolute difference, -1.0% [95% CI, -3.3% to 1.2%]; RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.67 to 1.17]; P = .40).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients receiving crystalloid fluid therapy in the ICU, use of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline did not reduce the risk of AKI. Further large randomized clinical trials are needed to assess efficacy in higher-risk populations and to measure clinical outcomes such as mortality.

      Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and increased α-fetoprotein concentrations have poor prognosis. We aimed to establish the efficacy of ramucirumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or higher.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      REACH-2 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 92 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 20 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically or cytologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma, or diagnosed cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance statuses of 0 or 1, α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or greater, and had previously received first-line sorafenib. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive web response system with a computer-generated random sequence to 8 mg/kg intravenous ramucirumab every 2 weeks or placebo. All patients received best supportive care. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, proportion of patients achieving an objective response, time to radiographic progression, safety, time to deterioration in scores on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Hepatobiliary Symptom Index 8 (FHSI-8), and time to deterioration in ECOG performance status. We also pooled individual patient data from REACH-2 with data from REACH (NCT01140347) for patients with α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or greater. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, whereas safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02435433.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between July 26, 2015, and Aug 30, 2017, 292 patients were randomly assigned, 197 to the ramucirumab group and 95 to the placebo group. At a median follow-up of 7·6 months (IQR 4·0-12·5), median overall survival (8·5 months [95% CI 7·0-10·6] vs 7·3 months [5·4-9·1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·710 [95% CI 0·531-0·949]; p=0·0199) and progression-free survival (2·8 months [2·8-4·1] vs 1·6 months [1·5-2·7]; 0·452 [0·339-0·603]; p<0·0001) were significantly improved in the ramucirumab group compared with the placebo group. The proportion of patients with an objective response did not differ significantly between groups (nine [5%] of 197 vs one [1%] of 95; p=0·1697). Median time to deterioration in FHSI-8 total scores (3·7 months [95% CI 2·8-4·4] vs 2·8 months [1·6-2·9]; HR 0·799 [95% CI 0·545-1·171]; p=0·238) and ECOG performance statuses (HR 1·082 [95% CI 0·639-1·832]; p=0·77) did not differ between groups. Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either group were hypertension (25 [13%] in the ramucirumab group vs five [5%] in the placebo group), hyponatraemia (11 [6%] vs 0) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (six [3%] vs five [5%]). Serious adverse events of any grade and cause occurred in 68 (35%) patients in the ramucirumab group and 28 (29%) patients in the placebo group. Three patients in the ramucirumab group died from treatment-emergent adverse events that were judged to be related to study treatment (one had acute kidney injury, one had hepatorenal syndrome, and one had renal failure).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      REACH-2 met its primary endpoint, showing improved overall survival for ramucirumab compared with placebo in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and α-fetoprotein concentrations of at least 400 ng/mL who had previously received sorafenib. Ramucirumab was well tolerated, with a manageable safety profile. To our knowledge, REACH-2 is the first positive phase 3 trial done in a biomarker-selected patient population with hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Survival outcomes are poor for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who receive standard, first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy. We assessed the overall survival of patients who received durvalumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor), with or without tremelimumab (a CTLA-4 inhibitor), as a first-line treatment for metastatic urothelial carcinoma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      DANUBE is an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial in patients with untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, conducted at 224 academic research centres, hospitals, and oncology clinics in 23 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) to receive durvalumab monotherapy (1500 mg) administered intravenously every 4 weeks; durvalumab (1500 mg) plus tremelimumab (75 mg) administered intravenously every 4 weeks for up to four doses, followed by durvalumab maintenance (1500 mg) every 4 weeks; or standard-of-care chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin or gemcitabine plus carboplatin, depending on cisplatin eligibility) administered intravenously for up to six cycles. Randomisation was done through an interactive voice-web response system, with stratification by cisplatin eligibility, PD-L1 status, and presence or absence of liver metastases, lung metastases, or both. The coprimary endpoints were overall survival compared between the durvalumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy groups in the population of patients with high PD-L1 expression (the high PD-L1 population) and between the durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus chemotherapy groups in the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients). The study has completed enrolment and the final analysis of overall survival is reported. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02516241, and the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2015-001633-24.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Nov 24, 2015, and March 21, 2017, we randomly assigned 1032 patients to receive durvalumab (n=346), durvalumab plus tremelimumab (n=342), or chemotherapy (n=344). At data cutoff (Jan 27, 2020), median follow-up for survival was 41·2 months (IQR 37·9-43·2) for all patients. In the high PD-L1 population, median overall survival was 14·4 months (95% CI 10·4-17·3) in the durvalumab monotherapy group (n=209) versus 12·1 months (10·4-15·0) in the chemotherapy group (n=207; hazard ratio 0·89, 95% CI 0·71-1·11; p=0·30). In the intention-to-treat population, median overall survival was 15·1 months (13·1-18·0) in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group versus 12·1 months (10·9-14·0) in the chemotherapy group (0·85, 95% CI 0·72-1·02; p=0·075). In the safety population, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 47 (14%) of 345 patients in the durvalumab group, 93 (27%) of 340 patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group, and in 188 (60%) of 313 patients in the chemotherapy group. The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse event was increased lipase in the durvalumab group (seven [2%] of 345 patients) and in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group (16 [5%] of 340 patients), and neutropenia in the chemotherapy group (66 [21%] of 313 patients). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 30 (9%) of 345 patients in the durvalumab group, 78 (23%) of 340 patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group, and 50 (16%) of 313 patients in the chemotherapy group. Deaths due to study drug toxicity were reported in two (1%) patients in the durvalumab group (acute hepatic failure and hepatitis), two (1%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group (septic shock and pneumonitis), and one (<1%) patient in the chemotherapy group (acute kidney injury).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      This study did not meet either of its coprimary endpoints. Further research to identify the patients with previously untreated metastatic urothelial carcinoma who benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination regimens, is warranted.

Effect of High-Cutoff Hemodialysis vs Conventional Hemodialysis on Hemodialysis Independence Among Patients With Myeloma Cast Nephropathy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Frank Bridoux, Pierre-Louis Carron, Brigitte Pegourie, Eric Alamartine, Karine Augeul-Meunier, Alexandre Karras, Bertrand Joly, Marie-Noëlle Peraldi, Bertrand Arnulf, Cécile Vigneau, Thierry Lamy, Alain Wynckel, Brigitte Kolb, Bruno Royer, Nolwenn Rabot, Lotfi Benboubker, Christian Combe, Arnaud Jaccard, Bruno Moulin, Bertrand Knebelmann, Sylvie Chevret, Jean-Paul Fermand                              ;, MYRE Study Group, Frank Bridouxet al.",2017 Dec 5,JAMA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29209721/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Cast nephropathy is the main cause of acute kidney injury in multiple myeloma and persistent reduction in kidney function strongly affects prognosis. Strategies to rapidly remove nephrotoxic serum-free light chains combined with novel antimyeloma agents have not been evaluated prospectively.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare the hemodialysis independence rate among patients newly diagnosed with myeloma cast nephropathy treated with hemodialysis using a high-cutoff dialyzer (with very large membrane pores and high permeability to immunoglobulin light chains) or a conventional high-flux dialyzer (with small pores and lower permeability).
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Randomized clinical trial involving 98 patients with biopsy-proven myeloma cast nephropathy requiring hemodialysis treated at 48 French centers between July 2011 and June 2016; the final date of follow-up was June 29, 2016.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Intensive hemodialysis (eight 5-hour sessions over 10 days) with either a high-cutoff dialyzer (46 patients) or a conventional high-flux dialyzer (48 patients). All patients received the same chemotherapy regimen of bortezomib and dexamethasone.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Primary end point was hemodialysis independence at 3 months; secondary end points: hemodialysis independence rates at 6 and 12 months, hemodialysis- and chemotherapy-related adverse events, and death.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 98 randomized patients, 94 (96%) (median age, 68.8 years [interquartile range, 61.2-75.3 years]; 45% women) were included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis. The hemodialysis independence rate at 3 months was 41.3% (n = 19) in the high-cutoff hemodialysis group vs 33.3% (n = 16) in the conventional hemodialysis group (between-group difference, 8.0% [95% CI, -12.0% to 27.9%], P = .42); at 6 months, the rate was 56.5% (n = 26) vs 35.4% (n = 17), respectively (between-group difference, 21.1% [95% CI, 0.9% to 41.3%], P = .04); and at 12 months, the rate was 60.9% (n = 28) vs 37.5% (n = 18) (between-group difference, 23.4% [95% CI, 3.2% to 43.5%], P = .02). The incidence of hemodialysis-related adverse events was 43% in the high-cutoff hemodialysis group vs 39% in the conventional hemodialysis group; chemotherapy-related serious adverse events, 39% vs 37%, respectively; and at 12 months, 9 patients vs 10 patients died.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients with myeloma cast nephropathy treated with a bortezomib-based chemotherapy regimen, the use of high-cutoff hemodialysis compared with conventional hemodialysis did not result in a statistically significant difference in hemodialysis independence at 3 months. However, the study may have been underpowered to identify an early clinically important difference.

Patients were randomized to a main group (standard therapy supplemented with dapagliflozin) or a control group (standard therapy for ADHF). The primary endpoint was the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). 200 patients were included (mean age, 74±12 years; 51% men). 31% of patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) was 47±14 %; in 44.5% of patients, LV EF was less than 45%. Median concentration of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 5225 [3120; 9743] pg / ml, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 51 [38; 64] ml / min / 1.73 m2.Results In-hospital mortality was 6.5%. Analysis of the dynamics of body weight loss showed significant differences (4200 [2925; 6300] g vs. 3000 [1113; 4850] g; p=0.011) in favor of the dapagliflozin group. The requirement for increasing the daily dose of furosemide and adding an another class diuretic (thiazide or acetazolamide) did not differ between the groups. However, median furosemide dose during the stay in the hospital was lower in the dapagliflozin group (80 [67; 120] mg vs. 102 [43; 120] mg; p=0.016). At 48 hours after randomization, GFR significantly decreased in the dapagliflozin group (-5.5 [-11; 3] ml/min/ 1.73 m2) compared to the control group (-0.3 [-4; 5] ml / min/1.73 m2, р=0.012). Despite this, GFR did not differ between the groups at discharge (51 [41; 66] ml/min/1.73 m2 and 49 [38; 67] ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively; p = 0.84). In the dapagliflozin group, frequency of AKI episodes was not increased compared to the control group (13 and 9.4%, respectively; p = 0.45).Conclusion The dapagliflozin treatment in ADHF is associated with more pronounced body weight loss and lower average doses of loop diuretics during the period of stay in the hospital, with no associated clinically significant impairment of renal function."

      During acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis, the intestinal microbiota changes to dysbiosis, which affects the kidney function recovery (KFR) and amplifies the injury. Therefore, the administration of probiotics could improve dysbiosis and thereby increase the probability of KFR.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this double-blind clinical trial, patients with AKI associated with sepsis were randomized (1:1) to receive probiotics or placebo for 7 consecutive days, with the objectives of evaluate the effect on KFR, mortality, kidney replacement therapy (KRT), urea, urine volume, serum electrolytes and adverse events at day 7.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From February 2019 to March 2022, a total of 92 patients were randomized, 48 to the Probiotic and 44 to Placebo group. When comparing with placebo, those in the Probiotics did not observe a higher KFR (HR 0.93, 0.52-1.68, p = 0.81), nor was there a benefit in mortality at 6 months (95% CI 0.32-1.04, p = 0.06). With probiotics, urea values decreased significantly, an event not observed with placebo (from 154 to 80 mg/dl, p = 0.04 and from 130 to 109 mg/dl, p = 0.09, respectively). Urinary volume, need for KRT, electrolyte abnormalities, and adverse events were similar between groups. (ClinicalTrial.gov NCT03877081) (registered 03/15/2019).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In AKI related to sepsis, probiotics for 7 consecutive days did not increase the probability of KFR, nor did other variables related to clinical improvement, although they were safe."
"The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of avasopasem manganese in age-associated, cisplatin-induced renal injury.","Kranti A Mapuskar, Casey F Pulliam, Ann Tomanek-Chalkley, Prerna Rastogi, Hsiang Wen, Sanjana Dayal, Benjamin R Griffin, Diana Zepeda-Orozco, Amy L Sindler, Carryn M Anderson, Robert Beardsley, Eugene P Kennedy, Douglas R Spitz, Bryan G Allen, Kranti A Mapuskaret al.",2024 Apr:70:103022.,Redox Biol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38215546/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Cisplatin contributes to acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) that occurs with greater frequency and severity in older patients. Age-associated cisplatin sensitivity in human fibroblasts involves increased mitochondrial superoxide produced by older donor cells.
    


          Experimental design:
        
      
      Young and old C57BL/6 J murine models of cisplatin-induced AKI and CKD were treated with the SOD mimetic avasopasem manganese to investigate the potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Adverse event reporting from a phase 2 and a phase 3 randomized clinical trial (NCT02508389 and NCT03689712) conducted in patients treated with cisplatin and AVA was determined to have established the incidence and severity of AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Cisplatin-induced AKI and CKD occurred in all mice, however, was more pronounced in older mice. AVA reduced cisplatin-induced mortality, AKI, and CKD, in older animals. AVA also alleviated cisplatin-induced alterations in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex activities and NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4) and inhibited the increased levels of the inflammation markers, TNFα, IL1, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. Analysis of age-stratified subjects treated with cisplatin from clinical trials (NCT02508389, NCT03689712) also supported that the incidence of AKI increased with age and AVA reduced age-associated therapy-induced adverse events (AE), including hypomagnesemia, increased creatinine, and AKI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Older mice and humans are more susceptible to cisplatin-induced kidney injury, and treatment with AVA mitigates age-associated damage. Mitochondrial ETC and NOX4 activities represent sources of superoxide production contributing to cisplatin-induced kidney injury, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production and endothelial dysfunction may also be increased by superoxide formation."
"Cisplatin with veliparib or placebo in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer (S1416): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.","Eve Rodler, Priyanka Sharma, William E Barlow, Julie R Gralow, Shannon L Puhalla, Carey K Anders, Lori Goldstein, Debu Tripathy, Ursa A Brown-Glaberman, Thu-Tam Huynh, Christopher S Szyarto, Andrew K Godwin, Harsh B Pathak, Elizabeth M Swisher, Marc R Radke, Kirsten M Timms, Danika L Lew, Jieling Miao, Lajos Pusztai, Daniel F Hayes, Gabriel N Hortobagyi, Eve Rodleret al.",2023 Feb,Lancet Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36623515/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are effective in germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation-associated metastatic breast cancer. However, studies evaluating PARP inhibitors plus platinum-based chemotherapy in germline BRCA1/2-wildtype triple-negative breast cancer are scarce. A large proportion of germline BRCA1/2-wildtype triple-negative breast cancer shows homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), resulting in a BRCA-like phenotype that might render sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. The S1416 trial assessed the efficacy of cisplatin combined with the PARP inhibitor veliparib in three predefined groups of metastatic breast cancer: germline BRCA1/2-mutated, BRCA-like, and non-BRCA-like.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      S1416 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial conducted at 154 community and academic clinical sites across the USA. Eligible patients aged 18 years or older had metastatic or recurrent triple-negative breast cancer or germline BRCA1/2-associated metastatic or recurrent breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had received up to one line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via the National Clinical Trials Network open interactive system with dynamic balancing on number of previous cytotoxic regimens for metastatic disease to receive intravenous cisplatin (75 mg/m2, day 1) combined with either veliparib or matching placebo (300 mg orally twice a day, days 1-14) on a 21-day cycle. Investigators, patients, and the sponsors were masked to treatment assignment; the study statisticians were unmasked. Central testing after ran domisation classified patients as having mutated or wildtype germline BRCA1/2. A biomarker panel established a priori was used to classify patients with wildtype germline BRCA1/2 into BRCA-like and non-BRCA-like phenotype groups, with BRCA-like status based on at least one of the biomarkers: genomic instability score (≥42), somatic BRCA1/2 mutations, BRCA1 promoter methylation, or non-BRCA1/2 homologous recombination repair germline mutations. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival, analysed separately for the three predefined biomarker groups with a prespecified α value for each analysis. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat and included all eligible patients. Safety analyses of toxicities attributed to treatment included all patients who received at least one dose of veliparib or placebo. The study is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02595905.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between July 7, 2016, and June 15, 2019, 335 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. 320 patients (n=162 to cisplatin plus veliparib, all women; and n=158 to cisplatin plus placebo, 157 women and one man) were eligible for efficacy evaluation. 247 patients were classified into the three biomarker groups: germline BRCA1/2-mutated (n=37), BRCA-like (n=101), and non-BRCA-like (n=109). 73 patients could not be classified due to missing biomarker information. Median follow-up was 11·1 months (IQR 5·6-20·8). In the germline BRCA1/2-mutated group, median progression-free survival was 6·2 months (95% CI 2·3-9·2) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group and 6·4 months (4·3-8·2) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·79 [95% CI 0·38-1·67]; log-rank p=0·54). In the BRCA-like group, median progression-free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 4·3-7·8) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group versus 4·2 months (2·3-5·0) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·57 [95% CI 0·37-0·88]; p=0·010). In the non-BRCA-like group, median progression-free survival was 4·0 months (95% CI 2·5-4·7) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group versus 3·0 months (2·2-4·4) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·60-1·33]; p=0·57). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events attributed to treatment were neutropenia (71 [46%] of 155 patients in the cisplatin plus veliparib group vs 29 [20%] of 147 in the cisplatin plus placebo group), leukopenia (42 [27%] vs 11 [7%]), anaemia (35 [23%] vs 12 [8%]), and thrombocytopenia (29 [19%] vs four [3%]). Serious adverse events attributed to treatment occurred in 48 (31%) patients in the cisplatin plus veliparib group and 53 (36%) patients in the cisplatin plus placebo group. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in one patient in the cisplatin plus veliparib group (sepsis) and one patient in the cisplatin plus placebo group (acute kidney injury due to cisplatin plus heart failure from previous doxorubicin exposure).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      The addition of veliparib to cisplatin significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with BRCA-like metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, but not in patients with non-BRCA-like metastatic breast cancer. PARP inhibitors combined with platinum-based chemotherapy should be explored further in BRCA-like triple-negative breast cancer.

The Relationship between Rate and Volume of Intravenous Fluid Administration and Kidney Outcomes after Angiography.,"Qandeel H Soomro, Sonia T Anand, Steven D Weisbord, Martin P Gallagher, Ryan E Ferguson, Paul M Palevsky, Deepak L Bhatt, Chirag R Parikh, James S Kaufman                                                            ;, PRESERVE Trial Investigators;, PRESERVE Trial Group, Qandeel H Soomroet al.",2022 Oct,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36008352/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Contrast-associated AKI may result in higher morbidity and mortality. Intravenous fluid administration remains the mainstay for prevention. There is a lack of consensus on the optimal administration strategy. We studied the association of periprocedure fluid administration with contrast-associated AKI, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 25% or 0.5 mg/dl from baseline at 3-5 days after angiography, and 90-day need for dialysis, death, or a 50% increase in serum creatinine.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      We conducted a secondary analysis of 4671 PRESERVE participants who underwent angiographic procedures. Although fluid type was randomized, strategy of administration was at the discretion of the clinician. We divided the study cohort into quartiles by total fluid volume. We performed multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for clinically important covariates. We tested for the interaction between fluid volume and duration of fluid administration, categorized as <6 or ≥6 hours.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean (SD) age was 70 (8) years, 94% of participants were male, and median (interquartile range) eGFR was 60 (41-60) ml/min per 1.73 m2. The range of fluid administered was 89-882 ml in quartile 1 and 1258-2790 ml in quartile 4. Compared with the highest quartile (quartile 4) of fluid volume, we found a significantly higher risk of the primary outcome in quartile 1 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 2.38) but not in quartiles 2 and 3 compared with quartile 4. There was no difference in the incidence of contrast-associated AKI across the quartiles. The interaction between volume and duration was not significant for any of the outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We found that administration of a total volume of 1000 ml, starting at least 1 hour before contrast injection and continuing postcontrast for a total of 6 hours, is associated with a similar risk of adverse outcomes as larger volumes of intravenous fluids administered for periods >6 hours. Mean fluid volumes <964 ml may be associated with a higher risk for the primary outcome, although residual confounding cannot be excluded."
The use of Dapagliflozin in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure: Results of the Randomized Study.,"K V Charaya, D Itri Yu Schekochikhin, T V Nikiforova, A S Dimchishina, T V Soboleva, A M Shkliarov, Z R Kusova, D F Mesitskaya, N A Novikova, D A Andreev, K V Charayaet al.",2023 Aug 31,Kardiologiia,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37691500/,No keywords found,"Aim To determine the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on kidney function in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).Material and methods A controlled randomized study on the dapagliflozin treatment in ADHF was performed. Patients were randomized to a main group (standard therapy supplemented with dapagliflozin) or a control group (standard therapy for ADHF). The primary endpoint was the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). 200 patients were included (mean age, 74±12 years; 51% men). 31% of patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) was 47±14 %; in 44.5% of patients, LV EF was less than 45%. Median concentration of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 5225 [3120; 9743] pg / ml, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 51 [38; 64] ml / min / 1.73 m2.Results In-hospital mortality was 6.5%. Analysis of the dynamics of body weight loss showed significant differences (4200 [2925; 6300] g vs. 3000 [1113; 4850] g; p=0.011) in favor of the dapagliflozin group. The requirement for increasing the daily dose of furosemide and adding an another class diuretic (thiazide or acetazolamide) did not differ between the groups. However, median furosemide dose during the stay in the hospital was lower in the dapagliflozin group (80 [67; 120] mg vs. 102 [43; 120] mg; p=0.016). At 48 hours after randomization, GFR significantly decreased in the dapagliflozin group (-5.5 [-11; 3] ml/min/ 1.73 m2) compared to the control group (-0.3 [-4; 5] ml / min/1.73 m2, р=0.012). Despite this, GFR did not differ between the groups at discharge (51 [41; 66] ml/min/1.73 m2 and 49 [38; 67] ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively; p = 0.84). In the dapagliflozin group, frequency of AKI episodes was not increased compared to the control group (13 and 9.4%, respectively; p = 0.45).Conclusion The dapagliflozin treatment in ADHF is associated with more pronounced body weight loss and lower average doses of loop diuretics during the period of stay in the hospital, with no associated clinically significant impairment of renal function."

      This is a post hoc analysis of combined cohorts from two previous Phase II clinical trials to assess the effect of thiamine administration on kidney protection and mortality in patients with septic shock.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patient-level data from the Thiamine in Septic Shock Trial (NCT01070810) and the Thiamine for Renal Protection in Septic Shock Trial (NCT03550794) were combined in this analysis. The primary outcome for the current study was survival without the receipt of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Analyses were performed on the overall cohort and the thiamine-deficient cohort (thiamine < 8 nmol/L).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Totally, 158 patients were included. Overall, thiamine administration was associated with higher odds of being alive and RRT-free (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-3.90]) and not needing RRT (aOR: 2.59 [95% CI 1.01-6.62]). In the thiamine-deficient group, thiamine administration was associated with higher odds of being alive and RRT-free (aOR: 8.17 [95% CI 1.79-37.22]) and surviving to hospital discharge (aOR: 6.84 [95% CI 1.54-30.36]). There was a significant effect modification by baseline thiamine deficiency for alive and RRT-free (interaction, p = 0.016) and surviving to hospital discharge (p = 0.019).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In the combined analysis of two previous randomized trials, thiamine administration was associated with higher odds of being alive and RRT-free at hospital discharge in patients with septic shock. This signal was stronger in patients with thiamine deficiency."
A Phase III open-label randomized study to compare the efficacy of lenalidomide-rituximab with bendamustine-rituximab in treatment-naïve follicular lymphoma.,"Sushant Kumar Paikaray, Ajay Gogia, Lalit Kumar, Atul Sharma, Ahit Agni Biswas, Sreeniwas Vishnubhatla, Soumya Mallick, Sushant Kumar Paikarayet al.",2023 Oct 1,Indian J Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38185869/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Bendamustine-rituximab (BR) is the preferred regimen for the treatment of naïve follicular lymphoma (FL). Recently, lenalidomide-rituximab (LR), a chemotherapy-free protocol, has shown a good response rate in advanced FL. These regimens have never been compared in a randomized controlled trial for treatment-naïve FL in Indian patients.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This Phase III open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of BR and LR. Treatment-naïve patients older than 18 years of age, ECOG PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status) ≤2, who were diagnosed with FL (Stages II-IV) were included in this study. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive six cycles of BR (bendamustine 90 mg/m 2 Days 1-2 and rituximab 375 mg/m 2 Day 1) every 4 weeks or LR (lenalidomide 20 mg Days 1-21 and rituximab 375 mg/m 2 ) every 4 weeks. The primary end point was complete response (CR) and secondary end points were overall response rate (ORR) and toxicity.
    


          Result:
        
      
      We enrolled 40 patients, 20 in each group with a median age of 53 years. The CR rate was 60% and 20% in BR and LR arms, respectively ( P = 0.01); however, the ORR was 88.8% and 87.3% in BR and LR arms, respectively ( P = 1.0). Anemia (35% versus 10%), skin rash (35% versus 30%), diarrhea (30% versus 10%), vomiting (20% versus 10%), nephrotoxicity (15% versus 0%), and transaminitis (10% versus 0%) were more in LR than in BR, and thrombocytopenia was higher in the BR than in the LR group but statistically not different. All grade toxicities were seen in 90% and 45% in LR and BR, respectively ( P = 0.05), but there was no significant difference in Grade 3 or 4 toxicity between the BR and the LR regimens (20% versus 25%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The ORR was similar in both the arms; however, the CR rate was significantly higher in the BR arm. BR was better tolerated than LR.(CTRI/2016/05/006904)."

However, the effect of RAS and NSS on sepsis patient outcomes remains unknown. Methods: We conducted a single-center prospective open-label parallel controlled trial to enroll adult patients (>18 years old) diagnosed with sepsis. Participants received either RAS or NSS for intravenous infusion for 5 days. The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse kidney events within 28 days (MAKE28). Secondary outcomes included 30-/90-day mortality, acute kidney injury, and hyperchloremia. The patients were then reclassified as NSS-only, RAS-only, and RAS + NSS groups according to the type of fluid they had received before enrollment. Thereafter, a secondary post hoc analysis was performed. Results: Two hundred fifty-five septic patients were screened, and 143 patients (51.0% in RAS group and 49.0% in NSS group) were enrolled in the study. Each group received a median of 2 L of fluid administration during five interventional days. Of the patients, 39.3% had received 500 mL (500-1,000 mL) of balanced salt solutions (BSSs) before intensive care unit (ICU) admission. There was no statistical difference among the RAS and NSS group on the primary outcome MAKE28 in the initial analysis (23.3% vs. 20.0%; OR, 1.2 [0.6 to 2.2]; P = 0.69). MAKE28 was observed in 23.3% of RAS-only versus 27.3% of NSS-only group patients (0.82 [0.35-1.94], P = 0.65) in the secondary post hoc analysis. The patients in the NSS-only group had a longer invasive mechanical ventilation days and a trend toward the accumulation of serum chloride. Conclusion: This study observed no statistically significant difference on MAKE28 and secondary outcomes among sepsis patients receiving RAS and NSS. However, it is unclear whether the large amount of fluid resuscitation before ICU admission and carrier NSS narrowed the difference between BSSs and NSSs."
Empagliflozin reduces markers of acute kidney injury in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.,"Kirsten Thiele, Matthias Rau, Niels-Ulrik Korbinian Hartmann, Marcus Möller, Julia Möllmann, Joachim Jankowski, András P Keszei, Michael Böhm, Jürgen Floege, Nikolaus Marx, Michael Lehrke, Kirsten Thieleet al.",2022 Aug,ESC Heart Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35611683/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      In this prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, exploratory study, we examined early and more delayed effects of empagliflozin treatment on haemodynamic parameters (primary endpoint: cardiac output) and kidney function including parameters of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (HF).
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Patients with acute decompensated HF with or without diabetes were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg or placebo for 30 days. Haemodynamic, laboratory, and urinary parameters were assessed after 6 h, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 30 days of treatment. Median time between hospital admission and randomization was 72 h. Baseline characteristics were not different in the empagliflozin (n = 10) and placebo (n = 9) groups. Empagliflozin led to a significant increase in urinary glucose excretion throughout the study (baseline: 37 ± 15 mg/24 h; Day 1: 14 565 ± 8663 mg/24 h; P = 0.001). Empagliflozin did not affect the primary endpoint of cardiac index or on systemic vascular resistance index at any time point. However, empagliflozin significantly reduced parameters of AKI (urinary TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 by NephroCheck® as indicators of tubular kidney damage), which became significant after 3 days of treatment [placebo: 1.1 ± 1.1 (ng/mL)2 /1000; empagliflozin: 0.3 ± 0.2 (ng/mL)2 /1000; P = 0.02] and remained significant at the 7 day time point [placebo: 2.5 ± 3.8 (ng/mL)2 /1000; empagliflozin: 0.3 ± 0.2 (ng/mL)2 /1000; P = 0.003].
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this study, empagliflozin treatment did not affect haemodynamic parameters but significantly reduced markers of tubular injury in patients with acute decompensated HF."

          Methods and results:
        
      
      A total of 109 eligible septic shock patients in the intensive care unit were randomly divided into a control group (n = 55) and an intervention group (n = 54). The control group received normal saline, and the intervention group received low-dose furosemide (0.048 mg/kg.h-1) with aminophylline (0.3 mg/kg.h-1). The primary outcomes included the levels of serum creatinine (Scr), creatinine clearance rate (Ccr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urine output on admission and on days 3, 7 and 14. The secondary outcomes were the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) time and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, hospital mortality and 28-day mortality. There were no significant differences in the levels of Scr, Ccr, BUN, or GFR between the two groups, while the urine output was higher in the intervention group on days 3, 7, and 14. Compared with the control group, the SOFA scores, ICU mortality, hospital mortality and 28-day mortality were significantly lower in the intervention group on days 3, 7, and 14, the CRRT time was shorter, and the cumulative fluid balance was lower on days 3 and 7 in the intervention group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although low-dose furosemide and aminophylline have fewer protective effects on the renal function in septic shock patients, they could reduce the CRRT time and improve the prognosis."
Is the combination of linagliptin and allopurinol better prophylaxis against post-contrast acute kidney injury? A multicenter prospective randomized controlled study.,"Ahmed Fayed, Ahmed A Hammad, Dina O Abdulazim, Hany Hammad, Mohamed Amin, Samir Elhadidy, Mona M Salem, Ibrahim M Abd ElAzim, Lajos Zsom, Eva Csongradi, Karim M Soliman, Usama A Sharaf El Din, Ahmed Fayedet al.",2023 Dec,Ren Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36974638/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) are at increased risk to develop post-contrast acute kidney injury (AKI). Diabetic patients under dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4Is) experience a lower propensity to develop AKI. We speculated that linagliptin as a single agent or in combination with allopurinol may reduce the incidence of post-contrast AKI in stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with underlying DKD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Out of 951 DKD patients eligible for this study, 800 accepted to sign informed consent. They were randomly allocated to 4 equal groups that received their prophylaxis for 2 days before and after radiocontrast. The first control group received N-acetyl cysteine and saline, the 2nd received allopurinol, the 3rd group received linagliptin, and the 4th received both allopurinol and linagliptin. Post-procedure follow-up for kidney functions was conducted for 2 weeks in all patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      20, 19, 14, and 8 patients developed post-contrast AKI in groups 1 through 4, respectively. Neither linagliptin nor allopurinol was superior to N-acetyl cysteine and saline alone. However, the combination of the two agents provided statistically significant renal protection: post-contrast AKI in group 4 was significantly lower than in groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.02 and <0.03, respectively). None of the post-contrast AKI cases required dialysis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Linagliptin and allopurinol in combination may offer protection against post-contrast AKI in DKD exposed to radiocontrast. Further studies are needed to support this view.

Liver-HERO: hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) treatment with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in patients with cirrhosis-a randomized controlled trial.,"Cristina Ripoll, Stephanie Platzer, Philipp Franken, Rene Aschenbach, Andreas Wienke, Ulrike Schuhmacher, Ulf Teichgräber, Andreas Stallmach, Jörg Steighardt, Alexander Zipprich                              ;, Liver-HERO Study Group, Philipp Reuken, Marina Reljic, Florian Bürckenmeyer, Kathleen Lange, Robin Greinert, Marco Damm, Christian Lange, Paul Jamme, Max Seidensticker, Moritz Wildgruber, Dominik Bettinger, Michael Schultheiss, Marco Berning, Stefan Sulk, Jens-Peter Kühn, Ralf-Thorsten Hoffmann, Christoph Radosa, Thomas Hofmockel, Tony Bruns, Theresa Wirtz, Philipp Bruners, Karel Caca, Andreas Wannhoff, Benjamin Massoumy, Katja Deterding, Jan Hinrichs, Kerstin Port, Jonel Trebicka, Michael Praktiknjo, Cornelius Engelmann, Andreas Drolz, Cristina Ripollet al.",2023 Apr 5,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020315/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with cirrhosis and ascites (and portal hypertension) are at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Although many etiologies exist, hepatorenal AKI (HRS-AKI) remains a frequent and difficult-to-treat cause, with a very high mortality when left untreated. The standard of care is the use of terlipressin and albumin. This can lead to reversal of AKI, which is associated to survival. Nevertheless, only approximately half of the patients achieve this reversal and even after reversal patients remains at risk for new episodes of HRS-AKI. TIPS is accepted for use in patients with variceal bleeding and refractory ascites, which leads to a reduction in portal pressure. Although preliminary data suggest it may be useful in HRS-AKI, its use in this setting is controversial and caution is recommended given the fact that HRS-AKI is associated to cardiac alterations and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) which represent relative contraindications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). In the last decades, with the new definition of renal failure in patients with cirrhosis, patients are identified at an earlier stage. These patients are less sick and therefore more likely to not have contraindications for TIPS. We hypothesize that TIPS could be superior to the standard of care in patients with HRS-AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, open, 1:1-randomized, controlled parallel-group trial. The main end-point is to compare the 12-month liver transplant-free survival in patients assigned to TIPS compared to the standard of care (terlipressin and albumin). Secondary end-point include reversal of HRS-AKI, health-related Quality of Life (HrQoL), and incidence of further decompensation among others. Once patients are diagnosed with HRS-AKI, they will be randomized to TIPS or Standard of Care (SOC). TIPS should be placed within 72 h. Until TIPS placement, TIPS patients will be treated with terlipressin and albumin. Once TIPS is placed, terlipressin and albumin should be weaned off according to the attending physician.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      If the trial were to show a survival advantage for patients who undergo TIPS placement, this could be incorporated in routine clinical practice in the management of patients with HRS-AKI.

This study addresses the insufficient evidence on nephroprotective intraoperative fluid resuscitation and highlights the drawbacks of relying solely on serum creatinine/urine output to monitor kidney function. This study assessed the impact of intraoperative fluid management on AKI in female breast cancer patients undergoing autologous breast reconstruction, utilizing novel urinary biomarkers (TIMP-2 and IGFBP-7). In a monocentric prospective randomized controlled trial involving 40 patients, liberal (LFA) and restrictive (FRV) fluid management strategies were compared. TIMP-2 and IGFBP-7 biomarker levels were assessed using the NephroCheck (bioMerieux, France) test kit at preoperative, immediate postoperative, and 24-h postoperative stages. FRV showed significantly higher immediate postoperative biomarker levels, indicating renal tubular stress. FRV patients had 21% (4/19) experiencing AKI compared to 13% (2/15) in the LFA group according to KDIGO criteria (p = 0.385). Restrictive fluid resuscitation increases the risk of AKI in surgical patients significantly, emphasizing the necessity for individualized hemodynamic management. The findings underscore the importance of urinary biomarkers in early AKI detection."
Severe Acute Kidney Injury and Mortality in Extremely Low Gestational Age Neonates.,"Sangeeta Hingorani, Robert H Schmicker, Patrick D Brophy, Patrick J Heagerty, Sandra E Juul, Stuart L Goldstein, David Askenazi                              ;, PENUT Investigators, Sangeeta Hingoraniet al.",2021 Jun,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34117080/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      AKI is associated with poor short- and long-term outcomes. Questions remain about the frequency and timing of AKI, and whether AKI is a cause of death in extremely low gestational age neonates.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      The Recombinant Erythropoietin for Protection of Infant Kidney Disease Study examines the kidney outcomes of extremely low gestational age neonates enrolled in the Preterm Epo Neuroprotection study, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant human erythropoietin. We included 900 of 941 patients enrolled in Preterm Epo Neuroprotection. Baseline characteristics were compared by primary exposure (severe AKI versus none/stage 1 AKI) using unadjusted logistic regression models. Cox regression models estimated the relationship between severe AKI and death after adjustment for potential confounders. Time-dependent AKI was modeled as a binary outcome and a categorical variable by stage of AKI. We fit Cox models using time-dependent AKI status lagged by <7 days before death. Landmark analyses examined the relationship of death with development of severe AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Severe AKI occurred in 168 of 900 (19%, 95% confidence interval, 17% to 20%) neonates, and stage 3 AKI occurred in 60 (7%, 95% confidence interval, 5% to 8%). Stage 3 AKI occurring 7 days before death (hazard ratio, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.26 to 11.96), intraventricular hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 3.99) and sepsis (hazard ratio, 2.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 7.22) were all independently associated with death. Severe AKI occurring 7 days before death (hazard ratio, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 5.26) was associated with death but not statistically significant. In a landmark analysis, after adjusting for potential confounders, late (after day 14 and before day 28) severe AKI was strongly associated with higher hazard of death (hazard ratio, 4.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.82 to 11.5).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Severe AKI occurs frequently in extremely low gestational age neonates. Stage 3 AKI is associated with mortality, and this association is present 7 days before death."
Effect of a Combined Drug Approach on the Severity of Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury During Liver Transplant: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Nicolas Meurisse, Markoen Mertens, Steffen Fieuws, Nicholas Gilbo, Ina Jochmans, Jacques Pirenne, Diethard Monbaliu, Nicolas Meurisseet al.",2023 Feb 1,JAMA Netw Open,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36853611/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      In a porcine model of liver transplant, a combined drug approach that targeted the donor graft and graft recipient reduced ischemia-reperfusion injury, a major hurdle to the success of liver transplant.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess the effect of a clinical form of a perioperative combined drug approach delivered immediately before implantation to the procured liver and to the liver recipient on the degree of ischemia-reperfusion injury.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This unicentric, investigator-driven, open-label randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel arms was conducted in Belgium from September 2013 through February 2018, with 1-year follow-up. Adults wait-listed for a first solitary full-size liver transplant were screened for eligibility. Exclusion criteria were acute liver failure, kidney failure, contraindication to treatment, participation in another trial, refusal, technical issues, and death while awaiting transplant. Included patients were enrolled and randomized at the time of liver offer. Data were analyzed from May 20, 2019, to May 27, 2020.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants were randomized to a combined drug approach with standard of care (static cold storage) or standard of care only (control group). In the combined drug approach group, following static cold preservation, donor livers were infused with epoprostenol (ex situ, portal vein); recipients were given oral α-tocopherol and melatonin prior to anesthesia and intravenous antithrombin III, infliximab, apotransferrin, recombinant erythropoietin-β, C1-inhibitor, and glutathione during the anhepatic and reperfusion phase.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was the posttransplant peak serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level within the first 72 hours. Secondary end points were the frequencies of postreperfusion syndrome, ischemia-reperfusion injury score, early allograft dysfunction, surgical complications, ischemic cholangiopathy, acute kidney injury, acute cellular rejection, and graft and patient survival.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 93 randomized patients, 21 were excluded, resulting in 72 patients (36 per study arm) in the per protocol analysis (median recipient age, 60 years [IQR, 51.7-66.2 years]; 52 [72.2%] men). Peak AST serum levels were not different in the combined drug approach and control groups (geometric mean, 1262.9 U/L [95% CI, 946.3-1685.4 U/L] vs 1451.2 U/L [95% CI, 1087.4-1936.7 U/L]; geometric mean ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.58-1.31]; P = .49) (to convert AST to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). There also were no significant differences in the secondary end points between the groups.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      In this randomized clinical trial, the combined drug approach targeting the post-cold storage graft and the recipient did not decrease ischemic-reperfusion injury. The findings suggest that in addition to a downstream strategy that targets the preimplantation liver graft and the graft recipient, a clinically effective combined drug approach may need to include an upstream strategy that targets the donor graft during preservation. Dynamic preservation strategies may provide an appropriate delivery platform.

Pharmacogenetics of tenofovir renal toxicity in HIV-positive Southern Africans.,"Somila Mateza, Yuki Bradford, Gary Maartens, Simiso Sokhela, Nomathemba C Chandiwana, Willem D F Venter, Frank A Post, Marylyn D Ritchie, David W Haas, Phumla Sinxadi, Somila Matezaet al.",2023 Jul 1,Pharmacogenet Genomics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37099271/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      Renal toxicity is more common with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) than with tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF). We investigated whether polymorphisms in genes relevant to tenofovir disposition affect renal toxicity among HIV-positive Southern Africans.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Genetic sub-study of adults randomized to initiate TAF or TDF together with dolutegravir and emtricitabine was conducted. Outcomes were changes from week 4 to 48 in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and from baseline to week 48 in urine retinol-binding protein and urine β2-microglobulin adjusted for urinary creatinine (uRBP/Cr and uB2M/Cr). Primary analyses prioritized 14 polymorphisms previously reported to be associated with tenofovir disposition or renal outcomes, and all polymorphisms in 14 selected genes. We also explored genome-wide associations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      336 participants were enrolled. Among 14 polymorphisms of primary interest, the lowest P values for change in eGFR, uRBP/Cr, and uB2M/Cr were ABCC4 rs899494 ( P = 0.022), ABCC10 rs2125739 ( P = 0.07), and ABCC4 rs1059751 ( P = 0.0088); and in genes of interest, the lowest P values were ABCC4 rs4148481 ( P = 0.0013), rs691857 ( P = 0.00039), and PKD2 rs72659631 ( P = 0.0011). However, none of these polymorphisms withstood correction for multiple testing. Genome-wide, the lowest P values were COL27A1 rs1687402 ( P = 3.4 × 10 -9 ), CDH4 rs66494466 ( P = 5.6 × 10 -8 ), and ITGA4 rs3770126 ( P = 6.1 × 10 -7 ).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Two ABCC4 polymorphisms, rs899494 and rs1059751, were nominally associated with change in eGFR and uB2M/Cr, respectively, albeit in the opposite direction of previous reports. COL27A1 polymorphism was genome-wide significantly associated with change in eGFR."
Tacrolimus/methotrexate vs tacrolimus/reduced-dose methotrexate/mycophenolate for graft-versus-host disease prevention.,"Betty K Hamilton, Lisa A Rybicki, Hong Li, Taylor Lucas, Donna Corrigan, Matt Kalaycio, Ronald Sobecks, Rabi Hanna, Seth J Rotz, Robert M Dean, Aaron T Gerds, Deepa Jagadeesh, Claudio Brunstein, Craig S Sauter, Edward A Copelan, Navneet S Majhail, Betty K Hamiltonet al.",2023 Aug 22,Blood Adv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37352262/,No keywords found,"Tacrolimus (Tac)/methotrexate (MTX) is standard graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis; however, is associated with several toxicities. Tac, reduced-dose MTX (mini-MTX), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) have been used but never compared with standard MTX. We performed a randomized trial comparing Tac/MTX (full-MTX) with Tac/mini-MTX/MMF (mini-MTX/MMF) for GVHD prevention after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Patients (pts) receiving first myeloablative HCT using an 8/8 HLA-matched donor were eligible. Primary end points were incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD), mucositis, and engraftment. Secondary end points included chronic GVHD (cGVHD), organ toxicity, infection, relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and overall survival (OS). Ninety-six pts were randomly assigned to full-MTX (N = 49) or mini-MTX (N = 47). The majority (86%) used bone marrow grafts. There was no significant difference in grade 2-4 aGVHD (28% mini-MTX/MMF vs 27% full-MTX; P = .41); however higher incidence of grade 3-4 aGVHD (13% vs 4%; P = .07) with mini-MTX/MMF. Pts receiving mini-MTX/MMF had lower grade 3 or 4 mucositis and faster engraftment. There were no differences in moderate-to-severe cGVHD at 1 year or infections. Pts receiving mini-MTX/MMF experienced less nephrotoxicity and respiratory failure. There was no difference in the 1-year relapse (19% vs 21%; P = .89) and OS (72% vs 71%; P = .08), and mini-MTX/MMF was associated with lower but nonsignificant NRM (11% vs 22%; P = .06). Compared with full-MTX, mini-MTX/MMF was associated with no difference in grade 2-4 aGVHD and a more favorable toxicity profile. The higher severe aGVHD warrants further study to optimize this regimen. The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01951885."

      IMvigor130 demonstrated statistically significant investigator-assessed progression-free survival benefit with first-line atezolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (group A) versus placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy (group C) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Overall survival was not improved in interim analyses. Here we report the final overall analysis for group A versus group C.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this global, partially blinded, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study, patients (aged ≥18 years) with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer and who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were enrolled at 221 hospitals and oncology centres in 35 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1), with a permuted block method (block size of six) and an interactive voice and web response system, stratified by PD-L1 status, Bajorin risk factor score, and investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy, to receive atezolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (group A), atezolizumab monotherapy (group B), or placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy (group C). Sponsors, investigators, and patients were masked to assignment to atezolizumab or placebo (ie, group A and group C) and atezolizumab monotherapy (group B) was open label. For groups A and C, all patients received gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 intravenously; day 1 and day 8 of each 21-day cycle), plus investigator's choice of carboplatin (area under curve 4·5 mg/mL per min or 5 mg/mL per min; intravenously) or cisplatin (70 mg/m2 intravenously), plus either atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously) or placebo on day 1 of each cycle. Co-primary endpoints of the study were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival for group A versus group C in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, all randomised patients), and overall survival for group B versus group C, tested hierarchically. Final overall survival and updated safety outcomes (safety population; all patients who received any amount of any study treatment component) for group A versus group C are reported here. The final prespecified boundary for significance of the overall survival analysis was one-sided p=0·021. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02807636, and is active but no longer recruiting.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between July 15, 2016, and July 20, 2018, 1213 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment, of whom 851 were assigned to group A (n=451) and group C (n=400). 338 (75%) patients in group A and 298 (75%) in group C were male, 113 (25%) in group A and 102 (25%) in group C were female, and 346 (77%) in group A and 304 (76%) in group C were White. At data cutoff (Aug 31, 2022), after a median follow up of 13·4 months (IQR 6·2-30·8), median overall survival was 16·1 months (95% CI 14·2-18·8; 336 deaths) in group A versus 13·4 months (12·0-15·3; 310 deaths) in group C (stratified hazard ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·73-1·00]; one-sided p=0·023). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (168 [37%] of 454 patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs 133 [34%] of 389 who received placebo plus chemotherapy), neutropenia (167 [37%] vs 115 [30%]), decreased neutrophil count (98 [22%] vs 95 [24%]), thrombocytopenia (95 [21%] vs 70 [18%]), and decreased platelet count (92 [20%] vs 92 [24%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 243 (54%) patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and 196 (50%) patients who received placebo plus chemotherapy. Treatment-related deaths occurred in nine (2%; acute kidney injury, dyspnoea, hepatic failure, hepatitis, neutropenia, pneumonitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and thrombocytopenia [n=1 each]) patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and four (1%; unexplained death, diarrhoea, febrile neutropenia, and toxic hepatitis [n=1 each]) who received placebo plus chemotherapy.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Progression-free survival benefit with first-line combination of atezolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy did not translate into a significant improvement in overall survival in the ITT population of IMvigor130. Further research is needed to understand which patients might benefit from first-line combination treatment. No new safety signals were observed.

Efficacy and Safety of Allopurinol and Febuxostat in Patients With Gout and CKD: Subgroup Analysis of the STOP Gout Trial.,"Lindsay N Helget, Anne Davis-Karim, James R O'Dell, Ted R Mikuls, Jeff A Newcomb, Maria Androsenko, Mary T Brophy, Bryant R England, Ryan Ferguson, Michael H Pillinger, Tuhina Neogi, Hongsheng Wu, Paul M Palevsky, Lindsay N Helgetet al.",2024 Nov,Am J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38906504/,No keywords found,"Rationale & objective:
        
      
      We conducted a prespecified examination of the efficacy and safety of allopurinol and febuxostat administered using a treat-to-target strategy in trial participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Prespecified subcohort analysis of a randomized controlled trial.
    


          Setting & participants:
        
      
      A substudy of the STOP Gout Trial in participants with CKD. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30-59mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline.
    


          Exposure:
        
      
      Trial participants with CKD and gout and serum urate (SUA) concentration of≥6.8mg/dL were randomized 1:1 to receive allopurinol or febuxostat. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) was titrated during weeks 0-24 to achieve a goal SUA of<6.0mg/dL (<5.0mg/dL with tophi) (phase 1) and maintained during weeks 25-48 (phase 2). Gout flare was assessed between weeks 49-72 (phase 3).
    


          Outcome:
        
      
      Gout flare between weeks 49-72 (phase 3) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included SUA goal achievement and ULT dosing at end of phase 2, and serious adverse events.
    


          Analytical approach:
        
      
      Outcomes between treatment groups were compared using logistic regression models for binary outcomes, and Poisson regression for flare rates. Multivariable models were subsequently used, adjusting for factors identified to be imbalanced by treatment arm.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CKD was present in 351 of 940 participants; 277 were assessed for the primary outcome. Fewer patients randomized to allopurinol had a flare during phase 3 (32% vs 45%; P=0.02) despite similar attainment of the SUA goal (79% vs 81%; P=0.6) by the end of phase 2. Acute kidney injury was more common in participants with stage 3 CKD randomized to allopurinol compared with febuxostat.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Limited power to assess infrequent safety events, largely male, older population.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Allopurinol and febuxostat are similarly efficacious and well-tolerated in the treatment of gout in people with CKD when used in a treat-to-target regimen with lower incidence of gout flares in participants randomized to allopurinol.
    


          Plain-language summary:
        
      
      The STOP Gout Trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority, comparative effectiveness trial, which found that allopurinol was noninferior to febuxostat in gout flare prevention and that both medications were similarly efficacious in reaching a serum urate goal when used as part of a treat-to-target approach. A significant proportion of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are afflicted by gout, yet there is a lack of high-quality comparative effectiveness data comparing allopurinol and febuxostat in these patients. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of allopurinol and febuxostat in the subgroup of STOP Gout Trial participants with stage 3 CKD and found that allopurinol and febuxostat are similarly efficacious and well-tolerated in the treatment of gout in people with CKD when used in a treat-to-target regimen, with lower incidence of gout flares in participants randomized to allopurinol."
Favipiravir use in children with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury: is it safe?,"Yasemin Ozsurekci, Pembe Derin Oygar, Sibel Laçinel Gürlevik, Selman Kesici, Seza Ozen, Eda Didem Kurt Sukur, Bora Gülhan, Rezan Topaloglu, Benan Bayrakci, Ali Bülent Cengiz, Yasemin Ozsurekciet al.",2021 Nov,Pediatr Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34021797/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The rising number of infections due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (popularly known as COVID-19) has brought to the fore new antiviral drugs as possible treatments, including favipiravir. However, there is currently no data regarding the safety of this drug in patients with kidney impairment. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to share our experience of the use of favipiravir in pediatric patients affected by COVID-19 with any degree of kidney impairment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study enrolled pediatric patients aged under 18 years and confirmed as suffering from COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with any degree of kidney injury, who were treated with favipiravir at the time of admission.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of a total of 11 patients, 7 were diagnosed with MIS-C and 4 with severe COVID-19. The median age of the cases was 15.45 (9-17.8) years and the male/female ratio was 7/4. At the time of admission, the median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl. Nine patients were treated with favipiravir for 5 days, and 2 patients for 5 days followed by remdesivir for 5-10 days despite kidney injury at the time of admission. Seven patients underwent plasma exchange for MIS-C while 2 severely affected cases underwent continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) as well. One severe COVID-19 patient received plasma exchange as well as CKRT. Serum creatinine values returned to normal in mean 3.07 days.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Favipiravir seems a suitable therapeutic option in patients affected by COVID-19 with kidney injury without a need for dose adjustment."
Impact of Tolvaptan Combined with Low-Dose Dopamine in Heart Failure Patients with Acute Kidney Injury.,"Lingchao Yang, Jian Wang, Ying Yu, Yanyan Li, Song Zhang, Lingchao Yanget al.",2024,Int Heart J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38825491/,"Cardiac insufficiency, Cardiorenal serological index, Congestion.","The impact of tolvaptan and low-dose dopamine on heart failure (HF) patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) remains uncertain from a clinical standpoint.HF patients with AKI were selected and divided in a 1:1 fashion into the dopamine combined with the tolvaptan group (DTG), the tolvaptan group (TG), and the control group (CG). According to the standard of care, TG received tolvaptan 15 mg orally daily for a week. DTG received combination treatment, including 7 consecutive days of dopamine infusion (2 μg/kg・minutes) and oral tolvaptan 15 mg. Venous blood and urine samples were taken before and after therapy. The primary endpoint was the cardiorenal serological index after 7 days of treatment.Sixty-five patients were chosen randomly for the DTG (22 patients), TG (20 patients), and CG (23 patients), which were similar before the treatment. The serum indexes related to cardiac function (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I) in DTG were decreased, compared with TG and CG (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the serological markers of renal function (serum cystatin C, serum creatinine, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) in DTG were lower than those in TG and CG (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions among groups.Low-dose dopamine combined with tolvaptan can markedly improve patients' cardiac and renal function. This may be considered a new therapeutic method for HF patients with AKI."
Phenotype-specific therapeutic efficacy of ilofotase alfa in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.,"Niklas Bruse, Katerina Pardali, Maarten Kraan, Matthijs Kox, Peter Pickkers                              ;, REVIVAL investigators, Niklas Bruseet al.",2024 Feb 19,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38373981/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      There is no effective treatment for sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). Ilofotase alfa (human recombinant alkaline phosphatase) has been shown to exert reno-protective properties, although it remains unclear which patients might be most likely to benefit. We aimed to identify a clinical phenotype associated with ilofotase alfa's therapeutic efficacy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from 570 out of 650 patients enrolled in the REVIVAL trial were used in a stepwise machine learning approach. First, clinical variables with increasing or decreasing risk ratios for ilofotase alfa treatment across quartiles for the main secondary endpoint, Major Adverse Kidney Events up to day 90 (MAKE90), were selected. Second, linear regression analysis was used to determine the therapeutic effect size. Finally, the top-15 variables were used in different clustering analyses with consensus assessment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The optimal clustering model comprised two phenotypes. Phenotype 1 displayed relatively lower disease severity scores, and less pronounced renal and pulmonary dysfunction. Phenotype 2 exhibited higher severity scores and creatinine, with lower eGFR and bicarbonate levels. Compared with placebo treatment, ilofotase alfa significantly reduced MAKE90 events for phenotype 2 patients (54% vs. 68%, p = 0.013), but not for phenotype 1 patients (49% vs. 46%, p = 0.54).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We identified a clinical phenotype comprising severely ill patients with underlying kidney disease who benefitted most from ilofotase alfa treatment. This yields insight into the therapeutic potential of this novel treatment in more homogeneous patient groups and could guide patient selection in future trials, showing promise for personalized medicine in SA-AKI and other complex conditions."
Post hoc analysis of the SONAR trial indicates that the endothelin receptor antagonist atrasentan is associated with less pain in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.,"Kam Wa Chan, J David Smeijer, Meir Schechter, Niels Jongs, Priya Vart, Donald E Kohan, Ron T Gansevoort, Adrian Liew, Sydney C W Tang, Christoph Wanner, Dick de Zeeuw, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Kam Wa Chanet al.",2023 Dec,Kidney Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37657768/,No keywords found,"Pain is prevalent among patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The management of chronic pain in these patients is limited by nephrotoxicity of commonly used drugs including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. Since previous studies implicated endothelin-1 in pain nociception, our post hoc analysis of the SONAR trial assessed the association between the endothelin receptor antagonist atrasentan and pain and prescription of analgesics. SONAR was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that recruited participants with type 2 diabetes and CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 25-75 ml/min/1.73 m2; urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 300-5000 mg/g). Participants were randomized to receive atrasentan or placebo (1834 each arm). The main outcome was pain-related adverse events (AEs) reported by investigators. We applied Cox regression to assess the effect of atrasentan compared to placebo on the risk of the first reported pain-related AE and, secondly, first prescription of analgesics. We used the Anderson-Gill method to assess effects on all (first and subsequent) pain-related AEs. During 2.2-year median follow-up, 1183 pain-related AEs occurred. Rates for the first pain-related event were 138.2 and 170.2 per 1000 person-years in the atrasentan and placebo group respectively (hazard ratio 0.82 [95% confidence interval 0.72-0.93]). Atrasentan also reduced the rate of all (first and subsequent) pain-related AEs (rate ratio 0.80 [0.70-0.91]). These findings were similar after accounting for competing risk of death (sub-hazard ratio 0.81 [0.71-0.92]). Patients treated with atrasentan initiated fewer analgesics including NSAIDs and opioids compared to placebo during follow-up (hazard ratio = 0.72 [0.60-0.88]). Thus, atrasentan was associated with reduced pain-related events and pain-related use of analgesics in carefully selected patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD."

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of midodrine in preventing complications and improving survival in children with cirrhosis and ascites who are awaiting liver transplantation (LT).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This open-label RCT conducted from January 2022 to May 2023 included children under 18 years with cirrhosis and ascites. Patients were randomized to receive either midodrine plus standard medical therapies (SMTs) or SMT alone. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of cirrhosis-related complications within 6 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-five subjects were enrolled and randomized. Patients in the midodrine arm had a lower incidence of new-onset acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with the SMT arm (11.1% vs. 41.2%). Patients in the midodrine arm showed a decline in serum creatinine and improvement in glomerular filtration rate, whereas no changes were observed in the SMT arm. There was a lower incidence of new-onset hyponatremia in the midodrine arm (20% vs. 56%). Midodrine led to reduction in plasma rennin activity (PRA) and improvement in systemic hemodynamics. There was no difference in the rate of resolution of ascites, recurrence of ascites, requirement of therapeutic paracentesis, cumulative albumin infusion requirement, episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatic encephalopathy between the two arms.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Midodrine, when added to SMT, was effective in reducing the incidence of new-onset AKI and hyponatremia in pediatric cirrhotics awaiting LT. It also improved systemic hemodynamics and showed a trend towards reducing PRA."

      Treatment with erythropoietin is well established for anemia in chronic kidney disease patients but not well studied in acute kidney injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a multicenter, randomized, pragmatic controlled clinical trial. It included 134 hospitalized patients with anemia defined as hemoglobin < 11 g/dL and acute kidney injury defined as an increase of serum creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h or 1.5 times baseline. One arm received recombinant human erythropoietin 4000 UI subcutaneously every other day (intervention; n = 67) and the second received standard of care (control; n = 67) during the hospitalization until discharge or death. The primary outcome was the need for transfusion; secondary outcomes were death, renal recovery, need for dialysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was no statistically significant difference in transfusion need (RR = 1.05, 95%CI 0.65,1.68; p = 0.855), in renal recovery full or partial (RR = 0.96, 95%CI 0.81,1.15; p = 0.671), in need for dialysis (RR = 11.00, 95%CI 0.62, 195.08; p = 0.102) or in death (RR = 1.43, 95%CI 0.58,3.53; p = 0.440) between the erythropoietin and the control group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Erythropoietin treatment had no impact on transfusions, renal recovery or mortality in acute kidney injury patients with anemia. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03401710, 17/01/2018)."
Exploring therapeutic mechanisms of Chuan Huang Fang-II in the treatment of acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease patients from the perspective of lipidomics.,"Ling Chen, Qian Wang, Tonglu Li, Lejia Li, Chen Wang, Bing Xu, Xuezhong Gong, Ling Chenet al.",2024 Dec,Ren Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38785301/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of CHF-II in combination with RG for treating AKI on CKD (A on C), and to explore potential therapeutic mechanisms through lipidomics analysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      98 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the RG or RG + CHF groups. Both groups received RG therapy, with RG + CHF group additionally receiving CHF-II treatment over a duration of two weeks. Evaluation endpoints included changes in renal function, blood lipid profiles, urinary AKI biomarkers, and TCM symptoms before and after treatment. Serum samples were collected for lipid metabolite analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total clinical effective rate in RG + CHF group was 73.5%, and that of RG group was 40.8%. TCM syndrome scores in RG + CHF group showed a more pronounced decrease (p < 0.05). Scr, BUN, and UA levels decreased while eGFR levels increased in both groups (p < 0.05), with a greater magnitude of change observed in the RG + CHF group. Urinary AKI biomarkers decreased more in RG + CHF group (p < 0.05). No serious adverse events occurred during the trial. 58 different lipid metabolites and 48 lipid biomarkers were identified. According to the KEGG database, the possible metabolic pathways involved triglyceride metabolic pathway and fat digestion and absorption metabolic pathways.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      CHF-II effectively alleviated kidney injury and improved TCM syndrome scores in patients with A on C. Lipid differential metabolites could serve as diagnostic indicators for AKI in patients with CKD. The possible metabolic pathways might be implicated in therapeutic action of CHF-II in the prevention and treatment of patients with A on C."
Comparing The Efficacy And Safety Of Pregabalin Vs Gabapentin In Uremic Pruritus In Patients Of Chronic Kidney Injury Undergoing Haemodialysis.,"Nudrat Jehangir Khan                              ;, Wahaj                              ;, Sara Haider, Haider Gilani, Neelam Iqbal, Syed Affan Ali, Mohammad Arshad Abbasi, Nudrat Jehangir Khanet al.",2022 Jul-Sep,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36377169/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      World has been facing an epidemic of non-communicable diseases including heart, metabolic and renal diseases. Renal diseases have been commonly diagnosed and managed in low- and middle-income countries. Objective was to compare efficacy and safety of Pregabalin and Gabapentin in uremic pruritus among patients of chronic kidney injury undergoing haemodialysis. It was a comparative cross-sectional study, conducted at the Department of nephrology Abbottabad International Medical Institute. February 2021 to January 2022.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Total of 90 cases were included in the study, which were diagnosed as chronic kidney disease stage 5 undergoing haemodialysis and presented with pruritus. Pruritus was gauged on numeric rating scale and patients score of more than 6 were included. Patients were randomly divided into two groups via lottery method. Group A received Pregabalin while group B received Gabapentin. Efficacy and safety were assessed in both groups at the end of six months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of 90 dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease patients with significant pruritus included in the study, 61 (52.7%) patients were males and 29 (46.3%) were females. At the end of 6 weeks, we found out that 35 (38.9%) had no pruritus, 25 (27.8%) had mild, 19 (21.1%) had moderate while 11 (12.2%) had severe pruritus. After applying the chi-square test we found that Pregablin was statistically significantly more efficacious then Gabapentin (p-value-0.026). Sedation, nausea and blurred vision were found more in patients who took Pregabalin (p-value<0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pregablin emerged out to be more efficacious with regards to reducing pruritus of the two medications compared in our study population while patients who took Gabapentin experience significantly a smaller number of side effects as compared to patients who were given Pregabalin."
Preloading magnesium attenuates cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity: pilot randomized controlled trial (PRAGMATIC study).,"S Suppadungsuk, W Phitakwatchara, T Reungwetwattana, A Pathumarak, B Phakdeekitcharoen, C Kitiyakara, P Srisuwarn, A Davenport, A Nongnuch, S Suppadungsuket al.",2022 Feb,ESMO Open,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34953401/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cisplatin is one of the most potent chemotherapeutic drugs used in head and neck cancer treatment; however, nephrotoxicity is the major side-effect limiting usage. Magnesium supplementation has been reported to reduce risk in non-controlled studies. We investigated whether preloading with magnesium prevents nephrotoxicity with a low-dose weekly cisplatin regimen.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We carried out a prospective pilot, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial to compare cisplatin-associated acute kidney injury (cis-AKI) and acute kidney disease (cis-AKD) between two groups: intravenous 0.9% NaCl 500 ml + KCL 20 mEq over 4 h pre-cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly for 7-8 weeks (control group) compared with additional 16 mEq magnesium added to the saline infusion (Mg group) in 30 head and neck cancer patients. Cis-AKI was defined as an increased serum creatinine (SCr) ≥ 0.3 mg/dl within 7 days and cis-AKD is an increased SCr ≥ 0.3 mg/dl between last SCr and baseline pre-chemotherapy SCr.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The overall cisplatin tumor response rate and survival were comparable between groups. The baseline characteristics were comparable between groups, although SCr was lower in the controls (0.70 ± 0.17 versus 0.87 ± 0.17 mg/dl, P = 0.01). The incidence of cis-AKI was similar (4.6% versus 1.3%); however, the incidence of cis-AKD was higher for the control group (46.7% versus 6.7%, hazard ratio = 0.082, 95% confidence interval 0.008-0.79, P = 0.03). The time to develop cis-AKD was significantly shorter in the control group (P = 0.007).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The magnesium-preloading regimen was safe and significantly showed a decreased incidence of cis-AKD. The encouraging results of our pilot study need to be confirmed in a large-scale randomized controlled trial."

      Non-resuscitation fluids constitute the majority of fluid administered for septic shock patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This multicentre, randomized, feasibility trial was conducted to test the hypothesis that a restrictive protocol targeting non-resuscitation fluids reduces the overall volume administered compared with usual care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Adults with septic shock in six Swedish ICUs were randomized within 12 h of ICU admission to receive either protocolized reduction of non-resuscitation fluids or usual care. The primary outcome was the total volume of fluid administered within three days of inclusion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median (IQR) total volume of fluid in the first three days, was 6008 ml (interquartile range [IQR] 3960-8123) in the restrictive fluid group (n = 44), and 9765 ml (IQR 6804-12,401) in the control group (n = 48); corresponding to a Hodges-Lehmann median difference of 3560 ml [95% confidence interval 1614-5302]; p < 0.001). Outcome data on all-cause mortality, days alive and free of mechanical ventilation and acute kidney injury or ischemic events in the ICU within 90 days of inclusion were recorded in 98/98 (100%), 95/98 (98%) and 95/98 (98%) of participants respectively. Cognition and health-related quality of life at six months were recorded in 39/52 (75%) and 41/52 (79%) of surviving participants, respectively. Ninety out of 134 patients (67%) of eligible patients were randomized, and 15/98 (15%) of the participants experienced at least one protocol violation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Protocolized reduction of non-resuscitation fluids in patients with septic shock resulted in a large decrease in fluid administration compared with usual care. A trial using this design to test if reducing non-resuscitation fluids improves outcomes is feasible.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of renal function and kidney injury-related plasma biomarkers in a subset of HNSCC subjects receiving hdCis-RT in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT02508389) evaluating the superoxide dismutase mimetic, avasopasem manganese (AVA), an investigational new drug. We found that 90 mg AVA treatment prevented a significant reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) three months as well as six and twelve months after treatment compared to 30 mg AVA and placebo. Moreover, AVA treatment may have allowed renal repair in the first 22 days following cisplatin treatment as evidenced by an increase in epithelial growth factor (EGF), known to aid in renal recovery. An upward trend was also observed in plasma iron homeostasis proteins including total iron (Fe-blood) and iron saturation (Fe-saturation) in the 90 mg AVA group versus placebo. These data support the hypothesis that treatment with 90 mg AVA mitigates cisplatin-induced CKD by inhibiting hdCis-induced renal changes and promoting renal recovery."
Risk prediction model for cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury in patients with head and neck cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy: A re-analysis of a phase II/III JCOG1008 trial.,"Yoshinori Imamura, Naomi Kiyota, Makoto Tahara, Takeshi Kodaira, Ryuichi Hayashi, Hiroshi Nishino, Yukinori Asada, Hiroki Mitani, Shigemichi Iwae, Naoki Nishio, Yusuke Onozawa, Nobuhiro Hanai, Akira Ohkoshi, Hiroki Hara, Nobuya Monden, Masato Nagaoka, Shujiro Minami, Ryo Kitabayashi, Keita Sasaki, Akihiro Homma                              ;, Head, Neck Cancer Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG-HNCSG), Yoshinori Imamuraet al.",2024 Jul:154:106868.,Oral Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38820889/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents a major toxicity associated with cisplatin. We developed a risk prediction model for cisplatin-induced AKI in patients with postoperative high-risk head and neck cancer who received chemoradiotherapy during a randomized phase II/III trial, JCOG1008.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Two hundred and fifty-one patients received radiotherapy with weekly cisplatin at 40 mg/m2 (weekly arm) or 3-weekly cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 (3-weekly arm). AKI was defined using the AKI Network classification/staging system as increased serum creatinine of ≥0.3 mg/dL or a ≥1.5-fold increase from baseline 30 days after completing chemoradiotherapy. The Akaike information criterion was used to explore the optimal model by combining explanatory variables at registration.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among the 251 patients (210 men and 41 women (median age; 62 years)), 94 (37.5 %) developed cisplatin-induced AKI. The optimal cisplatin-induced AKI risk prediction model comprised four factors, including a primary site of hypopharynx/larynx (vs. oral cavity/oropharynx), 3-weekly arm (vs. weekly arm), serum albumin of ≤3.5 g/dL (vs. >3.5 g/dL) and creatinine clearance (CCr) of <90 mL/min (vs. ≥90 mL/min). The incidence of cisplatin-induced AKI rose with cumulative count of the four factors. When the cumulative count was ≥2, the positive predictive value for cisplatin-induced AKI was 50.3 %.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We developed a risk prediction model for cisplatin-induced AKI in patients with head and neck cancer who received postoperative chemoradiotherapy using primary site, cisplatin administration method, serum albumin, and CCr. Patients with risk factors unrelated to the cisplatin administration method should adopt a weekly cisplatin regimen."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is poorly understood and it is unknown if it can be attenuated using erythropoietin (EPO).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Pre-planned analysis of patients included in the EPO-TBI (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00987454) trial who were randomized to weekly EPO (40 000 units) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) subcutaneously up to three doses or until intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Creatinine levels and urinary output (up to 7 days) were categorized according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) classification. Severity of TBI was categorized with the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 3348 screened patients, 606 were randomized and 603 were analyzed. Of these, 82 (14%) patients developed AKI according to KDIGO (60 [10%] with KDIGO 1, 11 [2%] patients with KDIGO 2, and 11 [2%] patients with KDIGO 3). Male gender (hazard ratio [HR] 4.0 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-11.2, P = 0.008) and severity of TBI (HR 1.3 95% CI 1.1-1.4, P < 0.001 for each 10% increase in risk of poor 6 month outcome) predicted time to AKI.

EPO did not influence time to AKI (HR 1.08 95% CI 0.7-1.67, P = 0.73) or creatinine levels during ICU stay (P = 0.09).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury is more common in male patients and those with severe compared to moderate TBI and appears associated with worse outcome. EPO does not prevent AKI after TBI."

      Isatuximab is a CD38 monoclonal antibody approved for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We aimed to evaluate the addition of isatuximab to weekly carfilzomib (K), lenalidomide (R), and dexamethasone (d; Isa-KRd) in transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and stratified maintenance by cytogenetic risk.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This single-arm phase 2 trial was done at three cancer centres (two hospitals and a cancer institute) in Boston (MA, USA). Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years and had transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and an ECOG performance status of 2 or less. Patients received four 28-day cycles of Isa-KRd, including isatuximab 10 mg/kg intravenously weekly for 8 weeks, then every other week for 16 weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter; carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 (20 mg/m2 for cycle 1 day 1); lenalidomide 25 mg orally on days 1-21; and dexamethasone 20 mg orally the day of and day after all doses of carfilzomib and isatuximab. Consolidation involved either upfront haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) with two additional cycles or deferred HSCT with four additional cycles of treatment. The primary endpoint was complete response after four cycles of treatment. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. All patients who received one dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04430894, and has completed enrolment.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between July 31, 2020 and Jan 31, 2022, 50 patients were enrolled. Median age was 59 years (range 40-70), 54% (27 of 50 patients) were male, and 44 (88%) were White. 46% (23 of 50) of patients had high-risk cytogenetics. Median follow-up was 26 months (IQR 20·7-30·1). 32% (16 of 50 patients) achieved a complete response after four cycles. The overall response rate (ORR) was 90% (45 patients) and 78% (39 patients) achieved a very good partial response (VGPR) or better. After completion of consolidation, 58% (29 patients) achieved a complete response; the ORR was 90% (45 patients) and 86% (43 patients) achieved a VGPR or better. The most common grade 3 or 4 side-effects (≥two patients) included neutropenia (13 [26%] of 50 patients), elevated alanine aminotransferase (six [12%] patients), fatigue (three [6%] patients), thrombocytopenia (three [6%] patients), acute kidney injury (two [4%] patients), anaemia (two [4%] patients), and febrile neutropenia (two [4%] patients). Grade 1-2 infusion-related reactions were seen in 20% (ten patients), with none grade 3. Grade 1-2 hypertension was seen in 14% (seven patients) with one grade 3 (one [2%] patient). There were two deaths assessed as unrelated to treatment.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Although the study did not achieve the prespecified complete response threshold, Isa-KRd induced deep and durable responses in transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The treatment proved safe and consistent with similar regimens in this setting.

"Effects of levosimendan on renal blood flow and glomerular filtration in patients with acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery: a double blind, randomized placebo-controlled study.","Maria Tholén, Sven-Erik Ricksten, Lukas Lannemyr, Maria Tholénet al.",2021 Jun 12,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34118980/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication after cardiac surgery, and current strategies aimed at treating AKI have proven ineffective. Levosimendan, an inodilatating agent, has been shown to increase renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in uncomplicated postoperative patients and in patients with the cardiorenal syndrome. We hypothesized that levosimendan through its specific effects on renal vasculature, a preferential vasodilating effect on preglomerular resistance vessels, could improve renal function in AKI-patients with who did not have clinical indication for inotropic support.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled study, adult patients with postoperative AKI within 2 days after cardiac surgery, who were hemodynamically stable with a central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) ≥ 60% without inotropic support were eligible for inclusion. After randomization, study drug infusions, levosimendan (n = 16) or placebo (n = 13) were given for 5 h. A bolus infusion of levosimendan (12 µg/kg), were given for 30 min followed by 0.1 µg/kg/min for 5 h. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were measured using infusion clearance of para-aminohippuric acid and a filtration marker, respectively. As a safety issue, norepinephrine was administered to maintain mean arterial pressure between 70-80 mmHg. Intra-group differences were tested by Mann-Whitney U-tests, and a linear mixed model was used to test time and group interaction.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-nine patients completed the study. At inclusion, the mean serum creatinine was higher in the patients randomized to levosimendan (148 ± 29 vs 127 ± 22 µmol/L, p = 0.030), and the estimated GFR was lower (46 ± 12 vs 57 ± 11 ml/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.025). Levosimendan induced a significantly (p = 0.011) more pronounced increase in renal blood flow (15%) compared placebo (3%) and a more pronounced decrease in renal vascular resistance (- 18% vs. - 4%, respectively, p = 0.043). There was a trend for a minor increase in glomerular filtration rate with levosimendan (4.5%, p = 0.079), which did differ significantly from the placebo group (p = 0.440). The mean norepinephrine dose was increased by 82% in the levosimedan group and decreased by 29% in the placebo group (p = 0.012).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In hemodynamically stable patients with AKI after cardiac surgery, levosimendan increases renal blood flow through renal vasodilatation. Trial registration NCT02531724, prospectly registered on 08/20/2015. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02531724?cond=AKI&cntry=SE&age=1&draw=2&rank=1."
Serial Quantification of Urinary Protein Biomarkers to Predict Drug-induced Acute Kidney Injury.,"Yi Da, K Akalya, Tanusya Murali, Anantharaman Vathsala, Chuen-Seng Tan, Sanmay Low, Hui-Ning Lim, Boon-Wee Teo, Titus Lau, Lizhen Ong, Horng-Ruey Chua, Yi Daet al.",2019,Curr Drug Metab,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31296157/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Drug-induced Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) develops in 10-15% of patients who receive nephrotoxic medications. Urinary biomarkers of renal tubular dysfunction may detect nephrotoxicity early and predict AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We prospectively studied patients who received aminoglycosides, vancomycin, amphotericin, or calcineurin inhibitors, and collected their serial urine while on therapy. Patients who developed drug-induced AKI (fulfilling KDIGO criteria) were matched with non-AKI controls in a 1:2 ratio. Their urine samples were batch-analyzed at time-intervals leading up to AKI onset; the latter benchmarked against the final day of nephrotoxic therapy in non- AKI controls. Biomarkers examined include clusterin, beta-2-microglobulin, KIM1, MCP1, cystatin-C, trefoil-factor- 3, NGAL, interleukin-18, GST-Pi, calbindin, and osteopontin; biomarkers were normalized with corresponding urine creatinine.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine of 84 (11%) patients developed drug-induced AKI. Biomarkers from 7 AKI cases with pre-AKI samples were compared with those from 14 non-AKI controls. Corresponding mean ages were 55(±17) and 52(±16) years; baseline eGFR were 99(±21) and 101(±24) mL/min/1.73m2 (all p=NS). Most biomarker levels peaked before the onset of AKI. Median levels of 5 biomarkers were significantly higher in AKI cases than controls at 1-3 days before AKI onset (all µg/mmol): clusterin [58(8-411) versus 7(3-17)], beta-2-microglobulin [1632(913-3823) versus 253(61-791)], KIM1 [0.16(0.13-0.76) versus 0.07(0.05-0.15)], MCP1 [0.40(0.16-1.90) versus 0.07(0.04-0.17)], and cystatin-C [33(27-2990) versus 11(7-19)], all p<0.05; their AUROC for AKI prediction were >0.80 (confidence intervals >0.50), with average accuracy highest for clusterin (86%), followed by beta-2-microglobulin, cystatin-C, MCP1, and KIM1 (57%) after cross-validation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Serial surveillance of these biomarkers could improve the lead time for nephrotoxicity detection by days."
Effects of the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on glomerular and tubular injury markers.,"Claire C J Dekkers, Sergei Petrykiv, Gozewijn D Laverman, David Z Cherney, Ron T Gansevoort, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Claire C J Dekkerset al.",2018 Aug,Diabetes Obes Metab,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29573529/,"KIM-1, MCP-1, SGLT-2, acute kidney injury, dapagliflozin, type 2 diabetes.","The mechanisms by which SGLT-2 inhibitors lower albuminuria are incompletely understood. We assessed in a post-hoc analysis of a cross-over trial the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on glomerular markers (IgG to IgG4 and IgG to albumin), tubular markers (urinary KIM-1, NGAL and LFABP) and inflammatory markers (urinary MCP-1 and IL-6) to provide more insight into kidney protective effects. Dapagliflozin decreased albuminuria by 43.9% (95% CI, 30.3%-54.8%) and eGFR by 5.1 (2.0-8.1) mL/min/1.73m2 compared to placebo. Dapagliflozin did not change glomerular charge or size selectivity index compared to placebo. Dapagliflozin decreased urinary KIM-1 excretion by 22.6% (0.3%-39.8%; P = .05) and IL-6 excretion by 23.5% (1.4%-40.6%; P = .04) compared to placebo, whereas no changes in NGAL, LFABP and MCP-1 were observed. During dapagliflozin treatment, changes in albuminuria correlated with changes in eGFR (r = 0.36; P = .05) and KIM-1 (r = 0.39; P = .05). In conclusion, the albuminuria-lowering effect of 6 weeks of dapagliflozin therapy may be the result of decreased intraglomerular pressure or reduced tubular cell injury."
Safety and Feasibility of Regional Citrate Anticoagulation for Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy With Calcium-Containing Solutions: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Shan Huang, Guangfeng Sun, Penglong Wu, LinJing Wu, Hongfei Jiang, Xixing Wang, Liyuan Li, Lingling Gao, Fanqi Meng, Shan Huanget al.",2024 May-Jun,Semin Dial,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38439685/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Calcium-free (Ca-free) solutions are theoretically the most ideal for regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). However, the majority of medical centers in China had to make a compromise of using commercially available calcium-containing (Ca-containing) solutions instead of Ca-free ones due to their scarcity. This study was designed to probe into the potential of Ca-containing solution as a secure and efficient substitution for Ca-free solutions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective, randomized single-center trial, 99 patients scheduled for CRRT were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups: continuous veno-venous hemodialysis Ca-free dialysate (CVVHD Ca-free) group, continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration calcium-free dialysate (CVVHDF Ca-free) group, and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration Ca-containing dialysate (CVVHDF Ca-containing) group at cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). The primary endpoint was the incidence of metabolic complications. The secondary endpoints included premature termination of treatment, thrombus of filter, and bubble trap after the process.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of citrate accumulation (18.2% vs. 12.1% vs. 21.2%) and metabolic alkalosis (12.1% vs. 0% vs. 9.1%) did not significantly differ among three groups (p > 0.05 for both). The incidence of premature termination was comparable among the groups (18.2% vs. 9.1% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.582). The thrombus level of the filter and bubble trap was similar in the three groups (p > 0.05 for all).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In RCA-CRRT for CICU population, RCA-CVVHDF with Ca-containing solutions and traditional RCA with Ca-free solutions had a comparable safety and feasibility.

The Effect of Curcumin on Renal Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Diabetic Rats.,"Douglas Ikedo Machado, Eloiza de Oliveira Silva, Sara Ventura, Maria de Fatima Fernandes Vattimo, Douglas Ikedo Machadoet al.",2022 Jul 7,Nutrients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35889755/,"curcumin, diabetes, ischemia/reperfusion.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are global health problems that affect over 850 million people, twice the number of diabetic individuals around the world. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known to increase the susceptibility to AKI. Plants and foods, such as curcumin, are traditionally used as treatments for various diseases due to its wide range of bioactive compounds that exert antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and anticancer properties. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of curcumin in diabetic rats with AKI. Adult male Wistar rats, weighing between 250 and 290 g, were randomized into four groups: Citrate (citrate buffer, i.v., single dose, on Day 1 of the protocol); DM (streptozotocin (STZ), 65 mg/k, single dose, i.v., on Day 1); DM + I/R (DM rats that, on Day 26, had the renal pedicle clamped for 30 min on both sides); DM + I/R + Curcumin (DM + I/R rats submitted to curcumin treatment). Results showed that IR worsened renal function and oxidative stress in DM rats, but the DM + IR + Curcumin group showed an increase in inulin clearance and a decrease in serum creatinine and in NGAL, in addition to an improvement in renal hemodynamics. These effects were accompanied by a reduction in oxidative and nitrosative metabolites and an increase in the thiol antioxidant reserve when curcumin was administered to the DM + IR group."

Kidney Biomarkers of Injury and Repair as Predictors of Contrast-Associated AKI: A Substudy of the PRESERVE Trial.,"Chirag R Parikh, Caroline Liu, Maria K Mor, Paul M Palevsky, James S Kaufman, Heather Thiessen Philbrook, Steven D Weisbord, Chirag R Parikhet al.",2020 Feb,Am J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31547939/,No keywords found,"Rationale & objective:
        
      
      The PRESERVE trial used a 2 × 2 factorial design to compare intravenous saline solution with intravenous sodium bicarbonate solution and oral N-acetylcysteine with placebo for the prevention of 90-day major adverse kidney events and death (MAKE-D) and contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) among patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing angiography. In this ancillary study, we evaluated the predictive capacities of preangiography injury and repair proteins in urine and plasma for MAKE-D, CA-AKI, and their impact on trial design.
    


          Study design:

          Setting & participants:
        
      
      A subset of participants from the PRESERVE trial.
    


          Exposures:
        
      
      Injury (KIM-1, NGAL, and IL-18) and repair (MCP-1, UMOD, and YKL-40) proteins in urine and plasma 1 to 2 hours preangiography.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      MAKE-D and CA-AKI.
    


          Analytical approach:
        
      
      We analyzed the associations of preangiography biomarkers with MAKE-D and with CA-AKI. We evaluated whether the biomarker levels could enrich the MAKE-D event rate and improve future clinical trial efficiency through an online biomarker prognostic enrichment tool available at prognosticenrichment.com.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We measured plasma biomarkers in 916 participants and urine biomarkers in 797 participants. After adjusting for urinary albumin-creatinine ratio and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, preangiography levels of 4 plasma (KIM-1, NGAL, UMOD, and YKL-40) and 3 urine (NGAL, IL-18, and YKL-40) biomarkers were associated with MAKE-D. Only plasma KIM-1 level was significantly associated with CA-AKI after adjustment. Biomarker levels provided modest discriminatory capacity for MAKE-D. Screening patients using the 50th percentile of preangiography plasma KIM-1 or YKL-40 levels would have reduced the required sample size by 30% (∼2,000 participants).
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Evaluation of prognostic enrichment does not account for changing trial costs, time needed to screen patients, or loss to follow-up. Most participants were male, limiting the generalizability of our findings.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Preangiography levels of injury and repair biomarkers modestly predict the development of MAKE-D and can be used to improve the efficiency of future CA-AKI trials."

Its use has been associated with cardiovascular toxicity but although recently a signal of clinically significant renal complications has also been identified, it is less extensively investigated. We analyzed data of 114 consecutive patients with RRMM who received CFZ-based regimens. Renal complications not related to MM progression were observed in 19 (17%) patients; thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) was seen in 6 (5%) patients, albuminuria >1 gr/day in 7 patients (6%) and at least grade 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) which could not be otherwise explained in 6 patients (5%). A total of 15 patients discontinued CFZ and dosing was reinitiated at a lower level in one patient with AKI. Albuminuria was associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in the renal biopsy (performed in a total of 6 patients). Renal complications during CFZ therapy are common, occur mostly early and are unpredictable. A potential effect of CFZ on the renal endothelium could be implicated in the pathogenesis of these complications and may also share common pathophysiology with cardiovascular effects of CFZ."

"Stereotactic body radiotherapy with or without selective dismutase mimetic in pancreatic adenocarcinoma: an adaptive, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1b/2 trial.","Cullen M Taniguchi, Jessica M Frakes, Todd A Aguilera, Manisha Palta, Brian Czito, Manoop S Bhutani, Lauren E Colbert, Joseph Abi Jaoude, Vincent Bernard, Shubham Pant, Ching-Wei D Tzeng, Dae Won Kim, Mokenge Malafa, James Costello, Geena Mathew, Neal Rebueno, Eugene J Koay, Prajnan Das, Ethan B Ludmir, Matthew H G Katz, Robert A Wolff, Sam Beddar, Gabriel O Sawakuchi, Shalini Moningi, Rebecca S Slack Tidwell, Ying Yuan, Peter F Thall, Robert A Beardsley, Jon Holmlund, Joseph M Herman, Sarah E Hoffe, Cullen M Taniguchiet al.",2023 Dec,Lancet Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38039992/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has the potential to ablate localised pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Selective dismutase mimetics sensitise tumours while reducing normal tissue toxicity. This trial was designed to establish the efficacy and toxicity afforded by the selective dismutase mimetic avasopasem manganese when combined with ablative SBRT for localised pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this adaptive, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1b/2 trial, patients aged 18 years or older with borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic cancer who had received at least 3 months of chemotherapy and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were enrolled at six academic sites in the USA. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1), with block randomisation (block sizes of 6-12) with a maximum of 24 patients per group, to receive daily avasopasem (90 mg) or placebo intravenously directly before (ie, within 180 min) SBRT (50, 55, or 60 Gy in five fractions, adaptively assigned in real time by Bayesian estimates of 90-day safety and efficacy). Patients and physicians were masked to treatment group allocation, but not to SBRT dose. The primary objective was to find the optimal dose of SBRT with avasopasem or placebo as determined by the late onset EffTox method. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03340974, and is complete.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Jan 25, 2018, and April 29, 2020, 47 patients were screened, of whom 42 were enrolled (median age was 71 years [IQR 63-75], 23 [55%] were male, 19 [45%] were female, 37 [88%] were White, three [7%] were Black, and one [2%] each were unknown or other races) and randomly assigned to avasopasem (n=24) or placebo (n=18); the placebo group was terminated early after failing to meet prespecified efficacy parameters. At data cutoff (June 28, 2021), the avasopasem group satisfied boundaries for both efficacy and toxicity. Late onset EffTox efficacy response was observed in 16 (89%) of 18 patients at 50 Gy and six (100%) of six patients at 55 Gy in the avasopasem group, and was observed in three (50%) of six patients at 50 Gy and nine (75%) of 12 patients at 55 Gy in the placebo group, and the Bayesian model recommended 50 Gy or 55 Gy in five fractions with avasopasem for further study. Serious adverse events of any cause were reported in three (17%) of 18 patients in the placebo group and six (25%) of 24 in the avasopasem group. In the placebo group, grade 3 adverse events within 90 days of SBRT were abdominal pain, acute cholangitis, pyrexia, increased blood lactic acid, and increased lipase (one [6%] each); no grade 4 events occurred. In the avasopasem group, grade 3-4 adverse events within 90 days of SBRT were acute kidney injury, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, haematoma, colitis, gastric obstruction, lung infection, abdominal abscess, post-surgical atrial fibrillation, and pneumonia leading to respiratory failure (one [4%] each).There were no treatment-related deaths but one late death in the avasopasem group due to sepsis in the setting of duodenal obstruction after off-study treatment was reported as potentially related to SBRT.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      SBRT that uses 50 or 55 Gy in five fractions can be considered for patients with localised pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The addition of avasopasem might further enhance disease outcomes. A larger phase 2 trial (GRECO-2, NCT04698915) is underway to validate these results.

      There is an unmet need for effective therapies in pretreated advanced biliary tract cancer. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of nanoliposomal irinotecan and fluorouracil plus leucovorin compared with fluorouracil plus leucovorin as second-line treatment for biliary tract cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      NALIRICC was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial done in 17 German centres for patients aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, metastatic biliary tract cancer, and progression on gemcitabine-based therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous infusions of nanoliposomal irinotecan (70 mg/m2), fluorouracil (2400 mg/m2), and leucovorin (400 mg/m2) every 2 weeks (nanoliposomal irinotecan group) or fluorouracil (2400 mg/m2) plus leucovorin (400 mg/m2) every 2 weeks (control group). Randomisation was by permutated block randomisation in block sizes of four, stratified by primary tumour site. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was the primary endpoint, which was evaluated in all randomly assigned patients. Secondary efficacy outcomes were overall survival, objective response rate, and quality of life. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment. Enrolment for this trial has been completed, and it is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03043547.
    


          Finding:
        
      
      Between Dec 4, 2017, and Aug 2, 2021, 49 patients were randomly assigned to the nanoliposomal irinotecan group and 51 patients to the control group. Median age was 65 years (IQR 59-71); 45 (45%) of 100 patients were female. Median progression-free survival was 2·6 months (95% CI 1·7-3·6) in the nanoliposomal irinotecan group and 2·3 months (1·6-3·4) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·87 [0·56-1·35]). Median overall survival was 6·9 months (95% CI 5·3-10·6) in the nanoliposomal irinotecan group and 8·2 months (5·4-11·9) in the control group (HR 1·08 [0·68-1·72]). The objective response rate was 14% (95% CI 6-27; seven patients) in the nanoliposomal irinotecan group and 4% (1-14; two patients) in the control group. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the nanoliposomal irinotecan group were neutropenia (eight [17%] of 48 vs none in the control group), diarrhoea (seven [15%] vs one [2%]), and nausea (four [8%] vs none). In the control group, the most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were cholangitis (four [8%] patients vs none in the nanoliposomal irinotecan group) and bile duct stenosis (four [8%] vs three [6%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 16 (33%) patients in the nanoliposomal irinotecan group (grade 2-3 diarrhoea in five patients; one case each of abdominal infection, acute kidney injury, pancytopenia, increased blood bilirubin, colitis, dehydration, dyspnoea, infectious enterocolitis, ileus, oral mucositis, and nausea). One (2%) treatment-related serious adverse event occurred in the control group (worsening of general condition). Median duration until deterioration of global health status, characterised by the time from randomisation to the initial observation of a score decline exceeding 10 points, was 4·0 months (95% CI 2·2-not reached) in the nanoliposomal irinotecan group and 3·7 months (2·7-not reached) in the control group.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      The addition of nanoliposomal irinotecan to fluorouracil plus leucovorin did not improve progression-free survival or overall survival and was associated with higher toxicity compared with fluorouracil plus leucovorin. Further research is necessary to define the role of irinotecan-based combinations in second-line treatment of biliary tract cancer.

Tight vs liberal control of mild postpartum hypertension: a randomized controlled trial.,"Oluyemi A Aderibigbe, David N Hackney, Angela C Ranzini, Justin R Lappen, Oluyemi A Aderibigbeet al.",2023 Feb,Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36402355/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      High-quality evidence to inform the management of postpartum hypertension, including the optimal blood pressure threshold to initiate therapy, is lacking. Randomized trials have been conducted in pregnancy, but there are no published trials to guide management in the postpartum period.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to test the hypothesis that initiating antihypertensive therapy in the postpartum period at a threshold of 140/90 mm Hg would result in less maternal morbidity than initiating therapy at a threshold of 150/95 mm Hg.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      We performed a pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients aged 18 to 55 years with postpartum hypertension. Patients with chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia without severe features were randomized to 1 of 2 blood pressure thresholds to initiate treatment: persistent blood pressure of ≥150/95 mm Hg (institutional standard or ""liberal control"" group) or ≥140/90 mm Hg (intervention or ""tight control"" group). Our primary outcome was composite maternal morbidity defined as: severe hypertension (blood pressure ≥160/110 mm Hg) or preeclampsia with severe features, the need for a second antihypertensive agent, postpartum hospitalization >4 days, and maternal adverse outcome secondary to hypertension as evidenced by pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury (creatinine level ≥1.1 mg/dL), cardiac dysfunction (eg, elevated brain natriuretic peptide level) or cardiomyopathy, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, or admission to an intensive care unit. Secondary outcomes included hospital readmission for hypertension, persistence of hypertension beyond 14 days, medication side effects, and time to blood pressure control. We calculated that 256 women would provide 90% power to detect a relative 50% reduction in the primary outcome from 36% in the standard blood pressure threshold group to 18%, with a 2-sided alpha set at 0.05 for significance. Data were analyzed using R statistical software.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 256 patients were randomized, including 128 to the ""tight control"" group (140/90 mm Hg) and 128 to the ""liberal control"" group (150/95 mm Hg). Patients in the ""tight control"" group had a higher body mass index at delivery (37.1±9.4 vs 34.9±8.1; P=.04); other demographic and obstetrical characteristics were similar between groups. The rate of the primary outcome was similar between groups (8.6% vs 11.7%; P=.41; relative risk, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-1.53). The rates of all secondary outcomes and the individual components of the primary and secondary outcome measures were also similar between groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In the postpartum period, initiation of antihypertensive therapy at a lower blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mm Hg did not decrease maternal morbidity or improve outcomes compared with a threshold of 150/95 mm Hg."

Also, nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity are reported as adverse events. We retrospectively reviewed renal and liver functions of Covid-19 103 patients who received remdesivir in the 15 days after treatment initiation. Approximately 20% of the patient population met randomized clinical trial exclusion criteria. In total, 11% of the patients had a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate >10 mL/min/1.73m2 . Also, 25 and 35% had increased alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels, respectively. However, serious adverse events were limited. Therefore, based on these preliminary results, contraindications based on kidney and liver function should not be absolute for remdesivir treatment in patients with Covid-19 if these functions are monitored regularly. A larger patient cohort is warranted to confirm our results."
"Efficacy and safety of Yiqi Peiyuan granules for improving the short-term prognosis of patients with acute kidney injury: A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.","Jia-Jia Wu, Tian-Yi Zhang, Ying-Hui Qi, Min-Yan Zhu, Yan Fang, Chao-Jun Qi, Li-Ou Cao, Ji-Fang Lu, Bo-Han Lu, Lu-Min Tang, Jian-Xiao Shen, Shan Mou, Jia-Jia Wuet al.",2024 May,J Integr Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38688809/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Yiqi Peiyuan (YQPY) prescription, a composite prescription of traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to prevent or delay the continued deterioration of renal function after acute kidney injury (AKI) in some institutions and has shown considerable efficacy.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This is the first randomized controlled trial to assess efficacy and safety of YQPY for improving short-term prognosis in adult patients with AKI.
    


          Design, setting, participants and interventions:
        
      
      This is a prospective, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 144 enrolled participants were randomly allocated to two groups according to a randomization schedule. Participants, caregivers and investigators assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment. Patients in the YQPY group received 36 g YQPY granules twice a day for 28 days. Patients in the placebo group received a placebo in the same dose as the YQPY granules.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was the change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between baseline and after 4 and 24 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes were the change of serum creatinine (Scr) level between baseline and after treatment, and the incidence of endpoint events, defined as eGFR increasing by more than 25% above baseline, eGFR >75 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or the composite endpoint, which was defined as the sum of patients meeting either of the above criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data from a total of 114 patients (59 in the YQPY group and 55 in the control group) were analyzed. The mean changes in eGFR and Scr in weeks 4 and 24 had no difference between the two groups. In further subgroup analysis (22 in the YQPY group and 31 in the control group), the mean change in eGFR after treatment for 4 weeks was 27.39 mL/min per 1.73 m2 in the YQPY group and 5.78 mL/min per 1.73 m2 in the placebo group, and the mean difference between groups was 21.61 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (P < 0.001). Thirteen (59.1%) patients in the YQPY group and 5 (16.1%) in the placebo group reached the composite endpoints (P = 0.002). During the intervention, 2 and 4 severe adverse events were reported in the YQPY and placebo groups, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The YQPY granules can effectively improve the renal function of patients 4 weeks after the onset of AKI, indicating that it has good efficacy for improving short-term renal outcomes in patients with AKI. The YQPY granules may be a promising therapy for adults with AKI.

High-Dose Perioperative Atorvastatin and Acute Kidney Injury Following Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Frederic T Billings th, Patricia A Hendricks, Jonathan S Schildcrout, Yaping Shi, Michael R Petracek, John G Byrne, Nancy J Brown, Frederic T Billings thet al.",2016 Mar 1,JAMA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26906014/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Statins affect several mechanisms underlying acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To test the hypothesis that short-term high-dose perioperative atorvastatin would reduce AKI following cardiac surgery.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of adult cardiac surgery patients conducted from November 2009 to October 2014 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients naive to statin treatment (n = 199) were randomly assigned 80 mg of atorvastatin the day before surgery, 40 mg of atorvastatin the morning of surgery, and 40 mg of atorvastatin daily following surgery (n = 102) or matching placebo (n = 97). Patients already taking a statin prior to study enrollment (n = 416) continued taking the preenrollment statin until the day of surgery, were randomly assigned 80 mg of atorvastatin the morning of surgery and 40 mg of atorvastatin the morning after (n = 206) or matching placebo (n = 210), and resumed taking the previously prescribed statin on postoperative day 2.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury defined as an increase of 0.3 mg/dL in serum creatinine concentration within 48 hours of surgery (Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the group naive to statin treatment due to increased AKI among these participants with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) receiving atorvastatin. The board later recommended stopping for futility after 615 participants (median age, 67 years; 188 [30.6%] were women; 202 [32.8%] had diabetes) completed the study. Among all participants (n = 615), AKI occurred in 64 of 308 (20.8%) in the atorvastatin group vs 60 of 307 (19.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk [RR], 1.06 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.46]; P = .75). Among patients naive to statin treatment (n = 199), AKI occurred in 22 of 102 (21.6%) in the atorvastatin group vs 13 of 97 (13.4%) in the placebo group (RR, 1.61 [0.86 to 3.01]; P = .15) and serum creatinine concentration increased by a median of 0.11 mg/dL (10th-90th percentile, -0.11 to 0.56 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin group vs by a median of 0.05 mg/dL (10th-90th percentile, -0.12 to 0.33 mg/dL) in the placebo group (mean difference, 0.08 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.15 mg/dL]; P = .007). Among patients already taking a statin (n = 416), AKI occurred in 42 of 206 (20.4%) in the atorvastatin group vs 47 of 210 (22.4%) in the placebo group (RR, 0.91 [0.63 to 1.32]; P = .63).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, high-dose perioperative atorvastatin treatment compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of AKI overall, among patients naive to treatment with statins, or in patients already taking a statin. These results do not support the initiation of statin therapy to prevent AKI following cardiac surgery.

Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Surgery for Colorectal Cancer.,"Wenqin Sun, Fengling Li, Xianxue Wang, Hongbo Liu, Hong Mo, Daobo Pan, Shihong Wen, Aiguo Zhou, Wenqin Sunet al.",2021 Nov:267:687-694.,J Surg Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34274907/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery has a systemic impact on the renal system and might contribute to acute kidney injury or postoperative renal dysfunction. However, effective preventive strategies are still lacking. We aimed to explore the effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on kidney and other organ function in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Fifty-six patients were randomly enrolled into the Control or DEX group. The DEX group received 1 µg kg-1 DEX intravenously within 10 min followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 µg kg-1 h-1 infused until 30 min before closing the peritoneum. In the Control group, 0.9% sodium chloride was administered as a placebo. The primary outcome was serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels reflecting kidney injury. Secondary outcomes included variables reflecting the kidney, intestinal injury and systemic inflammatory response.
    


          Results:
        
      
      NGAL levels were significantly lower in the DEX group than in the Control group at 1 d and 5 d postoperatively (107.5 ± 55.6 ng mL-1versus 179.5 ± 78.2 ng mL-1; 70.3 ± 45.8 ng mL-1versus 135.2 ± 59.6 ng mL-1, P < 0.001), while the BUN and Cr levels showed no differences between the groups. Serum DAO activity was significantly lower in the DEX group patients 24 h after surgery. Moreover, I-FABP levels were markedly lower at 2 h and 24 h postoperatively in the DEX group than in the Control group (P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Perioperative DEX administration may potentially confer kidney and intestinal protection during laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer patients."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common after major abdominal surgery. Selection of candidate kidney protective strategies for testing in large trials should be based on robust preliminary evidence.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A secondary analysis of the Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery (RELIEF) trial was conducted in adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and randomly assigned to a restrictive or liberal perioperative fluid regimen. The primary outcome was maximum AKI stage before hospital discharge. Two multivariable ordinal regression models were developed to test the primary hypothesis that modifiable risk factors associated with increased maximum stage of postoperative AKI could be identified. Each model used a separate approach to variable selection to assess the sensitivity of the findings to modeling approach. For model 1, variable selection was informed by investigator opinion; for model 2, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique was used to develop a data-driven model from available variables.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 2,444 patients analyzed, stage 1, 2, and 3 AKI occurred in 223 (9.1%), 59 (2.4%), and 36 (1.5%) patients, respectively. In multivariable modeling by model 1, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, intraoperatively only (odds ratio, 1.77 [99% CI, 1.11 to 2.82]), and preoperative day-of-surgery administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker compared to no regular use (odds ratio, 1.84 [99% CI, 1.15 to 2.94]) were associated with increased odds for greater maximum stage AKI. These results were unchanged in model 2, with the additional finding of an inverse association between nadir hemoglobin concentration on postoperative day 1 and greater maximum stage AKI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Avoiding intraoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is a potential strategy to mitigate the risk for postoperative AKI. The findings strengthen the rationale for a clinical trial comprehensively testing the risk-benefit ratio of these drugs in the perioperative period."
Risk Factors for Nephrotoxicity in Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Bacteraemia: A Post Hoc Analysis of the CAMERA2 Trial.,"Amy Legg, Niamh Meagher, Sandra A Johnson, Matthew A Roberts, Alan Cass, Marc H Scheetz, Jane Davies, Jason A Roberts, Joshua S Davis, Steven Y C Tong, Amy Legget al.",2023 Jan,Clin Drug Investig,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36217068/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Clinical risk factors for nephrotoxicity in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia remain largely undetermined, despite its common occurrence and clinical significance. In an international, multicentre, prospective clinical trial (CAMERA2), which compared standard therapy (vancomycin monotherapy) to combination therapy (adding an anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam) for methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteraemia, significantly more people in the combination therapy arm experienced acute kidney injury compared with those in the monotherapy arm (23% vs 6%).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this post hoc analysis was to explore in greater depth the risk factors for acute kidney injury from the CAMERA2 trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Among participants of the CAMERA2 trial, demographic-related, infection-related and treatment-related risk factors were assessed for their relationship with acute kidney injury by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Acute kidney injury was defined by a modified-KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria (not including urinary output).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 266 participants included, age (p = 0.04), randomisation to combination therapy (p = 0.002), vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve (p = 0.03) and receipt of (flu)cloxacillin as the companion beta-lactam (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with acute kidney injury. On a multivariable analysis, concurrent use of (flu)cloxacillin increased the risk of acute kidney injury over four times compared with the use of cefazolin or no beta-lactam. The association of vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve with acute kidney injury also persisted in the multivariable model.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      For participants receiving vancomycin for S. aureus bacteraemia, use of (flu)cloxacillin and increased vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve were risk factors for acute kidney injury. These represent potentially modifiable risk factors for nephrotoxicity and highlight the importance of avoiding the use of concurrent nephrotoxins."
Impact of Sodium Thiosulfate on Prevention of Nephrotoxicities in HIPEC: An Ancillary Evaluation of Cisplatin-Induced Toxicities in Ovarian Cancer.,"Rosemary N Senguttuvan, Nicole Lugo Santiago, Ernest S Han, Byrne Lee, Stephen Lee, Wei-Chien Lin, Mehdi Kebria, Amy Hakim, Jeff F Lin, Mark T Wakabayashi, Nora Ruel, Raechelle Tinsley, Melissa Eng, Daphne B Stewart, Edward W Wang, Benjamin I Paz, Xiwei Wu, Hyejin Cho, Winnie S Liang, Lorna Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Mihaela C Cristea, Mustafa Raoof, Thanh H Dellinger, Rosemary N Senguttuvanet al.",2023 Dec,Ann Surg Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37710139/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with cisplatin confers a survival benefit in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) but is associated with renal toxicity. Sodium thiosulfate (ST) is used for nephroprotection for HIPEC with cisplatin, but standard HIPEC practices vary.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective, nonrandomized, clinical trial evaluated safety outcomes of HIPEC with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 during cytoreductive surgery (CRS) in patients with EOC (n = 34) and endometrial cancer (n = 6). Twenty-one patients received no ST (nST), and 19 received ST. Adverse events (AEs) were reported according to CTCAE v.5.0. Serum creatinine (Cr) was collected preoperatively and postoperatively (Days 5-8). Progression-free survival (PFS) was followed. Normal peritoneum was biopsied before and after HIPEC for whole transcriptomic sequencing to identify RNAseq signatures correlating with AEs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty patients had HIPEC at the time of interval or secondary CRS. Renal toxicities in the nST group were 33% any grade AE and 9% grade 3 AEs. The ST group demonstrated no renal AEs. Median postoperative Cr in the nST group was 1.1 mg/dL and 0.5 mg/dL in the ST group (p = 0.0001). Median change in Cr from preoperative to postoperative levels were + 53% (nST) compared with - 9.6% (ST) (p = 0.003). PFS did not differ between the ST and nST groups in primary or recurrent EOC patients. Renal AEs were associated with downregulation of metabolic pathways and upregulation of immune pathways.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      ST significantly reduces acute renal toxicity associated with HIPEC with cisplatin in ovarian cancer patients. As nephrotoxicity is high in HIPEC with cisplatin, nephroprotective agents should be considered."

      Terlipressin improves renal function in patients with septic shock. However, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of terlipressin on renal perfusion in patients with septic shock.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This pilot study enrolled patients with septic shock in the intensive care unit of the tertiary hospital from September 2019 to May 2020. We randomly assigned patients to terlipressin and usual care groups using a 1:1 ratio. Terlipressin was intravenously pumped at a rate of 1.3 μg/kg/hour for 24 h. We monitored renal perfusion using renal contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The primary outcome was peak sonographic signal intensity (a renal perfusion parameter monitored by CEUS) at 24 h after enrollment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      22 patients were enrolled in this study with 10 in the terlipressin group and 12 in the usual care group. The baseline characteristics of patients between the two groups were comparable. The peak sonographic signal intensity at 24 h after enrollment in the terlipressin group (60.5 ± 8.6 dB) was significantly higher than that in the usual care group (52.4 ± 7.0 dB; mean difference, 7.1 dB; 95% CI, 0.4-13.9; adjusted p = .04). Patients in the terlipressin group had a lower time to peak, heart rates, norepinephrine dose, and a higher stroke volume at 24 h after enrollment. No significant difference in the urine output within 24 h and incidence of acute kidney injury within 28 days was found between the two groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Terlipressin improves renal perfusion, increases stroke volume, and decreases norepinephrine dose and heart rates in patients with septic shock."
Long-term impact of immediate versus deferred antiretroviral therapy on kidney health in people with HIV.,"Annegret Pelchen-Matthews, Amanda Mocroft, Lene Ryom, Michael J Ross, Shweta Sharma, Steven Coca, Amit Achhra, Elaine Cornell, Russell Tracy, Andrew Phillips, Marta Montero Alonso, Giota Toulomi, Brian K Agan, Nicholas Medland, Christina M Wyatt                              ;, INSIGHT START Study Group, Annegret Pelchen-Matthewset al.",2024 Jul,Kidney Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38697479/,"APOL1, albuminuria, chronic kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate, nephrotoxicity.","People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) nephrotoxicity. Immediate ART initiation reduces mortality and is now the standard of care, but the long-term impact of prolonged ART exposure on CKD is unknown. To evaluate this, the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) trial randomized 4,684 ART-naïve adults with CD4 cell count under 500 cells/mm3 to immediate versus deferred ART. We previously reported a small but statistically significantly greater decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over a median of 2.1 years in participants randomized to deferred versus immediate ART. Here, we compare the incidence of CKD events and changes in eGFR and urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) in participants randomized to immediate versus deferred ART during extended follow-up. Over a median of 9.3 years, eight participants experienced kidney failure or kidney-related death, three in the immediate and five in the deferred ART arms, respectively. Over a median of five years of more comprehensive follow-up, the annual rate of eGFR decline was 1.19 mL/min/1.73m2/year, with no significant difference between treatment arms (difference deferred - immediate arm 0.055; 95% confidence interval -0.106, 0.217 mL/min/1.73m2). Results were similar in models adjusted for baseline covariates associated with CKD, including UACR and APOL1 genotype. Similarly, there was no significant difference between treatment arms in incidence of confirmed UACR 30 mg/g or more (odds ratio 1.13; 95% confidence interval 0.85, 1.51). Thus, our findings provide the most definitive evidence to date in support of the long-term safety of early ART with respect to kidney health."
"Atezolizumab plus modified docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil as first-line treatment for advanced anal cancer (SCARCE C17-02 PRODIGE 60): a randomised, non-comparative, phase 2 study.","Stefano Kim, Francois Ghiringhelli, Christelle de la Fouchardière, Ludovic Evesque, Denis Smith, Nicolas Badet, Emmanuelle Samalin, Daniel Lopez-Trabada Ataz, Aurelie Parzy, Jérôme Desramé, Nabil Baba Hamed, Bruno Buecher, David Tougeron, Olivier Bouché, Laetitia Dahan, Benoist Chibaudel, Farid El Hajbi, Laurent Mineur, Olivier Dubreuil, Meher Ben Abdelghani, Solange Pecout, Frederic Bibeau, Michael Herfs, Marie-Line Garcia, Aurelia Meurisse, Dewi Vernerey, Julien Taïeb, Christophe Borg, Stefano Kimet al.",2024 Apr,Lancet Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38547895/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The modified docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (mDCF) regimen has shown efficacy and safety as first-line treatment for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the anus, making it a standard regimen. Inhibitors of programmed cell death protein 1 and its ligand, such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, retifanlimab, avelumab, and atezolizumab, have shown some antitumour activity as monotherapy in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the anus that is refractory to chemotherapy. This phase 2 study evaluated the combination of mDCF and atezolizumab as first-line treatment in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the anus.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomised, open-label, non-comparative, phase 2 study, participants from 21 centres (academic, private, and community hospitals and cancer research centres) across France with chemo-naive, metastatic, or unresectable locally advanced recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the anus, aged 18 years or older, and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, were randomly allocated (2:1) to receive either atezolizumab (800 mg intravenously every 2 weeks up to 1 year) plus mDCF (eight cycles of 40 mg per m2 docetaxel and 40 mg per m2 cisplatin on day 1 and 1200 mg per m2 per day of fluorouracil for 2 days, every 2 weeks intravenously; group A) or mDCF alone (group B). Randomisation was done centrally using a minimisation technique and was stratified by age (<65 years vs ≥65 years) and disease status. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed 12-month progression-free survival in the modified intention-to-treat population in group A (35% for the null hypothesis and 50% for the alternative hypothesis). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03519295, and is closed to new participants.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      97 evaluable participants (64 in group A and 33 in group B) were enrolled between July 3, 2018, and Aug 19, 2020. The median follow-up was 26·5 months (95% CI 24·8-28·4). The median age of participants was 64·1 years (IQR 56·2-71·6), and 71 (73%) were female. 12-month progression-free survival was 45% (90% CI 35-55) in group A and 43% (29-58) in group B. In participants with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 5 or greater, 12-month progression-free survival was 70% (95% CI 47-100) in group A and 40% (19-85) in group B (interaction p=0·051) Both groups showed high compliance. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were observed in 39 (61%) participants in group A and 14 (42%) in group B. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (nine [14%] participants in group A vs five [15%] in group B), anaemia (nine [14%] vs one [3%]), fatigue (three [5%] vs four [12%]), and diarrhoea (seven [11%] vs one [3%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 (25%) participants in group A and four (12%) in group B, and these were mDCF-related in seven (11%) participants in group A and four (12%) in group B. Atezolizumab-related serious adverse events occurred in nine (14%) participants in group A, including grade 2 infusion-related reaction in three (5%), grade 3 infection in two (3%), and grade 2 colitis, grade 3 acute kidney injury, grade 3 sarcoidosis, and a grade 4 platelet count decrease each in one participant (2%). There were no treatment-related deaths.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Despite a higher incidence of adverse events, combining atezolizumab with mDCF is feasible, with similar dose intensity in both groups, although the primary efficacy endpoint was not met. The predictive value of a PD-L1 combined positive score of 5 or greater now needs to be confirmed in future studies.

Acute kidney injury during colistin therapy: a prospective study in patients with extensively-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections.,"E Durante-Mangoni, R Andini, S Signoriello, G Cavezza, P Murino, S Buono, M De Cristofaro, C Taglialatela, M Bassetti, P Malacarne, N Petrosillo, A Corcione, C Viscoli, R Utili, C Gallo, E Durante-Mangoniet al.",2016 Dec,Clin Microbiol Infect,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27545697/,"Acinetobacter baumannii, Colistin, Extensively-drug-resistant, Nephrotoxicity, Nosocomial infection, Risk factors.","The study aimed to prospectively assess incidence and risk factors for colistin-associated nephrotoxicity. This is a secondary analysis of a multicentre, randomized clinical trial, comparing efficacy and safety of colistin versus the combination of colistin plus rifampicin in severe infections due to extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. The primary end point was acute kidney injury (AKI) during colistin treatment, assessed using the AKI Network Criteria, and considering death as a competing risk. A total of 166 adult patients without baseline kidney disease on renal replacement therapy were studied. All had life-threatening infections due to colistin-susceptible XDR A. baumannii. Patients received colistin intravenously at the same initial dose (2 million international units (MIU) every 8 h) with predefined dose adjustments according to the actual renal function. Serum creatinine was measured at baseline and at days 4, 7, 11, 14 and 21 (or last day of therapy when discontinued earlier). Outcomes assessed were 'time to any kidney injury' (AKI stages 1-3) and 'time to severe kidney injury' (considering only AKI stages 2-3 as events). When evaluating overall mortality, AKI occurrence was modelled as a time-dependent variable. AKI was observed in 84 patients (50.6%, stage 1 in 40.4%), with an incidence rate of 5/100 person-days (95% CI 4-6.2). Risk estimates of AKI at 7 and 14 days were 30.6% and 58.8%. Age and previous chronic kidney disease were significantly associated with any AKI in multivariable analysis. Neither 'any' nor 'severe AKI' were associated with on-treatment mortality (p 0.32 and p 0.54, respectively). AKI occurs in one-third to one-half of colistin-treated patients and is more likely in elderly patients and in patients with kidney disease. As no impact of colistin-associated AKI on mortality was found, this adverse event should not represent a reason for withholding colistin therapy, whenever indicated."
Lung ultrasound-guided fluid resuscitation in neonatal septic shock: A randomized controlled trial.,"Dabin Huang, Chuming You, Xiaowei Mai, Lin Li, Qiong Meng, Zhenyu Liang, Dabin Huanget al.",2024 Mar,Eur J Pediatr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38095714/,No keywords found,"This randomized controlled trial aimed to determine whether lung ultrasound-guided fluid resuscitation improves the clinical outcomes of neonates with septic shock. Seventy-two patients were randomly assigned to undergo treatment with lung ultrasound-guided fluid resuscitation (LUGFR), or with usual fluid resuscitation (Control) in the first 6 h since the start of the sepsis treatment. The primary study outcome was 14-day mortality after randomization. Fourteen-day mortalities in the two groups were not significantly different (LUGFR group, 13.89%; control group, 16.67%; p = 0.76; hazard ratio 0.81 [95% CI 0.27-2.50]). The LUGFR group experienced shorter length of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stays (21 vs. 26 days, p = 0.04) and hospital stays (32 vs. 39 days, p = 0.01), and less fluid was used in the first 6 h (77 vs. 106 mL/kg, p = 0.02). Further, our study found that ultrasound-guided fluid resuscitation can significantly reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury (25% vs. 47.2%, p = 0.05) and intracranial hemorrhage (grades I-II) within 72 h (13.9% vs. 36.1%, p = 0.03). However, no significant difference was found in the resolution of shock within 1 h or 6 h, use of mechanical ventilation or vasopressor support, time to achieve lactate level < 2 mmol/L, and the number of participants developing hepatomegaly in the first 6 h.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Lung ultrasound is a noninvasive and convenient tool for predicting fluid overload in neonatal septic shock. Fluid resuscitation guided by lung ultrasound can shorten the length of hospital and NICU stays, reduce the amount of fluid used in the first 6 h, and reduce the risk of acute kidney injury and intracranial hemorrhage.

Safety of Eplerenone for Kidney-Transplant Recipients with Impaired Renal Function and Receiving Cyclosporine A.,"Jean-Philippe Bertocchio, Coralie Barbe, Sylvie Lavaud, Olivier Toupance, Pierre Nazeyrollas, Frederic Jaisser, Philippe Rieu, Jean-Philippe Bertocchioet al.",2016 Apr 18,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27088859/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Animal studies have highlighted the role of vascular mineralocorticoid receptor during Cyclosporine A-induced nephrotoxicity. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists could improve kidney survival but are not commonly used during renal impairment and in association with several immunosuppressive drugs due to a supposed higher risk of adverse events. We tested the tolerance of eplerenone according to its expected adverse events: hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, acute kidney failure, or any other adverse event.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a single-center, prospective, open-label study in 31 kidney-transplant recipients with impaired renal function (30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2) and receiving cyclosporine A. All patients received eplerenone 25 mg/d for 8 weeks. Serum potassium, renal function and expected adverse events were closely monitored.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight patients experienced mild hyperkalemia (>5 mmol/L), one moderate hyperkalemia (>5.5 mmol/L) and had to receive potassium-exchange resin. No severe hyperkalemia (>6 mmol/L) occurred. One acute kidney failure was observed, secondary to diarrhea. Basal serum potassium and bicarbonate were independently associated with a higher risk of developing mild hyperkalemia (>5 mmol/L) under treatment (OR 6.5, p = 0.003 and 0.7, p = 0.007, respectively). A cut-off value of 4.35 mmol/L for basal serum potassium was the best factor to predict the risk of developing mild hyperkalemia (>5 mmol/L).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Until eGFR falls to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, eplerenone could be safely given to kidney-transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine A, if kalemia is closely monitored. When renal function is impaired and if basal kalemia is >4.35 mmol/L, then clinicians should properly balance risk and benefit of eplerenone use and offer dietary advice. An adequately powered prospective randomized study is now needed to test its efficiency (and safety) in this population.

"Aminoglycosides in Critically Ill Septic Patients With Acute Kidney Injury Receiving Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy: A Multicenter, Observational Study.","Alexandre Boyer, Jean-François Timsit, Kada Klouche, Emmanuel Canet, Thuy-Nga Phan, Julien Bohé, Sebastien Rubin, Arthur Orieux, Alexandre Lautrette, Didier Gruson, Bertrand Souweine, Alexandre Boyeret al.",2021 Jun,Clin Ther,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34039478/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Data on aminoglycoside stewardship in critically ill septic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) needing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are scarce. The objectives of the study were to determine, during CRRT, the time window with low likelihood for safe reinjection and the proportion of inappropriate reinjection.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A post hoc observational analysis of a multicenter randomized trial comparing the risk of hemodialysis catheter infection with ethanol lock vs placebo in critically ill patients with AKI was conducted. Eligible patients were adults in intensive care units from 6 French hospitals. Any patient with AKI needing CRRT and receiving an antimicrobial therapy for a septic episode occurring before (≤24 hours) or during CRRT was included. The aminoglycoside orders were left to the physicians' discretion, but high dose once daily was the schedule of aminoglycoside administration.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      A total of 145 septic episodes treated by aminoglycosides were analyzed in patients receiving CRRT. A mean (SD) of 1.6 (0.8) amikacin and 1.8 (1.2) gentamicin administrations per patient were observed. During CRRT, Cmax was 17.3 mg/L (interquartile range, 13.2-22.5 mg/L) for gentamicin and 50 mg/L (interquartile range, 43.7-76.6 mg/L) for amikacin. The plasma drug concentration at 24 hours (CH24) was 2.3 mg/L (interquartile range, 1.6-3.2 mg/L) for gentamicin and 9.3 (interquartile range, 6.6-12.0 mg/L) for amikacin. Sixty-five Cmin dosages remained above the reinjection threshold. Inappropriate reinjection was observed in 11 of 65 episodes (17%). Inappropriate reinjection (defined by, at the reinjection time, Cmin dosages above the threshold; ie, Cmin >2 mg/L for gentamicin and >5 mg/L for amikacin) was observed in 17% of analyzed episodes. Most patients did not need reinjection until approximately ≥30 hours after their initial administration.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      During CRRT, as indicated by the CH24 value, which was higher than the recommended threshold, the interval to obtain a Cmin low enough to allow for redosing aminoglycosides is significantly longer than 24 hours. This interval is not always respected and leads to an of inappropriate reinjection rate of 17%. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: ISRCTNCT00875069."

      Dapagliflozin was shown to reduce the cardiovascular (CV) and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, data are limited on the relationship of the effect and safety with the concurrent use of CV medications in patients with type 2 diabetes.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess whether the cardiorenal efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin were consistent with and without background use of CV medications commonly used for heart failure (HF) and kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This study is a prespecified secondary analysis of DECLARE-TIMI 58, which was a randomized trial of dapagliflozin vs placebo in 17 160 patients with type 2 diabetes and either atherosclerotic disease or multiple risk factors for CV disease. Patients were stratified by baseline use of the following CV medications: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEI/ARBs), β-blockers, diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). The study was conducted from May 2013 to September 2018, and data were evaluated for this analysis from February 2021 to May 2022.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Dapagliflozin or placebo.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The outcomes of interest were the composite of CV death or hospitalization for HF (HHF), HHF alone, and a kidney-specific composite outcome (persistent ≥40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], end-stage kidney disease, or kidney-related death).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 17 160 patients, 13 950 (81%) used ACEI/ARBs, 9030 (53%) used β-blockers, 6205 (36%) used diuretics, and 762 (4%) used MRAs at baseline. Changes in blood pressure and eGFR at 48 months with dapagliflozin compared with placebo did not differ regardless of concurrent therapy (placebo-corrected change, -1.6 mm Hg [95% CI, -4.2 to 1.0] to -2.6 mm Hg [95% CI, -3.3 to -2.9]; P > .05 for each interaction). Dapagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of CV death/HHF, HHF alone, and the kidney-specific composite outcome regardless of background use of selected medications (hazard ratio [HR] range: HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39-0.63; to HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95; P > .05 for each interaction). In patients receiving ACEI/ARBs + β-blockers + diuretics (n = 4243), dapagliflozin reduced the risk of CV death/HHF and of the kidney-specific outcome by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93) and 38% (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.87), respectively. There were no significant treatment interactions with the concomitant CV medications for adverse events of volume depletion, acute kidney injury, or hyperkalemia (range: HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.99; to HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.32; P > .05 for each interaction).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Dapagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of CV and kidney outcomes irrespective of background use of various CV medications without any treatment interaction for key safety events. These data show the clinical benefit and safety of dapagliflozin in a broad range of patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of background therapy.

Effect of Saline vs Gluconate/Acetate-Buffered Solution vs Lactate-Buffered Solution on Serum Chloride Among Children in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: The SPLYT-P Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Sainath Raman, Kristen S Gibbons, Adrian Mattke, Andreas Schibler, Peter Trnka, Melanie Kennedy, Renate Le Marsney, Luregn J Schlapbach, Sainath Ramanet al.",2023 Feb 1,JAMA Pediatr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36534387/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Most children admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) receive intravenous fluids. A recent systematic review suggested mortality benefit in critically ill adults treated with balanced solutions compared with sodium chloride, 0.9% (saline). There is a lack of clinically directive data on optimal fluid choice in critically ill children.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine if balanced solutions decrease the rise of plasma chloride compared with saline, 0.9%, in critically ill children.

      This single-center, 3-arm, open-label randomized clinical trial took place in a 36-bed PICU. Children younger than 16 years admitted to the PICU and considered to require intravenous fluid therapy by the treating clinician were eligible.

          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was an increase in serum chloride of 5 mEq/L or more within 48 hours from randomization. New-onset acute kidney injury, length of hospital and intensive care stay, and intensive care-free survival were secondary outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 516 patients with a median (IQR) age of 3.8 (1.0-10.4) years were randomized with 178, 171, and 167 allocated to gluconate/acetate-buffered solution, lactate-buffered solution, and saline, respectively. The serum chloride level increased 5 mEq/L or more in 37 patients (25.2%), 34 patients (23.9%), and 58 patients (40.0%) in the gluconate/acetate-buffered solution, lactate-buffered solution, and saline groups. The odds of a rise in plasma chloride 5 mEq/L or more was halved with the use of gluconate/acetate-buffered solution compared with saline (odds ratio, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.31-0.83]; P = .007) and with the use of lactate-buffered solution compared with saline (odds ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.28-0.79]; P = .004). New-onset acute kidney injury was observed in 10 patients (6.1%), 6 patients (3.7%), and 5 patients (3.2%) in the gluconate/acetate-buffered solution, lactate-buffered solution, and saline groups, respectively.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Balanced solutions (gluconate/acetate-buffered solution and lactate-buffered solution) administered as intravenous fluid therapy reduced the incidence of rise in plasma chloride compared with saline in children in PICU.

Effect of acute kidney injury and overall survival in patients with postoperative head and neck cancer who received chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin: A supplementary analysis of the phase II/III trial of JCOG1008.,"Yoshinori Imamura, Naomi Kiyota, Makoto Tahara, Takeshi Kodaira, Ryuichi Hayashi, Hiroshi Nishino, Yukinori Asada, Hiroki Mitani, Shigemichi Iwae, Naoki Nishio, Yusuke Onozawa, Nobuhiro Hanai, Akira Ohkoshi, Hiroki Hara, Nobuya Monden, Masato Nagaoka, Shujiro Minami, Ryo Kitabayashi, Keita Sasaki, Akihiro Homma                              ;, Head and Neck Cancer Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG‐HNCSG), Yoshinori Imamuraet al.",2024 Sep,Cancer Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39348265/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      In a randomized phase II/III trial (JCOG1008), weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2) was non-inferior to 3-weekly cisplatin (100 mg/m2) for postoperative high-risk head and neck cancer. We investigated how acute kidney injury (AKI), a major dose-limiting toxicity effect of cisplatin, affects overall survival (OS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We analyzed 251 patients from JCOG1008 receiving chemoradiotherapy. AKI was defined based on AKI Network criteria (serum creatinine increase of ≥0.3 mg/dL or ≥1.5-fold [≥ stage I]) within 30 days after completing chemoradiotherapy. OS in the two arms was compared according to AKI development using the log-rank test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total incidence of AKI was lower in the weekly arm than in the 3-weekly arm (38/122 [31.1%] vs. 56/129 [43.4%]). Additionally, stage II/III AKI occurred less frequently in the weekly arm than in the 3-weekly arm (8/122 [6.6%] vs. 19/129 [14.7%]). Cisplatin doses were similar in the weekly arm for patients with and without AKI (median, 238.6 mg/m2 vs. 239.2 mg/m2; p = 0.94), but lower in the 3-weekly arm for those who developed AKI (median, 276.3 mg/m2 vs. 297.4 mg/m2; p = 0.007). In the weekly arm, there was no difference in OS between patients with and without AKI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 2.10). However, in the 3-weekly arm, patients with AKI had poorer OS than those without AKI (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.21).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this supplementary analysis of JCOG1008 data, AKI impacted the OS of patients with head and neck cancer undergoing postoperative chemoradiotherapy in the 3-weekly arm but not in the weekly arm. Our results further endorse the utilization of weekly cisplatin at 40 mg/m2 in this setting."
Acute Kidney Injury in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Patients Receiving Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam Versus Vancomycin and Cefepime.,"Amber B Clemmons, Christine F Bech, Jeremy Pantin, Imran Ahmad, Amber B Clemmonset al.",2018 Apr,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29292056/,"Acute kidney injury, Antimicrobial, Cefepime, Hematopoietic cell transplantation, Piperacillin/tazobactam, Vancomycin.","Empiric antimicrobials are frequently utilized in the pre-engraftment phase after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Recent evidence suggests an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) from combination of vancomycin with piperacillin/tazobactam; however, this has not specifically been evaluated in the HCT population. A single-center, retrospective review was conducted from 2011 to 2017 on 110 autologous and 60 allogeneic HCT patients with the primary objective of comparing incidence of AKI for those who received vancomycin with piperacillin/tazobactam versus vancomycin with cefepime in the pre-engraftment phase. Demographics and outcomes were compared for all patients who received vancomycin with piperacillin/tazobactam versus vancomycin with cefepime as well as within the autologous and allogeneic subgroups. The primary endpoint of incidence of AKI, defined as increase in serum creatinine by .3 mg/dL or >50% from baseline (whichever was larger), was significantly higher for those who received vancomycin with piperacillin/tazobactam versus cefepime for the overall cohort (68% versus 27%; P < .001) resulting in an odds ratio (OR) of 5.16 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 10.5) when adjusting for hypotension. Results were similar within the autologous (59% versus 22%; P < .001; OR, 4.63; 95% CI, 1.85 to 11.6) and allogeneic (79% versus 39%; P= .0021; OR, 5.41; 95% CI, 1.60 to 18.3) subgroups. Within the overall cohort between those who received vancomycin with piperacillin/tazobactam versus cefepime the time to onset of AKI was more commonly within 48 hours of concomitant antimicrobial use (53% versus 26%; P= .012), whereas resolution of AKI by discharge date was not different (39% versus 26%; P= .23). No difference in percentage of patients requiring at least 1 session of dialysis, duration of hospital stay, or 30-day mortality was found between overall cohorts. Further studies of HCT patients are warranted to fully elucidate the risk of various combination antimicrobial regimens on renal outcomes."
Efficacy of Cochleated Amphotericin B in Mouse and Human Mucocutaneous Candidiasis.,"Jigar V Desai#, Amanda Urban#, Doris Z Swaim, Benjamin Colton, Lilian W Kibathi, Elise M N Ferrè, Pamela Stratton, Melissa A Merideth, Sally Hunsberger, Theresa Matkovits, Raphael Mannino, Steven M Holland, Edmund Tramont, Michail S Lionakis#, Alexandra F Freeman#, Jigar V Desaiet al.",2022 Jul 19,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35699443/,"amphotericin B, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, cochleated, mouse model, mucosal candidiasis, phase 2 trial.","Candida albicans causes debilitating, often azole-resistant, infections in patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). Amphotericin B (AMB) resistance is rare, but AMB use is limited by parenteral administration and nephrotoxicity. In this study, we evaluated cochleated AMB (CAMB), a new oral AMB formulation, in mouse models of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and in patients with azole-resistant CMC. OPC and VVC were modeled in Act1-/- mice, and mucosal tissue fungal burden was assessed after once-daily treatment with CAMB, vehicle, or AMB-deoxycholate (AMB-d). Four patients with azole-resistant CMC enrolled in a phase 2 CAMB dose-escalation study. The primary endpoint was clinical improvement at 2 weeks followed by optional extension for long-term CMC suppression to assess safety and efficacy. CAMB-treated mice had significantly reduced tongue and vaginal fungal burdens compared to vehicle-treated mice and exhibited comparable fungal burden reduction relative to AMB-d-treated mice. All CAMB-treated patients reached clinical efficacy by 2 weeks, three at 400 mg twice daily and one at 200 mg twice-daily dosing. All patients continued to the extension phase, with three having sustained clinical improvement of OPC and esophageal candidiasis (EC) for up to 60 months. One patient had a relapse of esophageal symptoms at week 24 and was withdrawn from further study. Clinical responses were not seen for onychomycosis or VVC. CAMB was safe and well-tolerated, without any evidence of nephrotoxicity. In summary, oral CAMB reduced tongue and vaginal fungal burdens during murine candidiasis. A proof-of-concept clinical trial in human CMC showed efficacy with good tolerability and safety. This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT02629419."

      To compare the nephrotoxic effects of iodixanol and iopamidol in patients undergoing peripheral angiography.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients scheduled for peripheral angiography were randomly assigned to the iodixanol group (n = 463) and iopamidol group (n = 458). The primary endpoint was the incidence of contrast associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI), which was defined as an increase ≥ 25% or ≥ 44.2 µmol/l (0.5 mg/dl) in serum creatinine (SCr) from baseline within 72 h after receiving contrast media (CM). The secondary endpoints were the mean peak SCr increase within 72 h after receiving CM and major adverse renal events (SCr increased by two times after 30 days, the need for dialysis treatment, rehospitalization for acute renal failure, or kidney-related death) during hospitalization and within 30 day postdischarge.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of CA-AKI did not differ significantly between the iodixanol group and iopamidol group (18.1% vs. 16.8%; p = 0.595). There was no significant difference in the mean peak SCr increase between the iodixanol group and iopamidol group (10.4 ± 13.0 vs. 10.6 ± 14.3 µmol/l, p = 0.919). There were four patients [1 (0.2%) patient in the iodixanol group and 1 (0.7%) patients in the iopamidol group, p = 0.609] with doubling of SCr; no other adverse renal events were observed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our data showed that the nephrotoxicity of iodixanol was comparable with that of iopamidol in patients undergoing peripheral angiography."
0.9% saline versus Plasma-Lyte as initial fluid in children with diabetic ketoacidosis (SPinK trial): a double-blind randomized controlled trial.,"Vijai Williams, Muralidharan Jayashree, Karthi Nallasamy, Devi Dayal, Amit Rawat, Vijai Williamset al.",2020 Jan 2,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898531/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication encountered during the course of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Plasma-Lyte with lower chloride concentration than saline has been shown to be associated with reduced incidence of AKI in adults with septic shock. No study has compared this in DKA.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This double-blind, parallel-arm, investigator-initiated, randomized controlled trial compared 0.9% saline with Plasma-Lyte-A as initial fluid in pediatric DKA. The study was done in a tertiary care, teaching, and referral hospital in India in children (> 1 month-12 years) with DKA as defined by ISPAD. Children with cerebral edema or known chronic kidney/liver disease or who had received pre-referral fluids and/or insulin were excluded. Sixty-six children were randomized to receive either Plasma-Lyte (n = 34) or 0.9% saline (n = 32).
    


          Main outcomes:
        
      
      Primary outcome was incidence of new or progressive AKI, defined as a composite outcome of change in creatinine (defined by KDIGO), estimated creatinine clearance (defined by p-RIFLE), and NGAL levels. The secondary outcomes were resolution of AKI, time to resolution of DKA (pH > 7.3, bicarbonate> 15 mEq/L & normal sensorium), change in chloride, pH and bicarbonate levels, proportion of in-hospital all-cause mortality, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and length of ICU and hospital stay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. The incidence of new or progressive AKI was similar in both [Plasma-Lyte 13 (38.2%) versus 0.9% saline 15 (46.9%); adjusted OR 1.22; 95% CI 0.43-3.43, p = 0.70]. The median (IQR) time to resolution of DKA in Plasma-Lyte-A and 0.9% saline were 14.5 (12 to 20) and 16 (8 to 20) h respectively. Time to resolution of AKI was similar in both [Plasma-Lyte 22.1 versus 0.9% saline 18.8 h (adjusted HR 1.72; 95% CI 0.83-3.57; p = 0.14)]. Length of hospital stay was also similar in both [Plasma-Lyte 9 (8 to 12) versus 0.9% saline 10 (8.25 to 11) days; p = 0.39].
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The incidence of new or progressive AKI and resolution of AKI were similar in both groups. Plasma-Lyte-A was similar to 0.9% Saline in time to resolution of DKA, need for RRT, mortality, and lengths of PICU and hospital stay.

      Dengue induced acute kidney injury (AKI) imposes heavy burden of illness in terms of morbidity and mortality. A retrospective study was conducted to investigate incidence, characteristics, risk factors and clinical outcomes of AKI among dengue patients.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      A total 667 dengue patients (2008-2013) were retrospectively evaluated and were stratified into AKI and non-AKI groups by using AKIN criteria. Two groups were compared by using appropriate statistical methods.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 95 patients (14.2%) who had AKI, with AKIN-I, AKIN-II and AKIN-III in 76.8%, 16.8% and 6.4% patients, respectively. Significant differences (P<0.05) in demographics and clinico-laboratory characteristics were observed between patients with and without AKI. Presence of dengue hemorrhagic fever [OR (95% CI): 8.0 (3.64–17.59), P<0.001],rhabdomyolysis [OR (95% CI): 7.9 (3.04–20.49)], multiple organ dysfunction OR (95% CI):17.9 (9.14–35.12), P<0.001], diabetes mellitus [OR (95% CI): 4.7 (1.12–19.86), P = 0.034], late hospitalization [OR (95% CI): 2.1 (1.12–19.86), P = 0.033] and use of nephrotoxic drugs [OR(95% CI): 2.9 (1.12–19.86), P = 0.006] were associated with AKI. Longer hospital stay (>3days) was also observed among AKI patients (OR = 1.3, P = 0.044) [corrected].Additionally, 48.4% AKI patients had renal insufficiencies at discharge that were signicantly associated with severe dengue, secondary infection and diabetes mellitus. Overall mortality was 1.2% and all fatal cases had AKI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The incidence of AKI is high at 14.2% among dengue patients, and those with AKI portended significant morbidity, mortality, longer hospital stay and poor renal outcomes. Our findings suggest that AKI in dengue is likely to increase healthcare burden that underscores the need of clinicians' alertness to this highly morbid and potentially fatal complication for optimal prevention and management."

      High dose methotrexate (HDMTX) acute kidney injury (AKI) results in prolonged hospitalization and treatment delays. Using a pharmacologically-based approach, HDMTX was administered with standard combination therapy to patients with osteosarcoma; nephrotoxicity was assessed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients were randomized by cycle to 4 h or 12 h HDMTX (12 g/m2) infusions administered with hydration, alkalization and leucovorin rescue. Urinalysis, AKI biomarkers, and estimated glomerular filtration rate using serum creatinine or cystatin C (GFRCr or GFRcysC) were obtained. Serum and urine methotrexate concentrations [MTX] were measured.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients (n = 12), median (range) age 12.4 (5.7-19.2) years were enrolled; 73 MTX infusions were analyzed. Median (95% Confidence Interval) serum and urine [MTX] were 1309 (1190, 1400) µM and 16.4 (14.7, 19.4) mM at the end of 4 h infusion and 557 (493, 586) µM and 11.1 (9.9, 21.1) mM at the end of 12 h infusion. Time to serum [MTX] < 0.1 µM was 83 (80.7, 90.7) h and 87 (82.8, 92.4) h for 4 and 12 h infusions. GFRCr was highly variable, increased after cisplatin, and exceeded 150 ml/min/1.73 m2. GFRcysC was less variable and decreased at the end of therapy. AKI biomarkers were elevated indicating acute tubular dysfunction, however, did not differ between 4 and 12 h infusions. Radiographic and histological response were similar for patients receiving 4 h or 12 h infusions; the median percent tumor necrosis was > 95%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Reducing peak serum and urine MTX concentration by prolonging the infusion duration did not alter risk of acute kidney injury. GFRcysC was decreased at the end of therapy. Proteinuria and elevations in AKI biomarkers indicate that direct tubular damage contributes to HDMTX nephrotoxicity.

Temporal Trajectory of Systolic Blood Pressure and Outcomes in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage: ATACH-2 Trial Cohort.,"Kanta Tanaka, Masatoshi Koga, Mayumi Fukuda-Doi, Adnan I Qureshi, Haruko Yamamoto, Kaori Miwa, Masafumi Ihara, Kazunori Toyoda                              ;, ATACH- Trial Investigators, Kanta Tanakaet al.",2022 Jun,Stroke,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35400202/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      To highlight the heterogeneity of acute temporal blood pressure (BP) changes in the ATACH-2 trial (Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage-2) and associations with the outcomes of intracerebral hemorrhage.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One thousand patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage, who had been randomized to intensive (110-139 mm Hg) or standard (140-179 mm Hg) systolic BP (SBP) lowering with intravenous nicardipine in ATACH-2 from 2011 to 2015, were analyzed about temporal changes in hourly maximum SBP up to 24 hours after randomization using group-based trajectory modeling. Outcomes included death or disability (modified Rankin Scale score 4-6) at 3 months, neurological deterioration within 24 hours (≥2-point decrease in Glasgow Coma Scale score or ≥4-point increase in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), and acute kidney injury (≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or ≥1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine) within 7 days after onset.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Group-based trajectory modeling revealed 4 SBP trajectory groups: moderate SBP (from ≈190 mm Hg at hospital arrival to 150-160 mm Hg after randomization; n=298), moderate-to-low SBP (from ≈190 mm Hg to <140 mm Hg; n=395), high-to-low SBP (from >210 mm Hg to <140 mm Hg; n=134), and high SBP (from >210 mm Hg to 160-170 mm Hg; n=173). Patients with intensive treatment accounted for 11.1%, 88.6%, 85.1%, and 1.7% of each group, respectively. Compared with the moderate-to-low SBP group, the high-to-low SBP group showed increased risks of death or disability at 3 months (adjusted odds ratio, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.24-4.26]) and acute kidney injury (adjusted odds ratio, 3.50 [95% CI, 1.83-6.69]), while no increase in neurological deterioration was seen in this group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.20-1.13]). The moderate SBP and high SBP groups showed no significant risk differences for such outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Data-driven observation using a group-based trajectory modeling approach may be useful to clarify the relationship between antihypertensive treatment, temporal SBP changes, and outcomes in acute intracerebral hemorrhage.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors predict acute kidney injury during chemoradiation for head and neck cancer.,"Michael T Spiotto, Hongyuan Cao, Loren Mell, F Gary Toback, Michael T Spiottoet al.",2015 Mar,Anticancer Drugs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25486599/,No keywords found,"Head and neck cancer patients undergoing chemoradiation experience considerable toxicities including acute kidney injury (AKI). However, it remains unclear what factors predispose patients to renal toxicity during treatment. Here, we assessed the predictors and outcomes of patients experiencing AKI during chemoradiation. We carried out a retrospective cohort study to assess the maximum changes in serum creatinine (Cr) in 173 patients with stage III-IV head and neck cancer treated with chemoradiation between 1999 and 2012. We defined AKI as Cr increases 26.5 µmol/l or more over the pretreatment baseline. AKI was associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use (33.0 vs. 11.0%; P=0.0004), but no other medications or comorbidities. On multivariate analysis, ACEI use, weight loss 10% or more of body weight, and performance status 70 or more predicted for Cr increments 26.5 µmol/l or more, whereas only ACEI use predicted for Cr increments of 44.2 µmol/l or greater. Furthermore, on multivariate analysis, AKI predicted for more interventions during radiotherapy including intravenous fluid use (P=0.0005) and hospitalizations (P=0.007), as well as long-term renal dysfunction (P<0.0001). Renal toxicity was not associated with worse locoregional control, progression-free survival, or overall survival. Renal toxicity during chemoradiation was associated with ACEI use alone or coupled with weight loss 10% or more of body weight during therapy. Our results suggest that actively managing ACEI use and intravascular volume status during chemoradiation may avoid AKI, minimize subsequent interventions, and reduce the risk for long-term renal dysfunction."
Propranolol vs. band ligation for primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a randomized controlled trial.,"Virendra Singh#, Pramod Kumar#, Nipun Verma, Rajesh Vijayvergiya, Akash Singh, Ashish Bhalla, Virendra Singhet al.",2022 Aug,Hepatol Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35672572/,No keywords found,"Background and aims:
        
      
      Recent studies have debated the utility of beta-blockers to prevent variceal hemorrhage (V.H.) in cirrhosis patients with ascites. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of propranolol (PPL) compared to endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) for V.H. primary prevention in patients with ascites.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Cirrhosis patients with ≥ grade 2 ascites and varices needing primary prophylaxis were randomly assigned to receive either PPL (n = 80) or EVL (n = 80). Patients were followed monthly until 12 months or transplant or death. The primary endpoint was 12-month transplant-free-survival (TFS). Secondary endpoints were the incidence of V.H., acute kidney injury (AKI), and control of ascites.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. PPL-group had a lower 12-month TFS (76.0% vs. 89.7%; p = 0.02) as compared with EVL-group. Mean arterial pressure ≤ 82 mmHg and MELD-sodium were the independent predictors of mortality. Incidence of VH was comparable between PPL and EVL-groups [6 (7.5%) vs. 2 (2.5%), p = 0.13]. In PPL vs. EVL-group, more patients had worsening of ascites (15% vs. 5%; p = 0.03), developed refractory ascites (13.7% vs.3.7%; p = 0.02), relapse of ascites (37.1% vs. 16.4%, p < 0.01), and AKI (26.2% vs. 12.5%; p = 0.02). Side effects were comparable between the two groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Primary VH-prophylaxis with PPL is associated with lower survival, poor control of ascites, and increased risk of AKI in cirrhosis patients with ≥ grade 2 ascites. PPL and EVL are equally effective in preventing V.H. Serial monitoring of blood pressures and renal functions is needed in cirrhosis patients with ascites on PPL (NCT02649335)."
Prospective comparison of the effects of intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy and restrictive fluid therapy on complications in thoracoscopic lobectomy.,"Min Li, Mingqing Peng, Min Liet al.",2021 Dec,J Int Med Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34918965/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      Restrictive fluid therapy is recommended in thoracoscopic lobectomy to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, but it may contribute to hypovolemia. Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) regulates fluid infusion to an amount required to avoid dehydration. We compared the effects of GDFT versus restrictive fluid therapy on postoperative complications after thoracoscopic lobectomy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In total, 124 patients who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy were randomized into the GDFT group (group G, n = 62) or restrictive fluid therapy group (group R, n = 62). The fluid volume and postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total fluid volume in groups G and R was 1332 ± 364 and 1178 ± 278 mL, respectively. Group R received a smaller colloid fluid volume (523 ± 120 vs. 686 ± 180 mL), had a smaller urine output (448 ± 98 vs. 491 ± 101 mL), and received more norepinephrine (120 ± 66 vs. 4 ± 18 µg) than group G. However, there were no significant differences in postoperative pulmonary complications, acute kidney injury, length of hospital stay, or in-hospital mortality between the two groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Restrictive fluid therapy performs similarly to GDFT in thoracoscopic lobectomy but is a simpler fluid strategy than GDFT.Trial registration: This study has been registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100051339) (http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx)."
The CARDINAL Trial of Bardoxolone Methyl in Alport Syndrome: When Marketing Interests Prevail over Patients Clinical Needs.,"Piero Ruggenenti, Piero Ruggenenti.",2023,Nephron,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36731435/,"Alport syndrome, Bardoxolone, CARDINAL trial, Heart failure, Liver toxicity, Nephrotoxicity.","Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary chronic kidney disease (CKD) with X-linked, autosomal, and digenic patterns of transmission. Sieving dysfunction of the glomerular basement membrane caused by congenitally defective type IV collagen results in persistent proteinuria, hematuria, and progressive renal dysfunction. There are no disease-specific medications and treatment is based on conservative interventions in particular with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) inhibitors. Subject of Review: Evidence that AS is accompanied by glomerular and tubular inflammatory changes and that bardoxolone methyl exerts anti-inflammatory effects through suppression of NF-kB and activation of transcription of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes, provided a justification for the CARDINAL study, a prospective, randomized controlled trial testing the potential renoprotective effect of bardoxolone methyl in 157 adolescent or adult patients with AS. The authors concluded that bardoxolone methyl preserved estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) relative to placebo at 48 and 100 weeks after randomization. However, exactly the same number of patients (n = 3) in each group developed kidney failure. Second Opinion: Despite alarming safety signals from previous trials in type 2 diabetics with CKD (increased hospitalizations for heart failure, fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, liver toxicity, and increased blood pressure and albuminuria), major marketing interests encouraged the drug manufacturer to pursue this line of research. Finding that type IV collagen gene mutations account for nearly one-third of cases of hereditary glomerulopathies implies that the population of potential target-patients could probably be much larger than estimated. Moreover, any new medication approved for AS might receive orphan drug designation which might be associated with shortened time to approval, monetary benefits, and a period of market exclusivity. In actual facts, CARDINAL failed to demonstrate any nephro-protective effect of bardoxolone methyl and found an increase in liver enzymes in 70 of the 77 (90.9%) bardoxolone-treated patients consistent with chronic liver toxicity. Indeed, in Zucker diabetic fatty rats treated with an analog of bardoxolone methyl, elevations of liver aminotransferases were associated with enhanced liver weight, severe and diffuse hepatocyte vacuolization, swelling, and degeneration. Moreover, bardoxolone-induced increase in eGFR was associated with a concomitant increase in geometric mean urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, a finding consistent with worsening glomerular hyperfiltration. Considering also the consequent increase in the biomechanical strain on the fragile Alport glomerular basement membrane, this hemodynamic effect is expected to translate into accelerated renal disease progression (consistently with evidence that a bardoxolone methyl analog worsened proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubular damage in Zucker diabetic fatty rats). These concerns induced the Food and Drug Administration to reject the new drug application for bardoxolone methyl submitted by Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. with the proposed indication to slow CKD progression in AS patients 12 years of age and older. Thus, bardoxolone methyl is devoid of any nephro-protective effect and is associated with significant heart, liver, and renal toxicity in patients with CKD, including those with AS. Because of these safety signals, it should not be used in this clinical context. Research programs could explore the potential clinical applications, even outside the kidney field, of novel NF erythroid 2-like 2 modulators devoid of bardoxolone methyl toxicity."
Evaluation of Renal Toxicity of Colistin Therapy With Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin: a Biomarker of Renal Tubular Damage.,"Atefeh Ordooei Javan, Jamshid Salamzadeh, Shervin Shokouhi, Zahra Sahraei, Atefeh Ordooei Javanet al.",2017 Nov,Iran J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29190605/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Nephrotoxicity has been a concern with new dosing regimens of colistin. This study was designed to compare nephrotoxicity of high dose and conventional dose of colistin and the ability of detecting it using neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A randomized clinical trial was carried out on 40 patients with multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections assigned into 2 groups to receive high and conventional doses of colistin. Blood samples were taken 4 times for measuring serum NGAL. The incidence of acute kidney injury was also evaluated based on the risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage renal disease (RIFLE) criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline levels of NGAL were not significantly different between the patients on the high dose and conventional dose of colistin. The mean NGAL levels on day 10 were 762.14 ± 415.44 pg/mL and 623.67 ± 272.61 pg/mL, respectively. However, between-group analysis did not show a significant difference in the NGAL levels. The prevalence of acute kidney injury was 60% and 15% based on the RIFLE criteria, in the high-dose and conventional-dose groups, respectively (P = .003).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although colistin-induced nephrotoxicity was not confirmed with NGAL levels, our findings, however, showed a higher incidence of acute kidney injury associated with high-dose colistin, defined by the RIFLE criteria. Higher levels of NGAL in the acute kidney injury patients were associated with high-dose regimen of colistin."
Urinary kidney injury molecule-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 are noninvasive biomarkers of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in lung cancer patients.,"Haruka Shinke, Satohiro Masuda, Yousuke Togashi, Yasuaki Ikemi, Aiko Ozawa, Tomoko Sato, Young Hak Kim, Michiaki Mishima, Takaharu Ichimura, Joseph V Bonventre, Kazuo Matsubara, Haruka Shinkeet al.",2015 Nov,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26407820/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious adverse effect of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, traditional markers of kidney function, such as serum creatinine, are suboptimal, because they are not sensitive measures of proximal tubular injury. We aimed to determine whether the new urinary biomarkers such as kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) could detect cisplatin-induced AKI in lung cancer patients in comparison with the conventional urinary proteins such as N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and β2-microglobulin.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We measured KIM-1, MCP-1, NGAL, NAG, and β2-microglobulin concentrations in urine samples from 11 lung cancer patients, which were collected the day before cisplatin administration and on days 3, 7, and 14. Subsequently, we evaluated these biomarkers by comparing their concentrations in 30 AKI positive (+) and 12 AKI negative (-) samples and performing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The urinary levels normalized with urine creatinine of KIM-1 and MCP-1, but not NGAL, NAG, and β2-microglobulin in AKI (+) samples were significantly higher than those in AKI (-) samples. In addition, ROC curve analyses revealed that KIM-1 and MCP-1, but not NGAL, could detect AKI with high accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.858, 0.850, and 0.608, respectively). The combination of KIM-1 and MCP-1 outperformed either biomarker alone (AUC = 0.871).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Urinary KIM-1 and MCP-1, either alone or in combination, may represent biomarkers of cisplatin-induced AKI in lung cancer patients."

We evaluated the effect of terminal complement blockade with the anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab on biomarkers of cellular processes involved in TMA in patients with aHUS longitudinally, during up to 1 year of treatment, compared with in healthy volunteers. Biomarker levels were elevated at baseline in most patients, regardless of mutational status, plasma exchange/infusion use, platelet count, or lactate dehydrogenase or haptoglobin levels. Eculizumab reduced terminal complement activation (C5a and sC5b-9) and renal injury markers (clusterin, cystatin-C, β2-microglobulin, and liver fatty acid binding protein-1) to healthy volunteer levels and reduced inflammation (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1), coagulation (prothrombin fragment F1+2 and d-dimer), and endothelial damage (thrombomodulin) markers to near-normal levels. Alternative pathway activation (Ba) and endothelial activation markers (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) decreased but remained elevated, reflecting ongoing complement activation in aHUS despite complete terminal complement blockade. These results highlight links between terminal complement activation and inflammation, endothelial damage, thrombosis, and renal injury and underscore ongoing risk for systemic TMA and progression to organ damage. Further research regarding underlying complement dysregulation is warranted. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01194973."
Association of Acute Kidney Injury with Cardiovascular Events and Death in Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.,"Brad P Dieter, Kenn B Daratha, Sterling M McPherson, Robert Short, Radica Z Alicic, Katherine R Tuttle, Brad P Dieteret al.",2019,Am J Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30939480/,No keywords found,"Rationale and objective:
        
      
      In the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, the possible relationships between acute kidney injury (AKI) and risk of major cardiovascular events and death are not known.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Post hoc analysis of a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial.
    


          Setting and participants:
        
      
      Hypertensive adults without diabetes who were ≥50 years of age with prior cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), 10-year Framingham risk score > 15%, or age > 75 years were assigned to a systolic blood pressure target of < 120 mm Hg (intensive) or < 140 mm Hg (standard).
    


          Predictor:
        
      
      AKI episodes.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, decompensated heart failure, or cardiovascular death. The secondary outcome was death from any cause. Analytical Approach: AKI was defined using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes modified criteria based solely upon serum creatinine. AKI episodes were identified by serious adverse events or emergency room visits. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the risk for the primary and secondary outcomes by AKI status.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants were 68 ± 9 years of age, 36% women (3,332/9,361), and 30% Black race (2,802/9,361), and 17% (1,562/9,361) with cardiovascular disease. Systolic blood pressure was 140 ± 16 mm Hg at study entry. AKI occurred in 4.4% (204/4,678) and 2.6% (120/4,683) in the intensive and standard treatment groups respectively (p < 0.001). Those who experienced AKI had higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.20, p = 0.026) and death from any cause (HR 2.33, 95% CI 1.56-3.48, p < 0.001) controlling for age, sex, race, baseline systolic blood pressure, body mass index, number of antihypertensive medications, cardiovascular disease and CKD status, hypotensive episodes, and treatment assignment.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      The study was not prospectively designed to determine relationships between AKI, cardiovascular events, and death.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among older adults with hypertension at high cardiovascular risk, intensive treatment of blood pressure independently increased risk of AKI, which substantially raised risks of major cardiovascular events and death."
Isotonic balanced fluid versus 0.9% saline in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: A double-blinded randomised controlled trial.,"Khadijah Poh, Aida Bustam, Mohd Shahnaz Hasan, Nor'azim Mohd Yunos, Chun Yoong Cham, Fang Jen Lim, Ahmad Zulkarnain Ahmad Zahedi, Aliyah Zambri, Muhaimin Noor Azhar, Khadijah Pohet al.",2024 Mar:77:106-114.,Am J Emerg Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38118385/,No keywords found,"Background and importance:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health concern with significant economic impact. Optimal fluid therapy aims to restore intravascular volume, maintain cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow, thus preventing secondary brain injury. While 0.9% saline (NS) is commonly used, concerns about acid-base and electrolyte imbalance and development of acute kidney injury (AKI) lead to consideration of balanced fluids as an alternative.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study aimed to compare the outcomes of patients with moderate to severe TBI treated with Sterofundin (SF) versus NS.
    


          Design, settings and participants:
        
      
      A double-blinded randomised controlled trial of patients aged 18 to 65 years with TBI was conducted at the University Malaya Medical Centre from February 2017 to November 2019.
    


          Intervention or exposure:
        
      
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive either NS or SF. The study fluids were administered for 72 h as continuous infusions or boluses. Participants, investigators, and staff were blinded to the fluid type.
    


          Outcomes measure and analysis:
        
      
      The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      A total of 70 patients were included in the analysis, with 38 in the NS group and 32 in the SF group. The in-hospital mortality rate were 3 (7.9%) in the NS group vs. 4 (12.5%) in the SF group, RR = 1.29 (95% CI, 0.64 to 2.59; p = 0.695). No patients developed AKI and required renal replacement therapy. ICP on day 3 was significantly higher in the SF group (18.60 ± 9.26) compared to 12.77 ± 3.63 in the NS group, (95% CI, -11.46 to 0.20; p = 0.037). There were no significant differences in 3-day biochemical parameters and cerebral perfusion pressure, ventilator-free days, length of ICU stay, or Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score at 6 months.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with moderate to severe TBI, the use of SF was not associated with reduced in-hospital mortality, development of AKI, or improved 6-month GOS-E when compared to NS."
Early Versus Standard Initiation of Terlipressin for Acute Kidney Injury in ACLF: A Randomized Controlled Trial (eTerli Study).,"Ankur Jindal, Hitesh Singh, Guresh Kumar, Vinod Arora, Manoj Kumar Sharma, Rakhi Maiwall, V Rajan, Harsh Vardhan Tewathia, Chitranshu Vasishtha, Shiv Kumar Sarin, Ankur Jindalet al.",2024 Jun,Dig Dis Sci,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38637454/,No keywords found,"Background and aims:
        
      
      Terlipressin infusion is effective in hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI). However, its efficacy for HRS-AKI resolution in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients has been suboptimal. Progression of AKI is rapid in ACLF. We investigated whether early initiation of terlipressin(eTerli) can improve response rates.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Consecutive ACLF patients with stage II/III AKI despite albumin resuscitation (40 g) were randomized to receive terlipressin at 2 mg/24 h plus albumin at 12 h (ET, n = 35) or at 48 h as standard therapy (ST, n = 35). (June 22, 2020 to June 10, 2022). The primary end-point was AKI reversal by day7.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline parameters including AKI stage and ACLF-AARC scores in two arms were comparable. Full AKI response at day 7 was higher in ET [24/35 (68.6%)] than ST arm [11/35 (31.4%; P 0.03]. Day3 AKI response was also higher in ET arm [11/35 (31.4%) vs. 4/35 (11.4%), P 0.04]. Using ST compared to ET [HR 4.3; P 0.026] and day 3 serum creatinine > 1.6 mg/dl [HR 9.1; AUROC-0.866; P < 0.001] predicted HRS-AKI non-response at day 7. ET patients showed greater improvement in ACLF grade, mean arterial pressure, and urine output at day 3, and required lower albumin within 7 days than ET arm (149.1 ± 41.8 g vs. 177.5 ± 40.3 g, P 0.006) and had lower 28-day mortality: 40% vs. 65.7%, P 0.031]. Early use of terlipressin than ST [HR 2.079; P 0.038], baseline HE [HR 2.929; P 0.018], and AKI persistence at day 3 [HR 1.369; P 0.011] predicted 28-day mortality. Fifteen (21.4%) patients had treatment related adverse effects, none was life threatening.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In ACLF patients, early initiation of terlipressin for AKI persisting after 12 h of volume expansion with albumin helps in reduced short-term mortality and early AKI reversal with regression of ACLF stage. These results indicate need for change in current practice for terlipressin usage in HRS-AKI."

Methods: A total of 128 patients with sepsis who met the entry criteria in multiple centers were randomly divided into experimental (intravenous vitamin B 6 therapy) and control (intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride therapy) groups based on usual care. Clinical data, the inflammatory response indicators interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and endothelin-1 (ET-1), the oxidative stress response indicators superoxide dismutase, glutathione and malondialdehyde, and renal function (assessed by blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and renal resistance index monitored by ultrasound) were compared between the two groups. Results: After 7 d of treatment, the IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and ET-1 levels in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group, the oxidative stress response indicators were significantly improved in the experimental group and the blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and renal resistance index values in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group ( P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in the rate of renal replacement therapy and 28 d mortality ( P > 0.05). However, the intensive care unit length of stay and the total hospitalization expenses in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group ( P < 0.05). Conclusion: The administration of vitamin B 6 in the treatment of patients with sepsis attenuates renal injury, and the mechanism may be related to pyridoxine decreasing the levels of inflammatory mediators and their regulation by redox stress."
A Phase I Study of Capivasertib in Combination With Abiraterone Acetate in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"Neal Shore, Begoña Mellado, Satish Shah, Ralph Hauke, Dan Costin, Nabil Adra, Marie Cullberg, Carlos Fernandez Teruel, Thomas Morris, Neal Shoreet al.",2023 Apr,Clin Genitourin Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36572571/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Although androgen receptor-targeted agents prolong the lives of patients with metastatic prostate cancer, patients develop therapy resistance and most ultimately succumb to the disease. The PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway has been associated with the development of resistance, raising the possibility that pathway inhibitors may produce a clinical benefit. This open-label phase Ib study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary clinical activity of adding capivasertib - a potent, selective inhibitor of AKT1/2/3 - to approved abiraterone acetate therapy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-seven patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had undergone at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy received abiraterone acetate 1000 mg (orally administered once daily), plus oral prednisone 5 mg (twice daily) with capivasertib 400 mg (orally, twice daily, with an intermittent schedule of 4 days on, 3 days off).
    


          Results:
        
      
      No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. The most frequent adverse events (all grade) were diarrhea (30%), anemia (26%), asthenia (22%), and nausea (22%). The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events were acute kidney injury (19%), hyperglycemia (7%), rash (7%), abdominal pain (7%), and asthenia (7%). Capivasertib and abiraterone PK were consistent with previously reported results from monotherapy dosing. Nine participants (33%) showed a 20% or greater decrease in prostate-specific antigen during study treatment.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The combination of capivasertib and abiraterone acetate had an acceptable tolerability profile consistent with the known profile of each agent. These data support further evaluation of capivasertib and abiraterone acetate in patients with advanced prostate cancer."

      The feasibility and clinical outcomes of conservative fluid management after sepsis resuscitation remain unknown.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To evaluate the effect of a conservative fluid management protocol on fluid balance and intensive care unit (ICU)-free days among patients with sepsis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a single-center phase II/III randomized trial, we enrolled adults with suspected infection, ≥2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, and either shock (mean arterial pressure <60 mm Hg or vasopressors) or respiratory insufficiency (mechanical ventilation or oxygen saturation <97% and fraction of inspired oxygen ≥0.3). Patients were randomized 1:1 to usual care or a conservative fluid management protocol. The protocol restricted intravenous fluid administration during shock to treatment of oliguria or increasing vasopressor requirement. In the absence of shock, loop diuretic infusion targeted equal fluid input and output each study day. The primary outcomes were mean daily fluid balance (phase II) and ICU-free days (phase III).
    


          Results:
        
      
      At the completion of phase II (n = 30), the difference in mean daily fluid balance between groups (-398 mL) was less than the prespecified threshold (-500 mL) and the trial was stopped. Patients in the conservative fluid management (n = 15) and usual care (n = 15) groups experienced similar cumulative fluid input (8450 mL vs 7049 mL; P = .90) of which only 14% was intravenous crystalloid or colloid. Loop diuretic infusion occurred more frequently in the conservative fluid management group (40% vs 0%; P = .02), and cumulative fluid output was 10 645 mL in the conservative fluid management group compared to 6286 mL in the usual care group (P = .39). Hemodynamic, respiratory, and renal function did not differ between the groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this phase II trial, a conservative fluid management protocol did not decrease mean daily fluid balance by more than 500 mL among patients with sepsis.

Primary outcome was 12-month overall survival in patients who received at least one cycle of intervention. Secondary outcomes were mobilization of CD34+ cells at day 6, improvement in Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), liver stiffness measurement, quality of life, nutrition, hepatic decompensation, infection, hospitalization, and acute kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Survival in group A was higher than that in Group B although the difference was not statistically significant (87.9% vs 66.7%; p = 0.053). CD34+ cells at day 6 were significantly higher in group A as compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Ascites control (p = 0.03) and CTP score improvement (p = 0.02) were better in group A at 12-months. Encephalopathy episodes (p = 0.005), infections (p = 0.005) were fewer in group A than group B at 12 months. Other secondary outcomes did not improve post-therapy. There were no treatment-related discontinuations or severe adverse events.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      G-CSF therapy is safe. The improvement in survival at 12 months is not statistically significant. Better control of ascites, improvement of CTP score, fewer encephalopathy episodes and decreased rate of infections were observed with G-CSF therapy (NCT03911037). Trials Registration NCT03911037."
Oral hydration compared to intravenous hydration in the prevention of post-contrast acute kidney injury in patients with chronic kidney disease stage IIIb: A phase III non-inferiority study (NICIR study).,"Carmen Sebastià, Alfredo Páez-Carpio, Elena Guillen, Blanca Paño, David Garcia-Cinca, Esteban Poch, Laura Oleaga, Carlos Nicolau, Carmen Sebastiàet al.",2021 Mar:136:109509.,Eur J Radiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33516141/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the non-inferiority of oral hydration compared to intravenous (i.v.) hydration in the prevention of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) in patients with stage IIIb chronic kidney disease (CKD) referred for an elective contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT).
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      This is a prospective, randomized, phase 3, parallel-group, open-label, non-inferiority trial. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive prophylaxis against PC-AKI either with oral hydration: 500 mL of water two hours before and 2000 mL during the 24 h after performing CE-CT or i.v. hydration: sodium bicarbonate (166 mmol/L) 3 mL/kg/h starting one hour before and sodium bicarbonate (166 mmol/L) 1 mL/kg/h during the first hour after CE-CT. 100 mL of non-ionic iodinated contrast was administered in all cases. The primary outcome was the proportion of PC-AKI in the first 48-72 h after CE-CT. Secondary outcomes were persistent PC-AKI, the need for hemodialysis, and the occurrence of adverse events related to prophylaxis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 264 patients randomized between January 2018 and January 2019, 114 received oral hydration, and 114 received i.v. hydration and were evaluable. No significant differences were found (p > 0.05) between arms in clinical characteristics or risk factors. PC-AKI rate was 4.4 % (95 %CI: 1.4-9.9 %) in the oral hydration arm and 5.3 % (95 %CI: 2.0-11.1%) in the i.v. hydration arm. The persistent PC-AKI rate was 1.8 % (95 %CI: 0.2-6.2 %) in both arms. No patient required dialysis during the first month after CE-CT or had adverse effects related to the hydration regime.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In those with stage IIIb CKD referred for an elective CE-CT, we provide evidence of non-inferiority of oral hydration compared to i.v. hydration in the prevention of PC-AKI."
Dexmedetomidine pretreatment attenuates myocardial ischemia reperfusion induced acute kidney injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress in human and rat.,"Chaoliang Tang, Yida Hu, Jie Gao, Jiazhen Jiang, Si Shi, Jiawu Wang, Qingtian Geng, Xinghan Liang, Xiaoqing Chai, Chaoliang Tanget al.",2020 Sep 15:257:118004.,Life Sci,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32621918/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) often develop acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MI/R), and this renal injury can be resolved notably by dexmedetomidine. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was reported to get involved in organ injury including AKI.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The current study aimed to address the correlation between MI/R induced AKI with ER stress and to assess the effects of dexmedetomidine pretreatment on AKI protection.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Patients selected for heart valve replacement surgery were randomly assigned to NS group (pre-anesthesia with 0.9% NaCl) and DEX group (pre-anesthesia with dexmedetomidine). Rat MI/R model was induced by occluding coronary artery for 30 min followed by 48-hour reperfusion. Rats were randomized into Sham (0.9% NaCl), I/R (MI/R + 0.9% NaCl) and I/R + DEX (MI/R + dexmedetomidine). Organ function and ER stress condition were evaluated by blood chemistry, pathology, and molecular test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Clinical data indicated dexmedetomidine pretreatment attenuated AKI and oxidative stress as well as postischemic myocardial injury in patients. Accordingly animal results suggested dexmedetomidine reduced cellular injury and improved postischemic myocardial and renal function. Dexmedetomidine also reduced myocardial and renal cells apoptosis and down-regulated ER stress.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results suggested that dexmedetomidine pretreatment attenuates MI/R injury-induced AKI by relieving the ER stress."
Everolimus for the Prevention of Calcineurin-Inhibitor-Induced Left Ventricular Hypertrophy After Heart Transplantation (RADTAC Study).,"Chris Anthony, Muhammad Imran, Jim Pouliopoulos, Sam Emmanuel, James W Iliff, Kirsten J Moffat, Joanne Ross, Robert M Graham, Eugene Kotlyar, Kavitha Muthiah, Anne M Keogh, Christopher S Hayward, Peter Macdonald, Andrew Jabbour, Chris Anthonyet al.",2021 Apr,JACC Heart Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795116/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      This study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of combined low-dose everolimus and low-dose tacrolimus compared with standard-dose tacrolimus in attenuating left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT).
    


          Background:
        
      
      Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as tactrolimus are important in preventing cardiac allograft rejection and reducing mortality after OHT. However CNIs are causatively linked to the development of LVH, and are associated with nephrotoxicity and vasculopathy. CNI-sparing agents such as everolimus have been hypothesized to inhibit adverse effects of CNIs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective, randomized, open-label study, OHT recipients were randomized at 12 weeks after OHT to a combination of low-dose everolimus and tacrolimus (the RADTAC group) or standard-dose tacrolimus (the TAC group), with both groups coadministered mycophenolate and prednisolone. The primary endpoint was LVH indexed as the change in left ventricular mass (ΔLVM) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging from 12 to 52 weeks. Secondary endpoints included CMR-based myocardial performance, T1 fibrosis mapping, blood pressure, and renal function. Safety endpoints included episodes of allograft rejection and infection.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty stable OHT recipients were randomized. Recipients in the RADTAC group had significantly lower tacrolimus levels compared with the TAC group (6.5 ± 3.5 μg/l vs. 8.6 ± 2.8 μg/l; p = 0.02). The mean everolimus level in the RADTAC group was 4.2 ± 1.7 μg/l. A significant reduction in LVM was observed in the RADTAC group compared with an increase in LVM in the TAC group (ΔLVM = -13.0 ± 16.8 g vs. 2.1 ± 8.4 g; p < 0.001). Significant differences were also noted in secondary endpoints measuring function and fibrosis (Δ circumferential strain = -2.9 ± 2.8 vs. 2.1 ± 2.3; p < 0.001; ΔT1 mapping values = -32.7 ± 51.3 ms vs. 26.3 ± 90.4 ms; p = 0.003). No significant differences were observed in blood pressure (Δ mean arterial pressure = 4.2 ± 18.8 mm Hg vs. 2.8 ± 13.8 mm Hg; p = 0.77), renal function (Δ creatinine = 3.1 ± 19.9 μmol/l vs. 9 ± 21.8 μmol/l; p = 0.31), frequency of rejection episodes (p = 0.69), or frequency of infections (p = 0.67) between groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The combination of low-dose everolimus and tacrolimus compared with standard-dose tacrolimus safely attenuates LVH in the first year after cardiac transplantation with an observed reduction in CMR-measured fibrosis and an improvement in myocardial strain."
Medication Intervention for Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Transitioning from Hospital to Home: Study Design and Baseline Characteristics.,"Radica Z Alicic, Robert A Short, Cynthia L Corbett, Joshua J Neumiller, Brian J Gates, Kenn B Daratha, Celestina Barbosa-Leiker, Sterling McPherson, Naomi S Chaytor, Brad P Dieter, Stephen M Setter, Katherine R Tuttle, Radica Z Alicicet al.",2016,Am J Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27487357/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The hospital readmission rate in the population with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high and strategies to reduce this risk are urgently needed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The CKD-Medication Intervention Trial (CKD-MIT; www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCTO1459770) is a single-blind (investigators), randomized, clinical trial conducted at Providence Health Care in Spokane, Washington. Study participants are hospitalized patients with CKD stages 3-5 (not treated with kidney replacement therapy) and acute illness. The study intervention is a pharmacist-led, home-based, medication management intervention delivered within 7 days after hospital discharge. The primary outcome is a composite of hospital readmissions and visits to emergency departments and urgent care centers for 90 days following hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes are achievements of guideline-based targets for CKD risk factors and complications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Enrollment began in February 2012 and ended in May 2015. At baseline, the age of participants was 69 ± 11 years (mean ± SD), 50% (77 of 155) were women, 83% (117 of 141) had hypertension and 56% (79 of 141) had diabetes. At baseline, the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 41 ± 14 ml/min/1.73 m2 and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 43 mg/g (interquartile range 8-528 mg/g). The most frequent diagnosis category for the index hospital admission was cardiovascular diseases at 34% (53 of 155), but the most common single diagnosis for admission was community-acquired acute kidney injury at 10% (16 of 155).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Participants in CKD-MIT are typical of acutely ill hospitalized patients with CKD. A medication management intervention after hospital discharge is under study to reduce post-hospitalization acute care utilization and to improve CKD management."
Hypertonic Mannitol for the Prevention of Intradialytic Hypotension: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Finnian R Mc Causland, Brian Claggett, Venkata S Sabbisetti, Petr Jarolim, Sushrut S Waikar, Finnian R Mc Causlandet al.",2019 Oct,Am J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31040088/,No keywords found,"Rationale & objective:
        
      
      Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a common complication at the initiation of hemodialysis (HD) therapy, is associated with greater mortality, and may be related to relatively rapid shifts in plasma osmolality. This study sought to evaluate the effect of an intervention to minimize intradialytic changes in plasma osmolality on the occurrence of IDH.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Double-blind, single-center, randomized, controlled trial.
    


          Setting & participants:
        
      
      Individuals requiring initiation of HD for acute or chronic kidney disease.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Mannitol, 0.25g/kg/h, versus a similar volume of 0.9% saline solution during the first 3 HD sessions.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      The primary end point was average decline in systolic blood pressure (SBP). The secondary end point was the proportion of total sessions complicated by IDH (defined as a decrease ≥ 20mm Hg from the pre-HD SBP). Exploratory end points included biomarkers of cardiac and kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      52 patients were randomly assigned and contributed to 156 study visits. There were no significant differences in average SBP decline between the mannitol and placebo groups (15±11 vs 19±16mm Hg; P = 0.3). The proportion of total sessions complicated by IDH was lower in the mannitol group compared to placebo (25% vs 43%), with a nominally lower risk for developing an episode of IDH (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-1.00), though this finding was of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.05). There were no consistent differences in cardiac and kidney injury biomarker levels between treatment groups.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Modest sample size and number of events.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this pilot randomized controlled trial studying patients requiring initiation of HD, we found no difference in absolute SBP decline between those who received mannitol and those who received saline solution. However, there were fewer overall IDH events and a nominally lower risk for dialysis sessions being complicated by IDH in the mannitol group. A larger multicenter randomized controlled trial is warranted.

Strategies to Reduce Acute Kidney Injury and Improve Clinical Outcomes Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A Subgroup Analysis of the PRESERVE Trial.,"Santiago Garcia, Deepak L Bhatt, Martin Gallagher, Hani Jneid, James Kaufman, Paul M Palevsky, Hongsheng Wu, Steven D Weisbord                              ;, PRESERVE Trial Group, Santiago Garciaet al.",2018 Nov 26,JACC Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30466822/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to compare intravenous (IV) sodium bicarbonate with IV sodium chloride and oral acetylcysteine with placebo for the prevention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CAAKI) and intermediate-term adverse outcomes.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Data are conflicting on the optimal strategy to reduce CAAKI and related complications after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The PRESERVE (Prevention of Serious Adverse Events Following Angiography) trial used a 2 × 2 factorial design to randomize 5,177 patients with stage III or IV chronic kidney disease undergoing angiography to IV 1.26% sodium bicarbonate or IV 0.9% sodium chloride and 5 days of oral acetylcysteine or placebo. A subgroup analysis was conducted of the efficacy of these interventions in patients who underwent PCI during the study angiographic examination. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, need for dialysis, or persistent kidney impairment at 90 days; CAAKI was a secondary endpoint.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1,161 PRESERVE patients (mean age 69 ± 8 years) underwent PCI. The median estimated glomerular filtration rate was 50.7 ml/min/1.73 m2 (interquartile range: 41.7 to 60.1 ml/min/1.73 m2), and 952 patients (82%) had diabetes mellitus. The primary endpoint occurred in 15 of 568 patients (2.6%) in the IV sodium bicarbonate group and 24 of 593 patients (4.0%) in the IV sodium chloride group (odds ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.33 to 1.24; p for interaction = 0.41) and in 23 of 598 patients (3.8%) in the acetylcysteine group and 16 of 563 patients (2.8%) in the placebo group (odds ratio: 1.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.71 to 2.62; p for interaction = 0.29). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of CAAKI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients with CKD undergoing PCI, there was no benefit of IV sodium bicarbonate over IV sodium chloride or of acetylcysteine over placebo for the prevention of CAAKI or intermediate-term adverse outcomes."
HYDration and Bicarbonate to Prevent Acute Renal Injury After Endovascular Aneurysm Repair With Suprarenal Fixation: Pilot/Feasibility Randomised Controlled Study (HYDRA Pilot Trial).,"Athanasios Saratzis, Virginia Chiocchia, Ahmad Jiffry, Neelam Hassanali, Surjeet Singh, Christopher H Imray, Matthew J Bown, Asif Mahmood, Athanasios Saratziset al.",2018 May,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29482973/,No keywords found,"Objective/background:
        
      
      Up to 25% of patients undergoing elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) develop acute kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with short and long-term morbidity and mortality. There is no high quality randomised evidence regarding prevention of EVAR related AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A novel AKI prevention strategy for EVAR was devised, based on best evidence and an expert consensus group. This included a bolus of high dose sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) immediately before EVAR (1 mL/kg of 8.4% NaHCO3) and standardised crystalloid based hydration pre- and post-EVAR. A pilot/feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) was performed in two centres to assess the safety of the intervention, potential impact on AKI prevention, and feasibility of a national RCT; the primary end point was the proportion of eligible patients recruited into the study. AKI was defined using ""Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes"" and ""Acute Kidney Injury Network"" criteria based on National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence AKI recommendations, using serum creatinine and hourly urine output.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-eight patients (84% of those screened; median age 75 years [range 57-89 years], 10% female) were randomised to receive the standardised intravenous hydration with (intervention) or without (control) NaHCO3. Groups were comparable in terms of AKI risk factors; 56 of 58 participants had a device with suprarenal fixation. Overall, 33% of patients in the control arm developed AKI versus 7% in the intervention arm (as treated analysis). None of the patients receiving NaHCO3 developed a serious intervention related adverse event; five patients did not attend their 30 day follow-up.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Bolus high dose NaHCO3 and hydration is a promising EVAR related AKI prevention method. This trial has confirmed the feasibility of delivering a definitive large RCT to confirm the efficacy of this novel intervention, in preventing EVAR related AKI."
"Effects of Monomeric and Oligomeric Flavanols on Kidney Function, Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in Runners: A Randomized Double-Blind Pilot Study.","Khrystyna O Semen, Antje R Weseler, Marcel J W Janssen, Marie-José Drittij-Reijnders, Jos L M L le Noble, Aalt Bast, Khrystyna O Semenet al.",2020 Jun 1,Nutrients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32492913/,"exercise, flavanols, ibuprofen, inflammation, kidney function, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin.","Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are frequently used by athletes in order to prevent musculoskeletal pain and improve performance. In combination with strenuous exercise, they can contribute to a reduction of renal blood flow and promote development of kidney damage. We aimed to investigate whether monomeric and oligomeric flavanols (MOF) could reduce the severity of kidney injuries associated with the intake of 400-mg ibuprofen followed by the completion of a half-marathon in recreational athletes. In this double-blind, randomized study, the original MOF blend of extracts from grape seeds (Vitis vinifera L.) and pine bark (Pinus pinaster L.) or placebo were taken for 14 days preceding the ibuprofen/half-marathon. Urine samples were collected before and after the ibuprofen/half-marathon, and biomarkers of kidney injury, inflammation and oxidative stress were assessed. Intake of MOF significantly reduced the incidence of post-race hematuria (p = 0.0004) and lowered concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 in the urine (p = 0.032). Urinary neutrophil-associated lipocalin, creatine, albumin, IL-8 and malondialdehyde tended to decrease. The supplementation with MOF in recreational runners appears to safely preserve kidney function, reduce inflammation and promote antioxidant defense during strenuous exercise and intake of a single dose of ibuprofen."
Risk factors for acute kidney injury during aminoglycoside therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Kevin J Downes, Neha R Patil, Marepalli B Rao, Rajesh Koralkar, William T Harris, John P Clancy, Stuart L Goldstein, David J Askenazi, Kevin J Downeset al.",2015 Oct,Pediatr Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25912993/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Aminoglycoside (AG) therapy is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with AKI during intravenous AG courses in this population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a matched case-control study utilizing two independent cohorts of hospitalized CF patients receiving ≥ 3 days of intravenous AG at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Children's of Alabama. All admissions with AKI (cases, N = 82) were matched to two randomly selected admissions without AKI (controls, N = 164) by center, gender, and age ±3 years of the case. AKI was defined as a 1.5-fold increase in the baseline serum creatinine (SCr) level or by an increase in SCr level of 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h. Admissions with AKI before day 4 or without at least weekly SCr monitoring were excluded from the analysis. Factors were compared between cases and controls using simple and multiple conditional logistic regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Multivariable analysis identified receipt of an AG within 90 days prior to admission, longer duration of AG therapy, low serum albumin, and receipt of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as independent risk factors for developing AKI. Infection with Staphylococcus aureus diminished the odds of developing AKI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study identifies risk factors contributing to AG-associated AKI in CF patients. These findings can be used to anticipate high-risk scenarios and limit AKI in CF patients under clinical care."
Developmental Pharmacokinetics and Age-Appropriate Dosing Design of Milrinone in Neonates and Infants with Acute Kidney Injury Following Cardiac Surgery.,"Tomoyuki Mizuno, Katja M Gist, Zhiqian Gao, Michael F Wempe, Jeffrey Alten, David S Cooper, Stuart L Goldstein, Alexander A Vinks, Tomoyuki Mizunoet al.",2019 Jun,Clin Pharmacokinet,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30607889/,No keywords found,"Background and objective:
        
      
      Milrinone is used for the prevention of low cardiac output syndrome in pediatric patients after cardiac surgery. Milrinone is mainly eliminated by the kidneys; however, there is limited information on milrinone pharmacokinetics in infants who have acute kidney injury (AKI). The aim of this study was to develop a milrinone population pharmacokinetic model in neonates and infants with or without AKI. The developed milrinone pharmacokinetic model was utilized for a Monte Carlo simulation analysis to identify age-appropriate dosing regimens in neonates and infants.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with a total of 1088 serum milrinone concentrations obtained from 92 infants as part of a prospective clinical study in neonates and infants following cardiac surgery (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01966237). AKI stages were determined based on the Kidney Injury Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline within the first three postoperative days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A two-compartment model was found to adequately describe the pharmacokinetic data. Allometrically scaled body weight, AKI stages, and maturation function were identified as significant predictors of milrinone clearance. The proposed dosing regimens for milrinone continuous infusions were determined based on a target concentration attainment of simulated steady-state concentration and covered three age groups across 0-12 months of age for each AKI stage.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study provides a milrinone population pharmacokinetic model in neonates and infants and captures the developmental changes in clearance. Age-appropriate dosing regimens were determined based on the simulation analysis with the developed pharmacokinetic model. The findings will facilitate model-informed precision dosing of milrinone in infants with or without AKI."

          Measurements:
        
      
      The primary endpoint was the number of patients with AKI defined according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. The secondary endpoint were major adverse cardiac post-operative events (new onset of atrial fibrillation or flutter, low cardiac output syndrome, and in-hospital death). End points were evaluated during the first seven post-operative days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      118 patients were analyzed. In the overall study population, the mean age was 70 (62-76) years, 65% were male and the median EuroSCORE was 7 (5-10). Overall, 46 (39%) patients developed AKI (30 KDIGO 1, 8 KDIGO 2, 8 KDIGO 3), and 6 patients required renal replacement therapy. The incidence of AKI was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (16 patients (27%) vs 30 patients (51%), p = 0.12). Higher dose and longer duration of norepinephrine were associated with AKI severity.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Decreasing norepinephrine exposure by using a dynamic arterial elastance guided norepinephrine weaning strategy was associated with a reduced incidence of acute kidney injury in patients with vasoplegia after cardiac surgery. Further prospective multicentric studies are needed to confirm these results."
Protocol and statistical analysis plan for the REstricted fluid therapy VERsus Standard trEatment in Acute Kidney Injury-REVERSE-AKI randomized controlled pilot trial.,"Suvi T Vaara, Marlies Ostermann, Tuomas Selander, Laurent Bitker, Antoine Schneider, Elettra Poli, Eric Hoste, Michael Joannidis, Alexander Zarbock, Frank van Haren, John Prowle, Ville Pettilä, Rinaldo Bellomo, Suvi T Vaaraet al.",2020 Jul,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32022904/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Fluid accumulation frequently coexists with acute kidney injury (AKI) and is associated with increased risk for AKI progression and mortality. Among septic shock patients, restricted use of resuscitation fluid has been reported to reduce the risk of worsening of AKI. Restrictive fluid therapy, however, has not been studied in the setting of established AKI. Here, we present the protocol and statistical analysis plan of the REstricted fluid therapy VERsus Standard trEatment in Acute Kidney Injury-the REVERSE-AKI trial that compares a restrictive fluid therapy regimen to standard therapy in critically ill patients with AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      REVERSE-AKI is an investigator-initiated, multinational, open-label, randomized, controlled, feasibility pilot trial conducted in seven ICUs in five countries. We aim to randomize 100 critically ill patients with AKI to a restrictive fluid treatment regimen vs standard management. In the restrictive fluid therapy regimen, the daily fluid balance target is neutral or negative. The primary outcome is the cumulative fluid balance assessed after 72 hours from randomization. Secondary outcomes include safety, feasibility, duration, and severity of AKI, and outcome at 90 days (mortality and dialysis dependence).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This is the first multinational trial investigating the feasibility and safety of a restrictive fluid therapy regimen in critically ill patients with AKI.

Effect of N-acetylcysteine against Vancomycin-Induced Nephrotoxicity: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.,"Shirinsadat Badri, Rasool Soltani, Mina Sayadi, Farzin Khorvash, Mohsen Meidani, Shahram Taheri, Shirinsadat Badriet al.",2020 Jun 1,Arch Iran Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32536177/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The proposed mechanism of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity (VIN) is indirect production of reactive oxygen species in the kidney tissue. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an anti-oxidant agent, in the prevention of VIN.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients who received vancomycin for any indication were randomly divided to drug (NAC) and control groups. The patients in the drug group received oral NAC 600 mg every 12 hours for 10 days, starting concurrently with vancomycin. Serum creatinine (SCr) levels and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) as well as creatinine clearance (CrCl) and 12-hour urine volume were recorded at baseline, every other day during the study, and 12 hours after the last dose of vancomycin on the 10th day. Furthermore, the cases of acute kidney injury (AKI; ≥ 0.5 mg/dL or at least 50% increase in serum creatinine from baseline) were recorded in the two groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Over the study period, 84 and 95 patients completed the study in drug and control groups, respectively. SCr and CrCl were significantly lower and higher, respectively, at all-time points (except for baseline) in the NAC compared to the control group. Furthermore, although not statistically significant, 12 cases of vancomycin-induced AKI were observed in the control group (12.63%), while 4 cases (4.76%) were reported from drug group (P = 0.066; relative risk [RR] = 0.377, 95% CI: 0.126-1.124).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      NAC has the potential for reduction of VIN. However, more studies are necessary to confirm this effect."
A Pilot Study Evaluating the Effect of Cooler Dialysate Temperature on Hemodynamic Stability During Prolonged Intermittent Renal Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury.,"Fahad Y Edrees, Sreelatha Katari, Jack D Baty, Anitha Vijayan, Fahad Y Edreeset al.",2019 Feb,Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30394919/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Complications of renal replacement therapy include hemodynamic instability with ensuing shortened treatments, inadequate ultrafiltration, and delay in renal recovery. Studies have shown that lowering dialysate temperature in patients with end-stage renal disease is associated with a decrease in the frequency of intradialytic hypotension. However, data regarding mitigation of hypotension by lowering dialysate temperature in patients with acute kidney injury are scarce. We conducted a prospective, randomized, cross-over pilot study to evaluate the effect of lower dialysate temperature on hemodynamic status of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury during prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Single-center prospective, randomized, cross-over study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      ICUs and a step down unit in a tertiary referral center.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury patients undergoing prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants were randomized to start prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy with dialysate temperature of 35°C or dialysate temperature of 37°C.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      The primary endpoint was the number of hypotensive events, as defined by any of the following: decrease in systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg, decrease in mean arterial pressure greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg, decrease in ultrafiltration, or increase in vasopressor requirements. The number of events was analyzed by Poisson regression and other outcomes with repeated-measures analysis of variance. Twenty-one patients underwent a total of 78 prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy sessions, 39 in each arm. The number of hypotensive events was twice as high during treatments with dialysate temperature of 37°C, compared with treatments with the cooler dialysate (1.49 ± 1.12 vs 0.72 ± 0.69; incidence rate ratio, 2.06; p ≤ 0.0001). Treatment sessions with cooler dialysate were more likely to reach prescribed ultrafiltration targets.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with acute kidney injury undergoing prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy with cooler dialysate experienced significantly less hypotension during treatment. Prevention of hemodynamic instability during renal replacement therapy helped to achieve ultrafiltration goals and may help to prevent volume overload in critically ill patients."
Saline versus Lactated Ringer's Solution: The Saline or Lactated Ringer's (SOLAR) Trial.,"Kamal Maheshwari, Alparslan Turan, Natalya Makarova, Chao Ma, Wael Ali Sakr Esa, Kurt Ruetzler, Sabri Barsoum, Alan G Kuhel, Michael R Ritchey, Carlos Higuera-Rueda, Tatyana Kopyeva, Luca Stocchi, Hani Essber, Barak Cohen, Iman Suleiman, Gausan R Bajracharya, David Chelnick, Edward J Mascha, Andrea Kurz, Daniel I Sessler, Kamal Maheshwariet al.",2020 Apr,Anesthesiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31977517/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Both saline and lactated Ringer's solutions are commonly given to surgical patients. However, hyperchloremic acidosis consequent to saline administration may provoke complications. The authors therefore tested the primary hypothesis that a composite of in-hospital mortality and major postoperative complications is less common in patients given lactated Ringer's solution than normal saline.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The authors conducted an alternating cohort controlled trial in which adults having colorectal and orthopedic surgery were given either lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline in 2-week blocks between September 2015 and August 2018. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality and major postoperative renal, respiratory, infectious, and hemorrhagic complications. The secondary outcome was postoperative acute kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 8,616 qualifying patients, 4,187 (49%) were assigned to lactated Ringer's solution, and 4,429 (51%) were assigned to saline. Each group received a median 1.9 l of fluid. The primary composite of major complications was observed in 5.8% of lactated Ringer's versus 6.1% of normal saline patients, with estimated average relative risk across the components of the composite of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.52; P = 0.261). The secondary outcome, postoperative acute kidney injury, Acute Kidney Injury Network stage I-III versus 0, occurred in 6.6% of lactated Ringer's patients versus 6.2% of normal saline patients, with an estimated relative risk of 1.18 (99.3% CI, 0.99 to 1.41; P = 0.009, significance criterion of 0.007). Absolute differences between the treatment groups for each outcome were less than 0.5%, an amount that is not clinically meaningful.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In elective orthopedic and colorectal surgery patients, there was no clinically meaningful difference in postoperative complications with lactated Ringer's or saline volume replacement. Clinicians can reasonably use either solution intraoperatively."
"Early low-dose erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy and progression of moderate chronic kidney disease: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Danilo Fliser, Frank Dellanna, Michael Koch, Alfons Wiggenhauser                              ;, PRIMAVERA study group, Danilo Fliseret al.",2017 Feb 1,Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28186540/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      It is unknown whether early intervention with low-dose erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in non-anaemic patients delays progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a single-blind, 24-month trial, adults with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2 and either Type 2 diabetes mellitus or previous kidney transplantation were randomized to low-dose continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator (CERA; monthly dose 30–75 µg; n = 115) or placebo (n = 120). The primary endpoint was the annual change in eGFR (abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean (standard deviation) eGFR was 40.7 (9.8) mL/min/1.73 m2 versus 39.8 (9.2) mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline for CERA and placebo, respectively, and 39.0 (11.6) g/dL versus 39.7 (10.6) g/dL at the final visit. The median (interquartile range) annual reduction in eGFR was 0.5 (−2.2, 3.8) mL/min/1.73 m2 with CERA versus 0.4 (−2.0, 3.2) mL/min/1.73 m2 with placebo (P = 0.657). No significant difference in the annual change in eGFR was observed between treatment groups in the subpopulations with Type 2 diabetes or kidney transplant. Adverse events with a suspected relation to study drug occurred in 22.0% and 16.2% of patients randomized to CERA or placebo, respectively, and adverse events led to study drug discontinuation in 11.0% and 8.5% of patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with moderate CKD and Type 2 diabetes or previous kidney transplantation showed stable renal function that was unaffected by administration of low-dose ESA. In addition, there was no clinically meaningful effect of 2-year low-dose ESA treatment on albuminuria, an important surrogate marker of kidney injury."
"The Effect in Renal Function and Vascular Decongestion in Type 1 Cardiorenal Syndrome Treated with Two Strategies of Diuretics, a Pilot Randomized Trial.","Jonathan S Chávez-Iñiguez, Miguel Ibarra-Estrada, Sergio Sánchez-Villaseca, Gregorio Romero-González, Jorge J Font-Yañez, Andrés De la Torre-Quiroga, Andrés Aranda-G de Quevedo, Alexia Romero-Muñóz, Pablo Maggiani-Aguilera, Gael Chávez-Alonso, Juan Gómez-Fregoso, Guillermo García-García, Jonathan S Chávez-Iñiguezet al.",2022 Jan 3,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34979962/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      The main treatment strategy in type 1 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS1) is vascular decongestion. It is probable that sequential blockage of the renal tubule with combined diuretics (CD) will obtain similar benefits compared with stepped-dose furosemide (SF).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a pilot double-blind randomized controlled trial of CRS1 patients were allocated in a 1:1 fashion to SF or CD. The SF group received a continuous infusion of furosemide 100 mg during the first day, with daily incremental doses to 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg. The CD group received a combination of diuretics, including 4 consecutive days of oral chlorthalidone 50 mg, spironolactone 50 mg and infusion of furosemide 100 mg. The objectives were to assess renal function recovery and variables associated with vascular decongestion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From July 2017 to February 2020, 80 patients were randomized, 40 to the SF and 40 to the CD group. Groups were similar at baseline and had several very high-risk features. Their mean age was 59 ± 14.5 years, there were 37 men (46.2%). The primary endpoint occurred in 20% of the SF group and 15.2% of the DC group (p = 0.49). All secondary and exploratory endpoints were similar between groups. Adverse events occurred frequently (85%) with no differences between groups (p = 0.53).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In patients with CRS1 and a high risk of resistance to diuretics, the use of CD compared to SF offers the same results in renal recovery, diuresis, vascular decongestion and adverse events, and it can be considered an alternative treatment.

      The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of renal perfusion with Custodiol (Dr Franz-Kohler Chemie GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) versus enriched Ringer's solution for renal protection in patients undergoing open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ninety consecutive patients scheduled for elective open TAAA repair were enrolled between 2015 and 2017 in a single-center, phase IV, prospective, parallel, randomized, double-blind trial (the CUstodiol versus RInger: whaT Is the Best Agent [CURITIBA] trial), and randomized to renal arteries perfusion with 4°C Custodiol (Dr Franz-Kohler Chemie GmbH, Bensheim, Germany; n = 45) or 4°C lactated Ringer's solution (n = 45). The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing TAAA open surgery using Custodiol renal perfusion versus an enriched Ringer's solution was the primary end point.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ninety patients completed the study (45 patients in each group). The incidence of postoperative AKI was significantly lower in the Custodiol group (48.9% vs 75.6%; P = .02). In the multivariable model, only the use of Custodiol solution resulted as protective from the occurrence of any AKI (odds ratio, 0.230; 95% confidence interval, 0.086-0.614; P = .003), whereas TAAA type II extent was associated with the development of severe AKI (odds ratio, 4.277; 95% confidence interval, 1.239-14.762; P = .02). At 1-year follow-up, serum creatinine was not significantly different from the preoperative values in both groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The use of Custodiol during open TAAA repair was safe and resulted in significantly lower rates of postoperative AKI compared with Ringer's solution. These findings support safety and efficacy of Custodiol in this specific setting, which is currently off-label."
Dose escalation study of intravenous and intra-arterial N-acetylcysteine for the prevention of oto- and nephrotoxicity of cisplatin with a contrast-induced nephropathy model in patients with renal insufficiency.,"Edit Dósa, Krisztina Heltai, Tamás Radovits, Gabriella Molnár, Judit Kapocsi, Béla Merkely, Rongwei Fu, Nancy D Doolittle, Gerda B Tóth, Zachary Urdang, Edward A Neuwelt, Edit Dósaet al.",2017 Oct 3,Fluids Barriers CNS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28974245/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cisplatin neuro-, oto-, and nephrotoxicity are major problems in children with malignant tumors, including medulloblastoma, negatively impacting educational achievement, socioemotional development, and overall quality of life. The blood-labyrinth barrier is somewhat permeable to cisplatin, and sensory hair cells and cochlear supporting cells are highly sensitive to this toxic drug. Several chemoprotective agents such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) were utilized experimentally to avoid these potentially serious and life-long side effects, although no clinical phase I trial was performed before. The purpose of this study was to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics of both intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (IA) NAC in adults with chronic kidney disease to be used in further trials on oto- and nephroprotection in pediatric patients receiving platinum therapy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Due to ethical considerations in pediatric tumor patients, we used a clinical population of adults with non-neoplastic disease. Subjects with stage three or worse renal failure who had any endovascular procedure were enrolled in a prospective, non-randomized, single center trial to determine the MTD for NAC. We initially aimed to evaluate three patients each at 150, 300, 600, 900, and 1200 mg/kg NAC. The MTD was defined as one dose level below the dose producing grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Serum NAC levels were assessed before, 5 and 15 min post NAC. Twenty-eight subjects (15 men; mean age 72.2 ± 6.8 years) received NAC IV (N = 13) or IA (N = 15).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The first participant to experience grade 4 toxicity was at the 600 mg/kg IV dose, at which time the protocol was modified to add an additional dose level of 450 mg/kg NAC. Subsequently, no severe NAC-related toxicity arose and 450 mg/kg NAC was found to be the MTD in both IV and IA groups. Blood levels of NAC showed a linear dose response (p < 0.01). Five min after either IV or IA NAC MTD dose administration, serum NAC levels reached the 2-3 mM concentration which seemed to be nephroprotective in previous preclinical studies.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In adults with kidney impairment, NAC can be safely given both IV and IA at a dose of 450 mg/kg. Additional studies are needed to confirm oto- and nephroprotective properties in the setting of cisplatin treatment. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu .

      Nursing home-associated pneumonia (NHAP) is a common type of infection among long-term care residents. Moreover, the mortality of NHAP is also higher than community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the decoctions of Banxia Houpo Tang (BHT) and Ding Chuan Tang (DCT) are two formulas supporting the lungs' natural defense systems, helps to expel mucus and promote detoxification.
    


          Aim of the study:
        
      
      We designed a concentrated Chinese herbal extract formula called BDT1, that combines the compounds of BHT and DCT. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of BDT1 for NHAP prevention in high-risk older residents in the nursing home.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 160 participants aged over 65 years old living in the nursing home were randomly assigned 1:1 to the BDT1 and placebo group. Besides regular medicine, participants received either BDT1 or a placebo for 12 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome was the hospitalization rate for pneumonia in the intervention period and half-year follow-up. The microscopic examination of Gram-stained sputum was also evaluated before and after the trial. Data were analyzed by using the Chi-square test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test with SPSS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 160 participants were enrolled into two study groups in this study, which was completed with 143 participants analyzed, including 70 subjects in the BDT1 group and 73 subjects in the placebo group. After the 12-week medical treatment, the hospitalization rate for pneumonia was 10.0% and 34.2% in the BDT1 and placebo group respectively. The risk of pneumonia in half a year was lower in the BDT1 group (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.422, 95% CI = 0.226-0.791). Compared to the placebo group, the level of Gram-negative bacilli in the BDT1 group is significantly declined in sputum samples (p < 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In conclusion, the cumulative incidence of pneumonia and related-hospitalization rates declined significantly after 12-weeks of BDT1 treatment. Besides, Chinese herbal medicine BDT1 is a safe therapy without hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity."

      Palliative chemotherapy of advanced oesophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) consists of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (CF) to target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with panitumumab (P); chemotherapy enhanced overall survival (OS) in advanced colorectal or squamous cell head and neck cancers. With prospective serum and tumour biomarkers, we tested if P added to CF (CFP) improved OS in advanced ESCC.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Eligible patients with confirmed ESCC that was not curatively resectable or did not qualify for definitive radiochemotherapy, were randomised 1 : 1 to receive CF [cisplatin (C) 100 mg/m2 i.v., day 1; 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m2 i.v., days 1-4] or CF plus P (9 mg/kg, i.v., day 1, each q3-week cycle) until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Safety was reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board after 40, 70 and 100 patients who completed at least one cycle. After 53 enrolled patients, cisplatin was reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 80 mg/m2.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial was stopped early based on interim efficacy results triggered by the third safety analysis: median OS (mOS) favoured CF over CFP, regardless of cisplatin dose [hazard ratio (HR) 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-2.98; P = 0.028]. In the final analysis, mOS was 10.2 versus 9.4 months for CF versus CFP, respectively (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79-1.75; P = 0.43). One hundred (70.4%) of 142 patients in the safety population died, 51 (51.0%) with CFP. Most deaths were related to disease progression [44/49 (90%) deaths in CF versus 34/51 (67%) deaths in CFP]; objective responses [27/73 (37.0%)] were identical. The most common serious adverse events were kidney injury [3 (4.3%) versus 7 (9.7%)], general health deterioration [5 (7.1%) versus 5 (6.9%)] and dysphagia [4 (5.7%) versus 4 (5.6%)] in CF versus CFP, respectively. There were three (4.3%) and 17 (23.6%) common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade 5 events in CF versus CFP, respectively. Low soluble (s)EGFR levels were associated with better progression-free survival; sEGFR was induced under CFP.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      EGFR inhibition added to CF did not improve survival in unselected advanced ESCC patients. The results support further liquid biopsy studies.

The effect of dapagliflozin on renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Donald Elliott Kohan, Paola Fioretto, Kristina Johnsson, Shamik Parikh, Agata Ptaszynska, Lisa Ying, Donald Elliott Kohanet al.",2016 Jun,J Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26894924/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Dapagliflozin's antihyperglycemic effects are mediated by inhibition of renal sodium-glucose cotransporter-2; therefore, renal safety of dapagliflozin was assessed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twelve double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials were analyzed up to 24 weeks (N = 4545). Six of the 12 studies included long-term data for up to 102 weeks (N = 3036). Patients with type 2 diabetes with normal or mildly impaired renal function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)] were treated with dapagliflozin (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/day) or placebo. Renal adverse events (AEs) were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean eGFR showed small transient reductions with dapagliflozin at week 1, but returned to near baseline values by week 24 and remained stable to week 102. Mean eGFR changes were not very different for dapagliflozin 2.5, 5 and 10 mg versus placebo at 102 weeks: -0.74, 2.52 and 1.38 versus 1.31 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. Renal AEs were similar in frequency to placebo through 24 weeks (1.4, 1.3, 0.9, and 0.9 %, respectively) and 102 weeks (2.4, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.7 %, respectively). Few were serious (0.2, 0.1, 0 and 0.3 %, respectively, over 102 weeks). The most common renal event was serum creatinine increase. In sub-group analyses in patients ≥65 years of age or those with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), renal AEs occurred more frequently with dapagliflozin than placebo. No events of acute tubular necrosis were reported.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function, dapagliflozin is not associated with increased risk of acute renal toxicity or deterioration of renal function.

Combination of terlipressin and noradrenaline versus terlipressin in hepatorenal syndrome with early non-response to terlipressin infusion:  A randomized trial.,"Virendra Singh, Akshaya Jayachandran, Arka De, Akash Singh, Shivani Chandel, Navneet Sharma, Virendra Singhet al.",2023 Jun,Indian J Gastroenterol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37145232/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Terlipressin and noradrenaline are effective in the management of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). There are no reports on the combination of these vasoconstrictors in type-1 HRS.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To evaluate terlipressin with or without noradrenaline in type-1 HRS not responding to terlipressin at 48 hours.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixty patients were randomized to receive either terlipressin (group A; n = 30) or a combination of terlipressin and noradrenaline infusion (group B; n = 30). In group A, terlipressin infusion was started at 2 mg/day and increased by 1 mg/day (maximum 12 mg/day). In group B, terlipressin was given at a constant dose of 2 mg/day. Noradrenaline infusion was started at 0.5 mg/h at baseline and increased to 3 mg/h in a stepwise manner. The primary outcome was treatment response at 15 days. Secondary outcomes were 30-day survival, cost-benefit analysis and adverse events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was no significant difference in the response rate between the groups (50% vs. 76.7%, p = 0.06) and 30-day survival was similar (36.7% vs. 53.3%, p = 0.13). Treatment was more expensive in group A (USD 750 vs. 350, p < 0.001). Adverse events were more frequent in group A (36.7% vs. 13.3%, p < 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The combination of noradrenaline and terlipressin infusion results in a non-significantly higher rate of HRS resolution with significantly fewer adverse effects in HRS patients who do not respond to terlipressin within 48 hours.

Perioperative dexmedetomidine reduces the incidence and severity of acute kidney injury following valvular heart surgery.,"Jin Sun Cho, Jae-Kwang Shim, Sara Soh, Min Kyung Kim, Young-Lan Kwak, Jin Sun Choet al.",2016 Mar,Kidney Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26444030/,No keywords found,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiac surgery is closely interrelated with hemodynamic instability and sympathetic activity, and adversely influences prognosis. Here, we investigated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial whether dexmedetomidine, an α2 adrenoreceptor agonist, could prevent AKI after valvular heart surgery. Two hundred patients undergoing valvular heart surgery were randomly assigned to equal placebo or treatment groups. Dexmedetomidine was infused at a rate of 0.4 μg/kg/h starting immediately after anesthetic induction and continuing for 24 h after surgery. We then assessed the incidence of AKI during the first 48 postoperative hours, hemodynamic variables, and a composite of major morbidity end points. The incidence of AKI, based on Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria, was significantly lower in the treatment group compared with the control group (14 vs. 33%). The dexmedetomidine group exhibited a significantly lower incidence of a composite of major morbidity end points (21 vs. 38%) and a significantly shorter length of intensive care unit stay (3 [2, 3] days vs. 3 [2, 4] days) compared with the control group. Thus, perioperative infusion of dexmedetomidine effectively reduced both the incidence and severity of AKI, and improved outcome in patients undergoing valvular heart surgery without untoward hemodynamic side effects."
Randomized trial on acute toxicities of weekly vs three-weekly cisplatin-based chemoradiation in head and neck cancer.,"Ahmad Ameri, Shokoufe Norouzi, Ainaz Sourati, Samira Azghandi, Kambiz Novin, Farzad Taghizadeh-Hesary, Ahmad Ameriet al.",2022 Jan,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34101389/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The current first-line treatment of locally advanced head and neck carcinoma (LAHNC) is concurrent chemoradiation with three-weekly cisplatin 100 mg/m2 . However, prescribing cisplatin at this dose increases the treatment toxicity, which may compromise the treatment results. An alternative schedule is weekly 40 mg/m2 cisplatin.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To compare the acute hematologic and renal toxicities of these two regimens.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This randomized clinical trial included 77 LAHNC patients who were allocated to a high dose (100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) or low dose (40 mg/m2 weekly) cisplatin group concurrent with radiotherapy. Hematologic and renal indices were measured weekly during chemoradiation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The average age of patients was 55.3 years. Overall, 71.4% of patients were treated in a definitive setting. The incidence of severe hematologic events was not significantly different. However, the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly greater in the three-weekly group (67.85 vs. 58.57% mL/min per 1.73 m2 ; P-value = .02). Cumulative cisplatin dose of ≥240 mg/m2 was significantly greater in the weekly group. Totally, treatment breaks occurred in 40.3% of patients due to treatment toxicity. Treatment interruption was primarily due to neutropenia in the three-weekly and renal dysfunction and thrombocytopenia in the weekly group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Severe acute hematologic toxicities were comparable for three-weekly and weekly groups. The decrease in eGFR through treatment was more significant with weekly cisplatin. Further follow-up, however, is needed to confirm its impact on delayed renal function."
"Safer Prescribing--A Trial of Education, Informatics, and Financial Incentives.","Tobias Dreischulte, Peter Donnan, Aileen Grant, Adrian Hapca, Colin McCowan, Bruce Guthrie, Tobias Dreischulteet al.",2016 Mar 17,N Engl J Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26981935/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      High-risk prescribing and preventable drug-related complications are common in primary care. We evaluated whether the rates of high-risk prescribing by primary care clinicians and the related clinical outcomes would be reduced by a complex intervention.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge trial conducted in Tayside, Scotland, we randomly assigned participating primary care practices to various start dates for a 48-week intervention comprising professional education, informatics to facilitate review, and financial incentives for practices to review patients' charts to assess appropriateness. The primary outcome was patient-level exposure to any of nine measures of high-risk prescribing of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or selected antiplatelet agents (e.g., NSAID prescription in a patient with chronic kidney disease or coprescription of an NSAID and an oral anticoagulant without gastroprotection). Prespecified secondary outcomes included the incidence of related hospital admissions. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, with the use of mixed-effect models to account for clustering in the data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 34 practices underwent randomization, 33 of which completed the study. Data were analyzed for 33,334 patients at risk at one or more points in the preintervention period and for 33,060 at risk at one or more points in the intervention period. Targeted high-risk prescribing was significantly reduced, from a rate of 3.7% (1102 of 29,537 patients at risk) immediately before the intervention to 2.2% (674 of 30,187) at the end of the intervention (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.68; P<0.001). The rate of hospital admissions for gastrointestinal ulcer or bleeding was significantly reduced from the preintervention period to the intervention period (from 55.7 to 37.0 admissions per 10,000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.86; P=0.002), as was the rate of admissions for heart failure (from 707.7 to 513.5 admissions per 10,000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.95; P=0.02), but admissions for acute kidney injury were not (101.9 and 86.0 admissions per 10,000 person-years, respectively; rate ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.09; P=0.19).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A complex intervention combining professional education, informatics, and financial incentives reduced the rate of high-risk prescribing of antiplatelet medications and NSAIDs and may have improved clinical outcomes.

Hospitalized admitted patients with confirmed diagnosis of Influenza-A H1N1 infection were divided into two groups: group 1, which received antiviral (oseltamivir) drug alone and group 2, which received antiviral (oseltamivir) in combination with empirically prescribed antibiotic. Patients of both groups were assessed for incidences of AKI by two criteria i.e Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) and RIFLE. A total of 329 patients (176 for group 1 and 153 for group 2) were enrolled. According to RIFLE criteria, 23(13%) of group 1 and 9(6%) patients of groups 2 were suffered from AKI with statistically significant difference (P<0.05). Also as per AKIN criteria, the incidence of AKI is statistically significantly difference (P<0.05) between both groups with 18(10%) patients and 6(4%) patients of group 1 and 2 respectively. Length of hospitalization was statistically less (P<0.05) in group 2 patients.

      Protein loss and glucose absorption in children on acute peritoneal dialysis (PD) is important to inform dietary prescription, yet data are lacking in this regard. This study was a secondary analysis of a previously published crossover randomised controlled trial, aiming to describe glucose uptake and protein loss into dialysate among children with acute kidney injury (AKI) receiving PD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This secondary analysis described and compared dialysate albumin loss and glucose absorption in 15 children with AKI receiving PD or continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD). In addition, correlations between albumin loss, glucose absorption and other patient and dialysis factors were analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median (range) age and weight of participants were 6.0 (0.2-14) months and 5.8 (2.3-14.0) kg, respectively. Patients received approximately 8 h of dialysis on each modality; however, results were extrapolated and expressed per day. The mean ± SD albumin loss on conventional PD and CFPD was 0.3 ± 0.19 g/kg/day and 0.56 ± 0.5 g/kg/day, respectively, and the mean ± SD glucose absorption was 4.67 ± 2.87 g/kg/day and 3.85 ±4.1 g/kg/day, respectively. There was a moderate correlation between ultrafiltration and albumin loss during CFPD only (Pearson's R = 0.61; p = 0.02). There were no significant differences between PD and CFPD for either glucose absorption or albumin loss; however, the study was not powered for this outcome.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Protein losses and glucose absorption in children on PD with AKI are significant and should be considered when prescribing nutritional content. Protein losses on CFPD were twice as high as on conventional PD."
Scintigraphic evaluation of renal functional damage in volatile substance abusers.,"Derya Cayir, Koray Demirel, Meliha Korkmaz, Mine Araz, Gokhan Koca, Derya Cayiret al.",2016 Jun,Nucl Med Commun,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26881973/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      Volatile organic compounds can be maintained easily and can cause dependency. Volatile substance abuse may cause damage by affecting several systems. The aim of our study was to evaluate renal functional damage in volatile substance abusers by diuretic renogram.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty nine volatile substance abusers and 30 young healthy voluntary young men were included in our study. Technetium-99m mertiatide diuretic renogram was used to evaluate renal functions and collective system urodynamics to investigate the progress of renal functional damage. Images were evaluated visually and quantitatively. Split renal function of each kidney, time to peak activity (Tmax), and half-time for radiopharmaceutical clearance from pelvicalyceal system (T1/2), ratio of cortical and whole-kidney counts at 20-3 min, and maximum counts (T20/3 and T20/max) were compared in the two groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the study group, time to reach peak activity was statistically prolonged compared with the healthy volunteers. In the volatile substance abuser group, the average Tmax values, average T1/2 values, cortical and whole-kidney T20/3, and T20/max values were found to be prolonged compared with the control group in the diuretic renogram. There was no significant difference in the split renal function ratios between the two groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this study, possible renal functional damage was evaluated in volatile substance abusers by diuretic renogram. In conclusion, diuretic renogram can be useful in the evaluation of renal functional damage before blood renal function tests are affected and it could be used in the follow-up of the disease in volatile substance abusers. The results of this pilot study from our country, of course, should be supported by further clinical studies."
Magnesium supplementation therapy to prevent cisplatin-induced acute nephrotoxicity in pediatric cancer: a randomized phase-2 trial.,"Motohiro Matsui, Atsushi Makimoto, Motoaki Chin, Katsuyoshi Koh, Masako Tomotsune, Tetsuji Kaneko, Yoshihiko Morikawa, Riku Hamada, Yuki Yuza, Motohiro Matsuiet al.",2024 May,Int J Clin Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38564107/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The present study aimed to examine the effect of magnesium (Mg) supplementation on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) in pediatric cancer patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The present phase-2, open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial enrolled patients aged less than 20 years who were scheduled to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and randomly allocated them at a ratio of 1:1 to a Mg supplementation arm with even-numbered chemotherapy courses (arm AB) or another arm with odd-numbered courses (arm BA). Analysis objects were reconstructed into two groups depending on whether the chemotherapy course had Mg supplementation (group B) or not (group A). The primary outcome was the proportion of chemotherapy courses resulting in elevated serum creatinine per chemotherapy course. The secondary outcomes included efficacies evaluated using other biomarkers and the safety of the Mg supplementation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-eight patients were randomly allocated to either group (16 to arm AB and 12 to arm BA). The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. There was no significant difference in the proportion of courses with increased serum creatinine between the groups (group A: 10% vs. group B: 6%; P = 0.465) nor was any significant difference observed in other biomarkers during any chemotherapy course. The Mg value during chemotherapy was significantly higher in group B than that in group A. No adverse events related to magnesium administration were observed.
    


          Conclusions:

Effect of 3% saline and furosemide on biomarkers of kidney injury and renal tubular function and GFR in healthy subjects - a randomized controlled trial.,"F H Mose, A N Jörgensen, M H Vrist, N P Ekelöf, E B Pedersen, J N Bech, F H Moseet al.",2019 Jun 3,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159750/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Chloride is speculated to have nephrotoxic properties. In healthy subjects we tested the hypothesis that acute chloride loading with 3% saline would induce kidney injury, which could be prevented with the loop-diuretic furosemide.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Subjects were given 3% saline accompanied by either placebo or furosemide. Before, during and after infusion of 3% saline we measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), urinary chloride excretion (u-Cl), urinary excretions of aquaporin-2 (u-AQP2) and epithelial sodium channels (u-ENaCγ), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (u-NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (u-KIM-1) as marker of kidney injury and vasoactive hormones: renin (PRC), angiotensin II (p-AngII), aldosterone (p-Aldo) and arginine vasopressin (p-AVP). Four days prior to each of the two examinations subjects were given a standardized fluid and diet intake.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After 3% saline infusion u-NGAL and KIM-1 excretion increased slightly (u-NGAL: 17 ± 24 during placebo vs. -7 ± 23 ng/min during furosemide, p = 0.039, u-KIM-1: 0.21 ± 0.23 vs - 0.06 ± 0.14 ng/ml, p < 0.001). The increase in u-NGAL was absent when furosemide was given simultaneously, and the responses in u-NGAL were not significantly different from placebo control. Furosemide changed responses in u-KIM-1 where a delayed increase was observed. GFR was increased by 3% saline but decreased when furosemide accompanied the infusion. U-Na, FENa, u-Cl, and u-osmolality increased in response to saline, and the increase was markedly pronounced when furosemide was added. FEK decreased slightly during 3% saline infusion, but simultaneously furosemide increased FEK. U-AQP2 increased after 3% saline and placebo, and the response was further increased by furosemide. U-ENaCγ decreased to the same extent after 3% saline infusion in the two groups. 3% saline significantly reduced PRC, p-AngII and p-Aldo, and responses were attenuated by furosemide. p-AVP was increased by 3% saline, with a larger increase during furosemide.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study shows minor increases in markers of kidney injury after 3% saline infusion Furosemide abolished the increase in NGAL and postponed the increase in u-KIM-1. The clinical importance of these findings needs further investigation.

Intratumor cisplatin nephrotoxicity in combined laser-induced thermal therapy for cancer treatment.,"Marcel N Palumbo, Onivaldo Cervantes, Cecilia Eugênio, Flávia T P Hortense, João C Ribeiro, Ana Amélia P Paolini, Antônio C Tedesco, Joel A Sercarz, Marcos B Paiva, Marcel N Palumboet al.",2017 Oct,Lasers Surg Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28598516/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Thermal ablation of tumors by Nd:YAG laser has been growing as a multidisciplinary subspecialty defined as laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT), and has been increasingly accepted as a minimally invasive method for palliation of advanced or recurrent cancer. Previous studies have shown that adjuvant chemotherapy can potentiate laser thermal ablation of tumors leading to improved palliation in advanced cancer patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Evaluate nephrotoxicity by early markers of renal function in treating head and neck cancer using intra-tumor injections of cisplatin combined with laser-induced thermal therapy (CDDP-LITT).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Nine patients with recurrent head and neck tumors were treated by CDDP-LITT in order to determine nephrotoxicity related to this synergistic association. Among the tests requested to detect early were creatinine, magnesium, creatinine clearance, serum urea-BUN, type I urine, and proteinuria at 24 hours.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve recurrent tumors in nine patients were treated by CDDP-LITT. Pain was the major complaint (four patients), while other symptoms included dysphagia, dyspnea, bleeding, and difficulties in chewing. Fifteen laser procedures were performed and maximal CDDP dose was 50 mg. None of the markers for nephrotoxicity showed changes at these levels of CDDP intra-tumor injections.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This initial experience with (CDDP-LITT) indicates both safety and therapeutic potential for palliation of advanced head and neck cancer. However, safety and feasibility must be confirmed by longer follow-up and further escalation of CDDP doses in a Phase I study to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and demonstrate tangible benefits for patients.

The primary outcomes were increased expression of C7 in patients' skin and safety assessments (ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, autoimmune response); secondary outcomes included measuring wound healing in target wounds and assessment by a validated Epidermolysis Bullosa Disease Activity and Scarring Index (EBDASI) scoring system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An open-label pilot trial to assess two different IV gentamicin regimens between August 2018 and March 2020 with follow-up through to 180 days post-treatment was carried out. Three patients with RDEB with confirmed nonsense mutations in COL7A1 in either one or two alleles and decreased baseline expression of C7 at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) of their skin participated in the study. Three patients received gentamicin 7.5 mg kg-1 daily for 14 days and two of the three patients further received 7.5 mg kg-1 IV gentamicin twice weekly for 12 weeks. Patients who had pre-existing auditory or renal impairment, were currently using ototoxic or nephrotoxic medications, or had allergies to aminoglycosides or sulfate compounds were excluded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After gentamicin treatment, skin biopsies from all three patients (age range 18-28 years) exhibited increased C7 in their DEJ. With both regimens, the new C7 persisted for at least 6 months post-treatment. At 1 and 3 months post-treatment, 100% of the monitored wounds exhibited > 85% closure. Both IV gentamicin infusion regimens decreased EBDASI total activity scores. Of the patients assessed with the EBDASI, all exhibited decreased total activity scores 3 months post-treatment. All three patients completed the study; no adverse effects or anti-C7 antibodies were detected.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      IV gentamicin induced the readthrough of nonsense mutations in patients with RDEB and restored functional C7 in their skin, enhanced wound healing and improved clinical parameters. IV gentamicin may be a safe, efficacious, low-cost and readily available treatment for this population of patients with RDEB."
"Alpelisib in combination with everolimus ± exemestane in solid tumours: Phase Ib randomised, open-label, multicentre study.","Giuseppe Curigliano, Miguel Martin, Komal Jhaveri, J T Beck, Giampaolo Tortora, Nicola Fazio, Michela Maur, Richard A Hubner, Harald Lahner, Valerie Donnet, Olga Ajipa, Zheng Li, Lars Blumenstein, Fabrice Andre, Giuseppe Curiglianoet al.",2021 Jul:151:49-62.,Eur J Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33964572/,No keywords found,"Background and purpose:
        
      
      Combined mTORC1 inhibition with everolimus (EVE) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit p110α blockade with alpelisib (ALP) has demonstrated synergistic efficacy in preclinical models and supports testing the combination of ALP and EVE in the clinical setting. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of ALP in combination with EVE and in combination with EVE and exemestane (EXE) and subsequently assess safety, preliminary efficacy and effect of ALP on the pharmacokinetics of EVE and determine the magnitude of the drug-drug interaction.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Dose escalation phases were conducted in patients with advanced solid tumours and in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC). The dose expansion phase was conducted in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (both mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor [mTORi]-naive), in patients with mTORi-pretreated solid tumours and in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During the doublet escalation phase, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported in 5 of 10 (50%) patients: one patient had grade (Gr) 2 hyperglycemia and one patient had Gr 3 diarrhoea in the 300 mg dose group, one patient had Gr 2 hyperglycemia and one patient had Gr 4 hypocalcaemia in the 250 mg dose group, and one patient in the 200 mg dose group had Gr 3 diarrhoea and Gr 3 stomatitis. The combination of ALP 250 mg + EVE 2.5 mg was declared as the MTD/RDE in subjects with advanced solid tumours. In the triplet escalation phase, one patient who received ALP 200 mg + EVE 2.5 mg + EXE 25 mg had a DLT of Gr 3 acute kidney injury. This dose combination was declared as the MTD and RDE in subjects with advanced HR-positive HER2-negative BC. The common adverse events (≥30% patients), occurring across all phases, were hyperglycaemia, stomatitis, diarrhoea, nausea, asthenia, decreased appetite and fatigue. The sixteen-week progression-free survival rate was 52.4% (90% confidence interval [CI]: 32.8, 71.4) in the RCC cohort, 35.3% (90% CI: 16.6, 58.0) in the prior pNET cohort and 30.0% (90% CI: 8.7, 60.7) in the prior mTORi cohort. The pharmacokinetics of 2.5 mg of EVE was largely unchanged in the presence of ALP, independent of the dose (250 mg or 300 mg). There were no clinically relevant drug-drug interactions observed between ALP and EVE.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The overall safety profile of ALP with EVE and EXE is manageable and reversible; no unexpected safety signals were noted compared with the individual safety profiles. Pharmacokinetics of ALP, EVE and EXE was largely unchanged in combination with each other."
Adverse Events Associated with Encorafenib Plus Cetuximab in Patients with BRAFV600E-mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: An in-depth Analysis of the BEACON CRC Study.,"Julien Taieb, Sara Lonardi, Jayesh Desai, Gunnar Folprecht, Claire Gallois, Eduardo Polo Marques, Sadya Khan, Claire Castagné, Harpreet Wasan, Julien Taiebet al.",2023 Mar,Clin Colorectal Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36653241/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The BRAF inhibitor encorafenib in combination with cetuximab was recently approved for patients with BRAFV600E-mutated (BRAFV600Emut) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Approval was based on positive results from the phase 3 BEACON CRC study in BRAFV600Emut mCRC patients who had progressed after 1-2 previous regimens. This analysis provides a detailed examination of the adverse events (AEs) of interest (AEIs) with encorafenib+cetuximab in the BEACON study to aid gastrointestinal oncologists, given the limited experience with this combination.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      AEIs, including dermatological AEs, arthralgia/myalgia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue/asthenia and nephrotoxicity, were examined in the doublet therapy group. Clinical characteristics associated with these AEs, AE grade, time to onset and time to resolution were also studied.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Safety analysis included 216/220 patients randomized to doublet therapy. The most commonly occurring AEI was dermatological toxicity (75.5%), followed by arthralgia/myalgia (56.0%) and fatigue/asthenia (56.0%). Other than nephrotoxicity (7 patients; 5/7 with Grade 3 or 4), most AEs were Grade 1 or 2. Most AEs were more common in women than men (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dermatological AEs, and arthralgia/myalgia). Nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain and fatigue/asthenia were more common in patients aged ≥70 years. Most AEs developed early, within the first 1-2 months of treatment, and resolved within 1-2 weeks. In addition, survival outcomes were better in patients experiencing arthralgia/myalgia or dermatological toxicities.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This analysis indicated that, except for rare cases of nephrotoxicity, encorafenib+cetuximab is well tolerated in most patients, with most AEIs being mild-to-moderate in severity, occurring early and resolving rapidly.

Effect of a 3% gelatin solution on urinary KIM-1 levels in patients after thyroidectomy: a preliminary randomized controlled trial.,"Patrycja Leśnik, Ewa Woźnica-Niesobska#, Jarosław Janc#, Magdalena Mierzchała-Pasierb, Lidia Łysenko#, Patrycja Leśniket al.",2021 Dec 8,Sci Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34880372/,No keywords found,"Optimal fluid therapy significantly affects the maintenance of proper tissue perfusion and, consequently, kidney function. An adverse effect of colloids on kidney function is related to the incidence of postoperative kidney failure. The study aimed to assess the effect of a 3% gelatin solution on kidney function based on the urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (uKIM-1) level. This study used a parallel design and enrolled 64 adult patients with a mean age of 52.5 ± 13.1 years, all of whom underwent a thyroidectomy procedure under general anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to three comparison groups, each receiving a different dose of 3% gelatin solution during the thyroidectomy procedure. The patients from study groups A (n = 21) and B (n = 21) received a 3% gelatin solution at a dose of 30 ml/kg and 15 ml/kg body weight, respectively, during the first hour of the procedure. The patients from the control group C (n = 22) received an isotonic multi-electrolyte solution. Serum creatinine levels were determined, and urine samples were collected to determine levels of uKIM-1 before, 2 h, and 24 h after surgery. The patients' demographic data, type and volume of fluid and hemodynamic status during the surgery were collected from relevant anesthesia protocols and were included in the study data. There were no statistically significant changes between groups in hemodynamic parameters such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation values. A statistically significant increase in uKIM-1 level was noted in patients receiving the 3% gelatin solution regardless of the dose. A statistically significant difference in uKIM-1 level was observed between groups A, B, and C measured 24 h after surgery, with the highest uKIM-1 level in group A. Measurement of uKIM-1 level could be an early and sensitive biomarker of kidney injury. Kidney toxicity of a 3% gelatin solution, evaluated based on the level of uKIM-1 in urine, correlates with transfused fluid volume.

      To determine whether using topical vancomycin powder in fracture surgery may result in low levels of vancomycin in the serum and not result in nephrotoxicity.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Prospective observational at a single site as a substudy of the VANCO trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Single, large urban level I trauma center.
    


          Patients/participants:
        
      
      Fifty-eight patients with tibial plateau and pilon fractures randomized to the treatment arm at the principal investigator's site.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Topical vancomycin powder (1000 mg) applied directly in the wound over all metal implants at the time of wound closure.
    


          Main outcome measurements:
        
      
      Serum vancomycin levels at 1 hour and 6-8 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes included serum creatinine before surgery, a day after surgery, and at 2 weeks postoperatively and complete blood count at 2 weeks postoperatively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Except in 2 patients who also received intravenous vancomycin, none of the study patients had detectable (>5 µg/mL) serum vancomycin levels at 1 hour and 6-8 hours after surgery. One patient with a history of elevation of serum creatinine had a minor increase of serum creatinine but had undetectable vancomycin levels. None of the other patients had a clinically significant increase in creatinine levels.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite its relatively widespread usage, little data exist regarding the systemic levels and nephrotoxicity associated with the topical use of vancomycin powder in orthopaedic fracture surgery. These prospective data indicate that there seems to be little clinical concern regarding toxicity associated with systemic absorption of vancomycin powder in this specific clinical application.

"Pantoprazole, an Inhibitor of the Organic Cation Transporter 2, Does Not Ameliorate Cisplatin-Related Ototoxicity or Nephrotoxicity in Children and Adolescents with Newly Diagnosed Osteosarcoma Treated with Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin.","Elizabeth Fox, Kristin Levin, Yan Zhu, Blair Segers, Naomi Balamuth, Richard Womer, Rochelle Bagatell, Frank Balis, Elizabeth Foxet al.",2018 Jul,Oncologist,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29445029/,No keywords found,"Lessons learned:
        
      
      Using a randomized crossover design and continuous variables such as change in hearing threshold and biomarkers of acute renal injury as short-term endpoints, it was determined that pantoprazole, an organic cation transporter 2 inhibitor, did not ameliorate cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity.Cystatin C is a robust method to estimate glomerular filtration rate in patients with cancer. Using a patient-reported outcome survey, all patients identified tinnitus and subjective hearing loss occurring ""at least rarely"" after cycle 1, prior to objective high-frequency hearing loss measured by audiograms.New therapies that improve outcome with less acute and long-term toxicity are needed.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which is a cisplatin uptake transporter expressed on renal tubules and cochlear hair cells but not on osteosarcoma cells, mediates cisplatin uptake. Pantoprazole inhibits OCT2 and could ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Using a randomized crossover design, we evaluated audiograms, urinary acute kidney injury (AKI) biomarkers, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated from cystatin C (GFRcysC) in patients receiving cisplatin with and without pantoprazole.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Cisplatin (60 mg/m2 × 2 days per cycle) was administered concurrently with pantoprazole (intravenous [IV], 1.6 mg/kg over 4 hours) on cycles 1 and 2 or cycles 3 and 4 in 12 patients with osteosarcoma (OS) with a median (range) age of 12.8 (5.6-19) years. Audiograms, urinary AKI biomarkers, and serum cystatin C were monitored during each cycle.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Pantoprazole had no impact on decrements in hearing threshold at 4-8 kHz, post-treatment elevation of urinary AKI biomarkers, or GFRcysC (Fig. 1, Table 1). Histological response (percent necrosis) after two cycles was similar with or without pantoprazole. All eight patients with localized OS at diagnosis are alive and in remission; three of four patients with metastases at diagnosis have died.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Pantoprazole did not ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity. The decrease in GFRcysC and increase in N-acetyl-ß-glucosaminidase (NAG) and creatinine demonstrate that these biomarkers can quantify cisplatin glomerular and proximal tubular toxicity. OCT2 inhibition by pantoprazole did not appear to alter antitumor response or survival."

      Uncontrolled hypertension is a major problem among non-Hispanic black men, who are underrepresented in pharmacist intervention trials in traditional health care settings.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We enrolled a cohort of 319 black male patrons with systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more from 52 black-owned barbershops (nontraditional health care setting) in a cluster-randomized trial in which barbershops were assigned to a pharmacist-led intervention (in which barbers encouraged meetings in barbershops with specialty-trained pharmacists who prescribed drug therapy under a collaborative practice agreement with the participants’ doctors) or to an active control approach (in which barbers encouraged lifestyle modification and doctor appointments). The primary outcome was reduction in systolic blood pressure at 6 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At baseline, the mean systolic blood pressure was 152.8 mm Hg in the intervention group and 154.6 mm Hg in the control group. At 6 months, the mean systolic blood pressure fell by 27.0 mm Hg (to 125.8 mm Hg) in the intervention group and by 9.3 mm Hg (to 145.4 mm Hg) in the control group; the mean reduction was 21.6 mm Hg greater with the intervention (95% confidence interval, 14.7 to 28.4; P<0.001). A blood-pressure level of less than 130/80 mm Hg was achieved among 63.6% of the participants in the intervention group versus 11.7% of the participants in the control group (P<0.001). In the intervention group, the rate of cohort retention was 95%, and there were few adverse events (three cases of acute kidney injury).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among black male barbershop patrons with uncontrolled hypertension, health promotion by barbers resulted in larger blood-pressure reduction when coupled with medication management in barbershops by specialty-trained pharmacists.

      Besifovir dipivoxil maleate (BSV), an acyclic nucleotide phosphonate, shows potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus. Our previous 48-week trial revealed that BSV has comparable antiviral efficacy to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and better safety profiles in terms of improved renal and bone safety. This extension study evaluated the prolonged efficacy and safety of BSV in treatment-naive chronic hepatitis B patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients continued to participate in an open-label BSV study after an initial 48-week double-blind comparison of BSV and TDF treatment. The antiviral efficacy and drug safety was evaluated up to 192 weeks in two groups: patients continuing BSV treatment (BSV-BSV) and patients switching from TDF to BSV after 48 weeks (TDF-BSV).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 197 patients receiving randomized treatments, 170 (86%) entered the open-label phase and 152 (77%) entered the 192-week extension study. Virological response rates over 192 weeks were 92.50% and 93.06% in the BSV-BSV and TDF-BSV groups, respectively (P=0.90). Hepatitis B envelop antigen seroconversion and alanine aminotransferase normalization rates were similar between the groups (P=0.75 and P=0.36, respectively). There were no drug-resistant mutations to BSV. Bone mineral density and renal function were well preserved in the BSV-BSV group, whereas these initially worsened then recovered after switching therapy in the TDF-BSV group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      BSV maintained potent antiviral efficacy after 192 weeks and showed no evidence of drug resistance. BSV was safe, well tolerated, and effective in patients who switched from TDF to BSV. Trial Registration Number: NCT01937806 (date: 10 Sep 2013)."

      This study compared left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)-guided and urine flow rate (UFR)-guided hydration.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Tailored hydration regimens improve the prevention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Between July 15, 2015, and June 6, 2019, patients at high risk for CA-AKI scheduled for coronary and peripheral procedures were randomized to 2 groups: 1) normal saline infusion rate adjusted according to the LVEDP (LVEDP-guided group); and 2) hydration controlled by the RenalGuard System in order to reach UFR ≥300 ml/h (UFR-guided group). The primary endpoint was the composite of CA-AKI (i.e., serum creatinine increase ≥25% or ≥0.5 mg/dl at 48 h) and acute pulmonary edema (PE). Major adverse events (all-cause death, renal failure requiring dialysis, PE, and sustained kidney injury) at 1 month were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The primary endpoint occurred in 20 of 351 (5.7%) patients in the UFR-guided group and in 36 of 351 (10.3%) patients in the LVEDP-guided group (relative risk [RR]: 0.560; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.390 to 0.790; p = 0.036). CA-AKI and PE rates in the UFR-guided group and LVEDP-guided group were 5.7% and 10.0% (RR: 0.570; 95% CI: 0.300 to 0.960; p = 0.048), and, respectively, 0.3% and 2.0% (RR: 0.070; 95% CI: 0.020 to 1.160; p = 0.069). Three patients in the UFR-guided group experienced complications related to the Foley catheter. Hypokalemia rate was 6.2% in the UFR-guided group and 2.3% in the LVEDP-guided group (p = 0.013). The 1-month major adverse events rate was 7.1% in the UFR-guided group and 12.0% in the LVEDP-guided group (p = 0.030).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study demonstrates that UFR-guided hydration is superior to LVEDP-guided hydration to prevent the composite of CA-AKI and PE."

      We report a multicenter controlled trial comparing renal recovery and tolerance profile of doublet versus triplet bortezomib-based regimens in patients with initial myeloma cast nephropathy (CN) and acute kidney injury (AKI) without need for dialysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      After symptomatic measures and high-dose dexamethasone, patients were randomly assigned to receive bortezomib plus dexamethasone (BD), or BD plus cyclophosphamide (C-BD). In patients with < 50% reduction of serum free light chains (sFLCs) after 3 cycles, chemotherapy was reinforced with either cyclophosphamide (BD group) or thalidomide (C-BD group).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ninety-two patients were enrolled in each group. At random assignment, characteristics of the 2 groups were similar, including median age (68 years) and serum creatinine level (305.5 and 273.5 µmol/L in BD and C-BD group, respectively). At 3 months, renal response rate (primary end point) was not different (41 v 47 responders in the BD and C-BD groups, respectively; relative risk [RR], 0.87; P = .46). Very good partial response (free light chain reduction ≥ 90%) or more was achieved in 36 and 47 patients, respectively (RR, 0.76; P = .10). After 1 cycle of chemotherapy, 69 in the BD group and 67 patients in the C-BD group had achieved sFLC level ≤ 500 mg/L. Serious adverse events were recorded in 30 and 40 patients, respectively. At 12 months, 19 patients had died (9 in the BD group v 10 in the C-BD group), including 10 (6 in the BD group and 4 in the C-BD group) from myeloma progression and 3 (0 in the BD group and 3 in the C-BD group) from infection. Within median follow-up of 27 months, 43 and 42 patients switched to new therapy, respectively. Overall, 50 patients (24 in the BD group and 26 in the C-BD group) had died.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This randomized study did not show any benefit of C-BD compared with BD on renal recovery of patients with initial CN not requiring dialysis. Adding cyclophosphamide did not sufficiently improve the efficacy-toxicity balance. Patients with myeloma with AKI are fragile, and indication for doublet or triplet regimen should be adapted to frailty."
"Urine biomarkers of acute kidney injury in noncritically ill, hospitalized children treated with chemotherapy.","Maya Sterling, Zubaida Al-Ismaili, Kelly R McMahon, Melissa Piccioni, Michael Pizzi, Theresa Mottes, Larry C Lands, Sharon Abish, Adam J Fleming, Michael R Bennett, Ana Palijan, Prasad Devarajan, Stuart L Goldstein, Maureen M O'Brien, Michael Zappitelli, Maya Sterlinget al.",2017 Oct,Pediatr Blood Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28417544/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cisplatin (Cis), carboplatin (Carb), and ifosfamide (Ifos) are common nephrotoxic chemotherapies. Biomarkers of tubular injury may allow for early acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnosis.
    


          Procedure:
        
      
      We performed a two-center (Canada, United States) pilot study to prospectively measure serum creatinine (SCr), urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) in children receiving Cis/Carb (27 episodes), Ifos (30 episodes), and in 15 hospitalized, nonchemotherapy patients. We defined AKI using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition. We compared postchemotherapy infusion NGAL and IL-18 concentrations (immediate postdose to 3 days later) to pre-infusion concentrations. We calculated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for postinfusion biomarkers to discriminate for AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Prechemotherapy infusion NGAL and IL-18 concentrations were not higher than nonchemotherapy control concentrations. Increasing chemotherapy dose was associated with increasing postinfusion (0-4 hr after infusion) NGAL (P < 0.05). Post-Ifos, immediate postdose, and daily postdose NGAL and IL-18 were significantly higher than pre-infusion biomarker concentrations (P < 0.05), during AKI episodes. NGAL and IL-18 did not rise significantly after Cis-Carb infusion, relative to predose concentrations (P > 0.05). NGAL and IL-18 measured immediately after Ifos infusion discriminated for AKI with AUCs is 0.80 (standard error = 0.13) and 0.73 (standard error = 0.16), respectively. NGAL and IL-18 were not diagnostic of Cis-Carb-associated AKI. When AUCs were adjusted for age, all biomarker AUCs (Cis-Carb and Ifos) improved.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Urine NGAL and IL-18 show promise as early AKI diagnostic tests in children treated with ifosfamide and may have a potential role in drug toxicity monitoring."
Concerning Safety and Efficacy of Concurrent and Consolidative Durvalumab With Thoracic Radiation Therapy in PDL1-Unselected Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Brief Report.,"Yuanyuan Zhang, Puneeth Iyengar, Steven Montalvo, Kenneth D Westover, Sawsan Rashdan, Kavitha Donthireddy, James Kim, Jonathan E Dowell, Benjamin Drapkin, Sheena Bhalla, Christian Chukwuma, Urooba Nadeem, Chul Ahn, Robert D Timmerman, David E Gerber, Yuanyuan Zhanget al.",2025 Jan 1,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39147210/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Consolidative durvalumab, an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, administered after concurrent chemoradiation improves outcomes of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without substantially increasing toxicities. We studied a chemotherapy-free regimen of thoracic radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent and consolidative durvalumab.
    


          Methods and materials:
        
      
      This single-arm phase 2 trial enrolled patients with stage III NSCLC (regardless of tumor PDL1 expression), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1, adequate pulmonary function, and RT fields meeting standard organ constraints. Participants received 2 cycles of durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks) concurrently with thoracic RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions), followed by up to 13 cycles of consolidative durvalumab.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After 10 patients were enrolled, the trial was closed because of poor clinical outcomes. With a median follow-up of 12 months, 5 patients had disease progression and 8 patients died. Six patients experienced 15 treatment-related, grade ≥3 events, including 1 grade 4 acute kidney injury during consolidation and 2 fatal pulmonary events. One fatal pulmonary event occurred during the concurrent phase in an active smoker; the other occurred after the first cycle of consolidative durvalumab. The primary endpoint of progression-free survival at 12 months was 20% (50% for PDL1≥1% vs 0% for PDL1 unavailable or <1%). Median overall survival was not reached, 10.5 months, and 7 months, for PDL1 ≥1%, <1%, and unavailable, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In PDL1 unselected stage III NSCLC, thoracic RT plus concurrent and consolidative durvalumab is associated with high-grade toxicity and early disease progression."
Continuing versus withholding angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)/calcium channel blocker (CCB) combination tablets during perioperative periods in patients undergoing minor surgery: a single-blinded randomized controlled trial.,"Kazuyo Takeuchi, Masakazu Hayashida, Osamu Kudoh, Naoko Niimi, Kumi Kataoka, Maho Kakemizu-Watanabe, Makiko Yamamoto, Atsuko Hara, Izumi Kawagoe, Keisuke Yamaguchi, Kazuyo Takeuchiet al.",2022 Jun,J Anesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35247102/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      This trial was conducted to compare effects of continuing versus withholding single-pill combination tablets consisting of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on perioperative hemodynamics and clinical outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients undergoing minor abdominal or urological surgery (n = 106) were randomly assigned to Group C, in which ARB/CCB combination tablets were continued until surgery, or Group W, in which they were withheld within 24 h of surgery. Perioperative hemodynamics and clinical outcomes were compared between the Groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of hypotension during anesthesia requiring repeated treatment with vasoconstrictors was higher in Group C than Group W (p = 0.0052). Blood pressure during anesthesia was generally lower in Group C than Group W (p < 0.05) despite significantly more doses of ephedrine and phenylephrine administrated in Group C (p = 0.0246 and p = 0.0327, respectively). The incidence of postoperative hypertension did not differ between Groups (p = 0.3793). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on the preoperative day did not differ between Groups (p = 0.7045), while eGFR was slightly lower in Group C than Group W on the first and third postoperative days (p = 0.0400 and p = 0.0088, respectively), although clinically relevant acute kidney injury did not develop.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Continuing ARB/CCB combination tablets preoperatively in patients undergoing minor surgery increased the incidence of hypotension during anesthesia, increased requirements of vasoconstrictors to treat hypotension, and might deteriorate postoperative renal function, albeit slightly. These results suggest that withholding ARB/CCB tablets preoperatively is preferable to continuing them.

Toxicity of Amphotericin B Deoxycholate-Based Induction Therapy in Patients with HIV-Associated Cryptococcal Meningitis.,"Tihana Bicanic, Christian Bottomley, Angela Loyse, Annemarie E Brouwer, Conrad Muzoora, Kabanda Taseera, Arthur Jackson, Jacob Phulusa, Mina C Hosseinipour, Charles van der Horst, Direk Limmathurotsakul, Nicholas J White, Douglas Wilson, Robin Wood, Graeme Meintjes, Thomas S Harrison, Joseph N Jarvis, Tihana Bicanicet al.",2015 Dec,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26349818/,No keywords found,"Amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBd) is the recommended induction treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Its use is hampered by toxicities that include electrolyte abnormalities, nephrotoxicity, and anemia. Protocols to minimize toxicity are applied inconsistently. In a clinical trial cohort of AmBd-based CM induction treatment, a standardized protocol of preemptive hydration and electrolyte supplementation was applied. Changes in blood counts, electrolyte levels, and creatinine levels over 14 days were analyzed in relation to the AmBd dose, treatment duration (short course of 5 to 7 days or standard course of 14 days), addition of flucytosine (5FC), and outcome. In the 368 patients studied, the hemoglobin levels dropped by a mean of 1.5 g/dl (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 1.9 g/dl) following 7 days of AmBd and by a mean of 2.3 g/dl (95% CI, 1.1 to 3.6 g/dl) after 14 days. Serum creatinine levels increased by 37 μmol/liter (95% CI, 30 to 45 μmol/liter) by day 7 and by 49 μmol/liter (95% CI, 35 to 64μmol/liter) by day 14 of AmBd treatment. Overall, 33% of patients developed grade III/IV anemia, 5.6% developed grade III hypokalemia, 9.5% had creatinine levels that exceeded 220 μmol, and 6% discontinued AmBd prematurely. The addition of 5FC was associated with a slight increase in anemia but not neutropenia. Laboratory abnormalities stabilized or reversed during the second week in patients on short-course induction. Grade III/IV anemia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.3; P = 0.028) and nephrotoxicity (aOR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.8 to 11; P = 0.001) were risk factors for 10-week mortality. In summary, routine intravenous saline hydration and preemptive electrolyte replacement during AmBd-based induction regimens for HIV-associated CM minimized the incidence of hypokalemia and nephrotoxicity. Anemia remained a concerning adverse effect. The addition of flucytosine was not associated with increased neutropenia. Shorter AmBd courses were less toxic, with rapid reversibility."
Albumin infusion improves renal blood flow autoregulation in patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis and acute kidney injury.,"Rita Garcia-Martinez, Lorette Noiret, Sambit Sen, Rajeshwar Mookerjee, Rajiv Jalan, Rita Garcia-Martinezet al.",2015 Feb,Liver Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24620819/,No keywords found,"Background & aims:
        
      
      In cirrhotic patients with renal failure, renal blood flow autoregulation curve is shifted to the right, which is consequent upon sympathetic nervous system activation and endothelial dysfunction. Albumin infusion improves renal function in cirrhosis by mechanisms that are incompletely understood. We aimed to determine the effect of albumin infusion on systemic haemodynamics, renal blood flow, renal function and endothelial function in patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis and acute kidney injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twelve patients with refractory ascites and 10 patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis and acute kidney injury were studied. Both groups were treated with intravenous albumin infusion, 40-60 g/days over 3-4 days. Cardiac and renal haemodynamics were measured. Endothelial activation/dysfunction was assessed using von Willebrand factor and serum nitrite levels. F2α Isoprostanes, resting neutrophil burst and noradrenaline levels were quantified as markers of oxidative stress, endotoxemia and sympathetic activation respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Albumin infusion leads to a shift in the renal blood flow autoregulation curve towards normalization, which resulted in a significant increase in renal blood flow. Accordingly, improvement of renal function was observed. In parallel, a significant decrease in sympathetic activation, inflammation/oxidative stress and endothelial activation/dysfunction was documented. Improvement of renal blood flow correlated with improvement in endothelial activation (r = 0.741, P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The data suggest that albumin infusion improves renal function in acutely decompensated cirrhotic patients with acute kidney injury by impacting on renal blood flow autoregulation. This is possibly achieved through endothelial stabilization and a reduction in the sympathetic tone, endotoxemia and oxidative stress."
Effect of No Prehydration vs Sodium Bicarbonate Prehydration Prior to Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography in the Prevention of Postcontrast Acute Kidney Injury in Adults With Chronic Kidney Disease: The Kompas Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Rohit J Timal, Judith Kooiman, Yvo W J Sijpkens, Jean-Paul P M de Vries, Iris J A M Verberk-Jonkers, Harald F H Brulez, Marjolijn van Buren, Aart J van der Molen, Suzanne C Cannegieter, Hein Putter, Wilbert B van den Hout, J Wouter Jukema, Ton J Rabelink, Menno V Huisman, Rohit J Timalet al.",2020 Apr 1,JAMA Intern Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32065601/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Prevention of postcontrast acute kidney injury in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) by means of prehydration has been standard care for years. However, evidence for the need for prehydration in this group is limited.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess the renal safety of omitting prophylactic prehydration prior to iodine-based contrast media administration in patients with stage 3 CKD.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      The Kompas trial was a multicenter, noninferiority, randomized clinical trial conducted at 6 hospitals in the Netherlands in which 523 patients with stage 3 CKD were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive no prehydration or prehydration with 250 mL of 1.4% sodium bicarbonate administered in a 1-hour infusion before undergoing elective contrast-enhanced computed tomography from April 2013 through September 2016. Final follow-up was completed in September 2017. Data were analyzed from January 2018 to June 2019.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      In total, 262 patients were allocated to the no prehydration group and 261 were allocated to receive prehydration. Analysis on the primary end point was available in 505 patients (96.6%).
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary end point was the mean relative increase in serum creatinine level 2 to 5 days after contrast administration compared with baseline (noninferiority margin of less than 10% increase in serum creatinine level). Secondary outcomes included the incidence of postcontrast acute kidney injury 2 to 5 days after contrast administration, mean relative increase in creatinine level 7 to 14 days after contrast administration, incidences of acute heart failure and renal failure requiring dialysis, and health care costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 554 patients randomized, 523 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The median (interquartile range) age was 74 (67-79) years; 336 (64.2%) were men and 187 (35.8%) were women. The mean (SD) relative increase in creatinine level 2 to 5 days after contrast administration compared with baseline was 3.0% (10.5) in the no prehydration group vs 3.5% (10.3) in the prehydration group (mean difference, 0.5; 95% CI, -1.3 to 2.3; P < .001 for noninferiority). Postcontrast acute kidney injury occurred in 11 patients (2.1%), including 7 of 262 (2.7%) in the no prehydration group and 4 of 261 (1.5%) in the prehydration group, which resulted in a relative risk of 1.7 (95% CI, 0.5-5.9; P = .36). None of the patients required dialysis or developed acute heart failure. Subgroup analyses showed no evidence of statistical interactions between treatment arms and predefined subgroups. Mean hydration costs were €119 (US $143.94) per patient in the prehydration group compared with €0 (US $0) in the no prehydration group (P < .001). Other health care costs were similar.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients with stage 3 CKD undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography, withholding prehydration did not compromise patient safety. The findings of this study support the option of not giving prehydration as a safe and cost-efficient measure.

Risk factors for high-dose methotrexate associated acute kidney injury in patients with hematological malignancies.,"Irina Amitai, Uri Rozovski, Reem El-Saleh, Shai Shimony, Daniel Shepshelovich, Benaya Rozen-Zvi, Pia Raanani, Anat Gafter-Gvili, Ronit Gurion, Irina Amitaiet al.",2020 Oct,Hematol Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32506594/,"acute kidney injury, albumin, lactic dehydrogenase, methotrexate, survival.","High dose methotrexate (HDMTX)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-known adverse event in hemato-oncology patients. Our purpose was to define factors and setup cut-offs that may help better identify patients at-risk for developing AKI following HDMTX. All consecutive patients who received MTX dose ≥1 g were retrospectively reviewed. We compared patients with or without renal toxicity. We used a logistic regression model to define baseline variables associated with AKI. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method employing log-rank test. Between 2012 and 2017, 160 patients were included with a total of 265 courses. Indications included: primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, CNS prophylaxis in other lymphoma types, acute lymphatic leukemia and others. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range, 18-84), 54% were males, median MTX dose was 1941 mg/m2 (range, 743-5442) and AKI developed in 9% of drug administrations (n = 24). In univariate analysis: age > 40, LDH > 380 units/L, eGFR < 112 mL/min, albumin <3.6 mg/dL at baseline and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) were associated with AKI. In multivariable analysis, only LDH > 380 units/L (OR = 4.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-20.9, P = .04) and albumin levels <3.6 g/dL (OR = 4.17, 95% CI 1.04-6.5, P = .04) remained significant. In patients with AKI, median drug elimination was longer (8 days vs 5 days). In 80% of cases, the creatinine levels returned to normal within 1 month. Yet, the median survival of patients who developed AKI was 37 months, compared to 145 months in patients without AKI (Log rank = 0.015). In conclusion, LDH > 380 units/L and albumin <3.6 g/dL were the strongest factors associated with AKI in patients receiving HDMTX. Although the rise in creatinine levels was almost uniformly reversible, AKI was associated with increased mortality rates."
Lenalidomide and dexamethasone for acute light chain-induced renal failure: a phase II study.,"Heinz Ludwig, Elisabeth Rauch, Thomas Kuehr, Zdeněk Adam, Adalbert Weißmann, Hedwig Kasparu, Eva-Maria Autzinger, Daniel Heintel, Richard Greil, Wolfram Poenisch, Ercan Müldür, Niklas Zojer, Heinz Ludwiget al.",2015 Mar,Haematologica,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25398836/,No keywords found,"We prospectively evaluated the activity and tolerance of lenalidomide-dexamethasone in 35 patients with acute light chain-induced renal failure. The lenalidomide dose was adapted to the estimated glomerular filtration rate and dexamethasone was given at high dose in cycle one and at low dose thereafter. Four patients died within the first two cycles, and five discontinued therapy leaving 26 patients for the per-protocol analysis. Responses were observed in 24/35 (68.6%) patients of the intent-to-treat population. Complete response was noted in seven patients (20%), very good partial response in three patients (8.6%), partial response in 14 patients (40%), and minimal response in one patient (2.9%). Renal response was observed in 16 (45.7%) patients: five (14.2%) achieved complete, four (11.4%) partial and seven (20%) minor renal responses. Five of 13 patients who were dialysis dependent at baseline became dialysis independent. The median time to myeloma and to renal response was 28 days for both parameters, while the median time to best myeloma and best renal response was 92 and 157 days, respectively. The median estimated glomerular filtration rate increased significantly in patients with partial response or better from 17.1 mL/min at baseline to 39.1 mL/min at best response (P=0.001). The median progression-free and overall survival was 5.5 and 21.8 months, respectively, in the intent-to-treat population and 12.1 and 31.4 months, respectively, in the per-protocol group. Infections, cardiotoxicity, anemia and thrombocytopenia were the most frequent toxicities.

Impact of terlipressin infusion during and after live donor liver transplantation on incidence of acute kidney injury and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin serum levels: A randomized controlled trial.,"Mohamed A Kandil, Khalid M Abouelenain, Ayman Alsebaey, Hanaa S Rashed, Mohamed H Afifi, Mohamed A Mahmoud, Khaled A Yassen, Mohamed A Kandilet al.",2017 Aug,Clin Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28564127/,No keywords found,"Background and aim:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) with liver transplantation (LT) is not uncommon. Impact of terlipressin infusion on AKI, hemodynamics, and plasma concentration of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was studied.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients (n=50) were randomized (NCT02059460, USA) into two equal groups: terlipressin vs Controls. Terlipressin (1-4 μg/kg/h) was administrated for 5 days. Intraoperative transesophageal Doppler for hemodynamic management. Renal functions, peak portal vein blood flow velocity (PPV), and hepatic artery resistive index (HARI) were recorded. Plasma NGAL (pNGAL) was measured baseline, 2 and 24 hours postreperfusion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was the main etiology. Age, sex, model of end-stage liver disease (MELD), and renal functions were comparable. Postoperative AKI incidence and NGAL concentrations were comparable (P>.05) between terlipressin and controls groups (44% vs 48% and 112.5±9 vs 93.1±8 ng/mL), respectively, but intraoperative NGAL in both groups increased significantly 2 hours postreperfusion (P<.05). The three NGAL readings were comparable (P>.05) between AKI (n=23) and non-AKI developers (n=27). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained in both groups with less systemic vascular resistance (SVR) fluctuations with terlipressin. Median norepinephrine consumption was lower in terlipressin vs controls (8 vs 12 mg; P=.04). The PPV and HARI were not affected by terlipressin at any stage (P>.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Postliver transplant AKI was not prevented by terlipressin use nor predicted by NGAL levels."

      Soluble inflammatory mediators are known to exacerbate sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been suggested to play a part in immunomodulation by cytokine removal. However, the effect of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) dose on inflammatory cytokine removal and its influence on patient outcomes are not yet clear.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label trial.
    


          Setting & participants:
        
      
      Septic patients with AKI receiving CVVHDF for AKI.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Conventional (40mL/kg/h) and high (80mL/kg/h) doses of CVVHDF for the duration of CRRT.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      Patient and kidney survival at 28 and 90 days, circulating cytokine levels.
    


          Results:
        
      
      212 patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. Mean age was 62.1 years, and 138 (65.1%) were men. Mean intervention durations were 5.4 and 6.2 days for the conventional- and high-dose groups, respectively. There were no differences in 28-day mortality (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.73-1.43; P=0.9) or 28-day kidney survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.48-1.93; P=0.9) between groups. High-dose CVVHDF, but not the conventional dose, significantly reduced interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-1b, and IL-10 levels. There were no differences in the development of electrolyte disturbances between the conventional- and high-dose groups.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Small sample size. Only the predilution CVVHDF method was used and initiation criteria were not controlled.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      High CVVHDF dose did not improve patient outcomes despite its significant influence on inflammatory cytokine removal. CRRT-induced immunomodulation may not be sufficient to influence clinical end points."

All-cause AEs were selected based on ≥2 % incidence from previously reported KEYNOTE-189 data and included neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, asthenia, fatigue, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pneumonitis, and renal events. Descriptive statistics summarized all-cause AEs. Medians and interquartile ranges were used to examine time-to-onset and time-to-resolution. The data cutoff was November 8, 2017.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In both treatment arms, most non-hematologic (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and asthenia), and hematologic (febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia) grade ≥3 AEs with ≥2 % incidence had a median time-to-onset within the first 4 cycles, and a median time-to-resolution of within 2 weeks from onset. A small number of AEs had longer median time-to-onset (pneumonitis and fatigue) and median time-to-resolution (pneumonitis, fatigue, acute kidney injury, and anemia). Among patients who received ≥5 cycles of pemetrexed, the incidence of any-grade renal toxicity in the pemetrexed/pembrolizumab/platinum arm was 2.3 % in Cycles 1-4, 4.8 % in Cycles 5-8, 2.6 % in Cycles 9-12, and 2.5 % in Cycles ≥13; and, in the pemetrexed/placebo/platinum arm, 0.7 % in Cycles 1-4, 1.5 % in Cycles 5-8, 1.3 % in Cycles 9-12, and 2.0 % in Cycles ≥13.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Pemetrexed/pembrolizumab/platinum has manageable toxicity with longer duration of treatment. While the incidence of renal toxicity was slightly higher in the pembrolizumab combination as compared to pemetrexed, the incidence did not increase in later treatment cycles. These results support the safe use of the KEYNOTE-189 regimen in clinical practice.

"Combined BRAF, MEK, and heat-shock protein 90 inhibition in advanced BRAF V600-mutant melanoma.","Zeynep Eroglu, Y Ann Chen, Inna Smalley, Jiannong Li, Joseph K Markowitz, Andrew S Brohl, Leticia Tetteh, Hayley Taylor, Vernon K Sondak, Nikhil I Khushalani, Keiran S M Smalley, Zeynep Erogluet al.",2024 Jan,Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37776537/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF V600-mutant melanoma is common. Multiple resistance mechanisms involve heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) clients, and a phase 1 study of vemurafenib with the HSP90 inhibitor XL888 in patients with advanced melanoma showed activity equivalent to that of BRAF and MEK inhibitors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) and cobimetinib (60 mg orally once daily for 21 of 28 days) with escalating dose cohorts of XL888 (30, 45, 60, or 90 mg orally twice weekly) was investigated in a phase 1 trial of advanced melanoma, with a modified Ji dose-escalation design.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-five patients were enrolled. After two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) (rash and acute kidney injury) in the first cohort, lower doses of vemurafenib (720 mg) and cobimetinib (40 mg) were investigated with the same XL888 doses. Three DLTs (rash) were observed in 12 patients in the XL888 60-mg cohort, and this was determined as the maximum tolerated dose. Objective responses were observed in 19 patients (76%), and the median progression-free survival was 7.6 months, with a 5-year progression-free survival rate of 20%. The median overall survival was 41.7 months, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 37%. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on baseline and on-treatment biopsies; treatment was associated with increased immune cell influx (CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells) and decreased melanoma cells.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Combined vemurafenib and cobimetinib plus XL888 had significant toxicity, requiring frequent dose reductions, which may have contributed to the relatively low progression-free survival despite a high tumor response rate. Given overlapping toxicities, caution must be used when combining HSP90 inhibitors with BRAF and MEK inhibitors."
A phase Ib dose escalation study of oral monotherapy with KX2-391 in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia.,"Margaret T Kasner, Molly B Halloran, Jonathan Pan, Ellen K Ritchie, Gerald J Fetterly, Douglas Kramer, David G Hangauer, James E Thompson, Margaret T Kasneret al.",2022 Aug,Invest New Drugs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35579731/,"Acute Myeloid Leukemia, KX01, KX2-391, Phase I, Src Kinase, Tirbanibulin.","Poor tolerance to standard therapies and multi-drug resistance complicate treatment of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is therefore imperative to explore novel tolerable agents and target alternative pathways. KX2-391 is an oral non-ATP-competitive inhibitor of Src kinase and tubulin polymerization. This multi-center phase Ib open-label safety and activity study involved elderly patients with relapsed or refractory AML, or who declined standard chemotherapy. Twenty-four patients averaging 74 years of age were enrolled. The majority previously received hypomethylating agents. Five doses were tested: 40 mg (n = 1), 80 mg (n = 2), 120 mg (n = 8), 140 mg (n = 12), and 160 mg (n = 1). Seven patients were treated for 12 days or less, nine for 15-29 days, five for 33-58 days, and three for 77-165 days. One patient receiving 120 mg for 165 days had reduced splenomegaly and survived 373 days. Another had no evidence of disease progression for 154 days. One patient receiving 160 mg for 12 days remained treatment-free for about 18 months. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in eight patients at: 120 mg (transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia), 140 mg (mucositis, allergic reaction, transaminitis, acute kidney injury), and 160 mg (mucositis). The maximum tolerated dose for KX2-391 was 120 mg once daily. KX2-391 bone marrow concentrations were approximately similar to plasma concentrations. This is the first study to evaluate the safety of KX2-391 in elderly patients with AML. Further studies are warranted, including alternative dosing phase I trials evaluating shorter courses at higher doses and phase II trials.

Fluid resuscitation and standard drug treatment strategies in heatstroke Chinese patients.,"K Hongjun, S Qing, Z Yan, P Liang, L Hui, Z Feihu, K Hongjunet al.",2015 Jan,Drug Res (Stuttg),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24668574/,No keywords found,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate different stage fluid and standard drug treatment strategies in 47 heatstroke patients. 47 adults with Heatstroke received fluid resuscitation treatment guided by transpulmonary thermodilution (PiCCO) in our intensive care unit. Systemic hemodynamics, microvascular indices and measures of acidosis, renal function, and pulmonary edema were followed prospectively. The speed of recovery and the component change was compared during the 6 h, 48 h and 96 h after the 3 stage fluid therapy. All patients were hyperpyrexia (core temperature>41°C), and on ventilation when enrolled in the ICU. Patients received a 6.17 (±1.8) ml/kg/h of crystal fluid and 3.31 (±0.5) ml/kg/h of colloidal fluid in the first 6 h; (3.41±1.2) ml/kg/h crystal fluid along with 2.27 (±0.3) ml/kg/h colloidal fluid in the first 48 h; 2.27 (±0.6) ml/kg/h crystal fluid along with 2.06 (±0.3) ml/kg/h colloidal fluid in the next 48 h. With resuscitation, acid-base status deteriorated in 25 of 47 patients (53.1%), extravascular lung water increased in 36 of 47 resuscitated patients (77%); 21 of these patients developed pulmonary edema though guided by transpulmonary thermodilution, 30 (63.8%) patients survived. All patients with pulmonary edema during the study were hypovolemic or euvolemic at the time pulmonary edema developed. Plasma lactate was lower in hypovolemic patients before (p<0.05) and after (p<0.05) resuscitation. Acute kidney injury was evident in 21 of 47 patients (47%) 48 h after enrollment. In conclusion, our study revealed that fluid resuscitation post heatstroke should be adjusted according to different stages."
Effect of dexmedetomidine on perioperative hemodynamics and organ protection in children with congenital heart disease: A randomized controlled trial.,"Shaopeng Ming, Yongguo Xie, Xueke Du, Haiqing Huang, Yue Fan, Qingxuan Liang, Yubo Xie, Shaopeng Minget al.",2021 Jan 8,Medicine (Baltimore),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33429762/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on hemodynamics and organ protection in congenital heart disease (CHD) children who underwent open-heart surgery under cryogenic cardiopulmonary bypass.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ninety children were randomly allocated to group C (0.9% saline 0.2 μg/kg/hour), group D1 (Dex 0.2 μg/kg/hour), and group D2 (Dex 0.4 μg/kg/hour) (n = 30 per group). All participants received fentanyl, propofol and 1% sevoflurane for anesthesia induction. Hemodynamic data were measured from T0 (before the induction) to T7 (30 minutes after extubation). The difference of arterial internal jugular vein bulbar oxygen difference and cerebral oxygen extraction ratio were calculated according to Fick formula. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect the serum myocardial, brain and kidney injury markers. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was calculated by serum creatinine level. Tracheal extubation time, postoperative pain score and emergence agitation score were also recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared with group C, group D1, and D2 exhibited reduction in hemodynamic parameters, myocardial and brain injury indicators, and tracheal extubation time. There were no significant differences in blood urea nitrogen and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin or incidence of AKI among the 3 groups. Besides, the incidence of tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and moderate agitation, and the FLACC scale in group D1 and D2 were lower than those in group C. Moreover, Dex 0.4 g/kg/hour could further reduce the dosage of fentanyl and dopamine compared with Dex 0.2 g/kg/hour.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dex anesthesia can effectively maintain hemodynamic stability and diminish organ injuries in CHD children."
"Aminoglycosides in Critically Ill Septic Patients With Acute Kidney Injury Receiving Intermittent Hemodialysis: A Multicenter, Observational Study.","Alexandre Boyer, Jean-François Timsit, Kada Klouche, Emmanuel Canet, Thuy-Nga Phan, Julien Bohé, Sebastien Rubin, Arthur Orieux, Alexandre Lautrette, Didier Gruson, Bertrand Souweine, Alexandre Boyeret al.",2021 Jun,Clin Ther,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34108081/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Data on aminoglycoside stewardship in critically ill septic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) needing intermittent hemodialysis (IH) are scarce. The first objective of the study was to evaluate whether aminoglycoside administration occurs before vs after IH in the real-life management of critically ill septic patients with AKI needing IH. The second objective was to assess the delay in achieving a potential reinjection window for a second dose of aminoglycoside, which should be obtained with a postdialysis vs predialysis regimen.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A post hoc observational analysis of a multicenter randomized trial of critically ill patients with AKI needing renal replacement therapy was conducted. Inclusion criteria consisted of any patients receiving IH for AKI during an antimicrobial therapy for a septic episode.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Among 206 of 341 septic patients (60%) receiving aminoglycosides, 90 underwent IH (46 with previous continuous renal replacement therapy and 44 without). Amikacin and gentamicin were administered for a mean (SD) of 2.2 (1.5) and 2.5 (2.1) days with mean (SD) doses of 20.6 (6.6) and 5.4 (2.5) mg/kg, respectively. In the 44 patients undergoing exclusive IH, aminoglycosides were administered in a predialysis in 53% of episodes versus 35% in a postdialysis schedule. The first Cmin target was obtained earlier with a predialysis vs postdialysis schedule (33.9 [14.2] hours vs 50.9 [12.2] hours, P = 0.009).
    


          Implications:
        
      
      Despite being less frequently used than a predialysis schedule, the postdialysis administration of aminoglycosides remains a regular practice in the intensive care unit. A predialysis schedule of administration in IH reduces the interval time to tolerable aminoglycoside redosing."
Renal dysfunction within 90 days of FluBu4 predicts early and late mortality.,"Karen Sweiss, Gregory S Calip, Annie L Oh, Damiano Rondelli, Pritesh R Patel, Karen Sweisset al.",2019 Jul,Bone Marrow Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30604772/,No keywords found,"Myeloablative conditioning regimens with significant extramedullary toxicity result in high rates of renal dysfunction including acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we examine the incidence and impact of a reduced creatinine clearance (below 60 ml/min) before day 90 (early renal dysfunction, ERD) in patients receiving the reduced toxicity fludarabine/i.v. busulfan (FluBu4) regimen prior to allogeneic transplant. Of 91 patients receiving FluBu4, 62 (68%) developed ERD. ERD resulted in worse overall survival (OS, 2.2 years versus median not reached, p = 0.04) and progression-free survival (PFS, 1.6 years versus median not reached, p = 0.02). This was due to a higher relapse rate (34% versus 14%, p = 0.03) in the ERD group. In time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, ERD was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-4.21, p = 0.043) and PFS (HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.17-4.28, p = 0.030). Patients with ERD surviving 1 year had an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR 10; 95% CI 1.4-112.6, p = 0.0181), which was associated with worse survival (3.2 years versus median not reached, p = 0.002). ERD after FluBu4 is therefore a poor prognostic sign resulting in increased relapse, worse OS, and high risk of CKD at 1 year."

      To evaluate if the increase in chloride intake during a continuous infusion of 20% hypertonic saline solution (HSS) is associated with an increase in the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to standard of care in traumatic brain injury patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this post hoc analysis of the COBI trial, 370 patients admitted for a moderate-to-severe TBI in the 9 participating ICUs were enrolled. The intervention consisted in a continuous infusion of HSS to maintain a blood sodium level between 150 and 155 mmol/L for at least 48 h. Patients enrolled in the control arm were treated as recommended by the latest Brain Trauma foundation guidelines. The primary outcome of this study was the occurrence of AKI within 28 days after enrollment. AKI was defined by stages 2 or 3 according to KDIGO criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After exclusion of missing data, 322 patients were included in this post hoc analysis. The patients randomized in the intervention arm received a significantly higher amount of chloride during the first 4 days (intervention group: 97.3 ± 31.6 g vs. control group: 61.3 ± 38.1 g; p < 0.001) and had higher blood chloride levels at day 4 (117.9 ± 10.7 mmol/L vs. 111.6 ± 9 mmol/L, respectively, p < 0.001). The incidence of AKI was not statistically different between the intervention and the control group (24.5% vs. 28.9%, respectively; p = 0.45).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite a significant increase in chloride intake, a continuous infusion of HSS was not associated with AKI in moderate-to-severe TBI patients. Our study does not confirm the potentially detrimental effect of chloride load on kidney function in ICU patients.

          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were randomly allocated to three groups and the target MAP level was strictly controlled to one of three levels: level I (65-79mmHg), level II (80-95mmHg), or level III (96-110mmHg).
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      The primary outcome was acute kidney injury (AKI) (50% or 0.3mg·dL-1increase in creatinine level) during the first 7 postoperative days. The secondary outcomes were perioperative adverse complications. Moreover, vasoactive agents were observed during surgery.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      The overall incidence of postoperative AKI was 10.9% (71/648). AKI occurred significantly less often in patients with level II MAP control (6.3%;13/206) than in patients with level I (13.5%; 31/230) and level III (12.9%; 27/210) (P<0.001) MAP control. Level II was associated with lower incidences of hospital-acquired pneumonia (6.7%; 14/206; P=0.014) and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (4.4%; 9/206; P=0.015) and with shorter length of stay in the ICU (P=0.025) when compared with level I and level III. Use of norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and nitroglycerin was significantly higher for patients with level III MAP control than for patients with level I and level II MAP control (P=0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      For elderly hypertensive patients, controlling intraoperative MAP levels to 80 to 95mmHg can reduce postoperative AKI after major abdominal surgery."

      There are no data from prospective studies focused exclusively on patients with advanced lung and thymic carcinoids. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of long-acting pasireotide and everolimus, administered alone or in combination, in patients with advanced carcinoids of the lung or thymus.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      LUNA was a prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial of adult patients (aged >18 years) with advanced (unresectable or metastatic), well differentiated carcinoid tumours of the lung or thymus, with radiological progression within 12 months before randomisation, and a WHO performance status of 0-2. At each centre, the investigator or their designee registered each patient using an interactive voice recognition system into one of the three treatment groups. The randomisation allocation sequence was generated by an external company; patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive treatment with long-acting pasireotide (60 mg intramuscularly every 28 days), everolimus (10 mg orally once daily), or both in combination, for the core 12-month treatment period. Patients were stratified by carcinoid type (typical vs atypical) and line of study treatment (first line vs others). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients progression-free at month 9, defined as the proportion of patients with overall lesion assessment at month 9 showing a complete response, partial response, or stable disease according to local Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01563354. The extension phase of the study is ongoing.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Aug 16, 2013, and Sept 30, 2014, 124 patients were enrolled from 36 centres in nine countries: 41 were allocated to the long-acting pasireotide group, 42 to the everolimus group, and 41 to the combination group. At month 9, the proportion of patients with an overall lesion assessment of complete response, partial response, or stable disease was 16 of 41 patients (39·0%, 95% CI 24·2-55·5) in the long-acting pasireotide group, 14 of 42 patients (33·3%, 19·6-49·5) in the everolimus group, and 24 of 41 patients (58·5%, 42·1-73·7) in the combination group. The most common grade 1-2 adverse events with a suspected association with long-acting pasireotide monotherapy were diarrhoea (15 [37%] of 41), hyperglycaemia (17 [41%]), and weight loss (8 [20%]); those with a suspected association with everolimus monotherapy were stomatitis (26 [62%] of 42) and diarrhoea (16 [38%]); and those suspected to be associated with combination treatment were hyperglycaemia (27 [66%] of 41]), diarrhoea (19 [46%]), and asthenia (8 [20%]). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events with a suspected association with long-acting pasireotide monotherapy were γ-glutamyltransferase increased (four [10%] of 41 patients), diarrhoea (three [7%]), and hyperglycaemia (three [7%]); those for everolimus were hyperglycaemia (seven [17%] of 42 patients), stomatitis (four [10%]), and diarrhoea (three [7%]); those for combination treatment were hyperglycaemia (nine [22%] of 41 patients) and diarrhoea (four [10%]). 11 patients died during the core 12-month treatment phase or up to 56 days after the last study treatment exposure date: two (5%) of 41 in the long-acting pasireotide group, six (14%) of 42 in the everolimus group, and three (7%) of 41 in the combination group. No deaths were suspected to be related to long-acting pasireotide treatment. One death in the everolimus group (acute kidney injury associated with diarrhoea), and two deaths in the combination group (diarrhoea and urinary sepsis in one patient, and acute renal failure and respiratory failure in one patient) were suspected to be related to everolimus treatment. In the latter patient, acute renal failure was not suspected to be related to everolimus treatment, but respiratory failure was suspected to be related.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      The study met the primary endpoint in all three treatment groups. Safety profiles were consistent with the known safety profiles of these agents. Further studies are needed to confirm the antitumour efficacy of the combination of a somatostatin analogue with everolimus in lung and thymic carcinoids.

      To evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of nanocurcumin supplementation in patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) undergoing induction chemotherapy.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 26 MIBC patients were randomized to receive either nanocurcumin (180 mg/day) or placebo during the course of chemotherapy. All patients were followed up to four weeks after the end of treatment to assess the complete clinical response to the chemotherapy as primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were the comparisons of chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, hematologic nadirs, and toxicities between the two groups. Hematologic nadirs and toxicities were assessed during the treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nanocurcumin was well tolerated. The complete clinical response rates were 30.8 and 50% in the placebo and nanocurcumin groups, respectively. Although nanocurcumin was shown to be superior to placebo with respect to complete clinical response rates as the primary endpoint, there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.417). No significant difference was also found between the two groups with regard to grade 3/4 renal and hematologic toxicities as well as hematologic nadirs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These preliminary data indicate the feasibility of nanocurcumin supplementation as a complementary therapy in MIBC patients and support further larger studies. Moreover, a substantial translational insight to fill the gap between the experiment and clinical practice in the field is provided."
"Gravity-assisted continuous flow peritoneal dialysis technique use in acute kidney injury in children: a randomized, crossover clinical trial.","Peter Nourse, Mignon McCulloch, Ashton Coetzee, Tim Bunchman, Stefano Picca, Jody Rusch, Andre Brooks, Hilton Heydenrych, Brenda Morrow, Peter Nourseet al.",2023 Aug,Pediatr Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36929384/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Our previously demonstrated continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD) technique in children with acute kidney injury (AKI), although effective, was manpower heavy and expensive due to the high-volume pumps required. The aim of this study was to develop and test a novel gravity-driven CFPD technique in children using readily available, inexpensive equipment and to compare this technique to conventional PD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      After development and initial in vitro testing, a randomised crossover clinical trial was conducted in 15 children with AKI requiring dialysis. Patients received both conventional PD and CFPD sequentially, in random order. Primary outcomes were measures of feasibility, clearance and ultrafiltration (UF). Secondary outcomes were complications and mass transfer coefficients (MTC). Paired t-tests were used to compare PD and CFPD outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median (range) age and weight of participants were 6.0 (0.2-14) months and 5.8 (2.3-14.0) kg, respectively. The CFPD system was easily and rapidly assembled. There were no serious adverse events attributed to CFPD. Mean ± SD UF was significantly higher on CFPD compared to conventional PD (4.3 ± 3.15 ml/kg/h vs. 1.04 ± 1.72 ml/kg/h; p < 0.001). Clearances for urea, creatinine and phosphate for children on CFPD were 9.9 ± 3.10 ml/min/1.73 m2, 7.9 ± 3.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 5.5 ± 1.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 compared to conventional PD with values of 4.3 ± 1.68 ml/min/1.73 m2, 3.57 ± 1.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 2.53 ± 0.85 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively (all p < 0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Gravity-assisted CFPD appears to be a feasible and effective way to augment ultrafiltration and clearances in children with AKI. It can be assembled from readily available non-expensive equipment. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information."

The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SPR741 were evaluated in two studies, after single and multiple intravenous (i.v.) doses in healthy adult subjects and after coadministration with partner antibiotics. In the single and multiple ascending-dose study, SPR741 or placebo was administered as a 1-h infusion at single doses of 5 to 800 mg and in multiple doses of 50 to 600 mg every 8 h (q8h) for 14 days. In the drug-drug interaction study, a single 400-mg i.v. dose of SPR741 was administered alone and in combination with piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. PK parameters for SPR741 and partner antibiotics were determined using noncompartmental analysis. After single doses, a dose-linear and proportional increase in mean maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was observed. At doses of 100 to 800 mg, >50% of the dose was excreted in the urine in the first 4 h postdose. After multiple doses, the mean half-life was 2.2 h on day 1 and up to 14.0 h on day 14, with no evidence of accumulation after 14 days of dosing up to 400 mg. The PK profile of SPR741 and partner antibiotics was unchanged with coadministration. SPR741 was generally well tolerated at doses up to 1,800 mg/day. These data support further clinical development of SPR741 for treating serious infections due to resistant bacteria.

N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicts the cardio-renal response to aliskiren in patients with type 2 diabetes at high renal and cardiovascular risk.,"Nienke M A Idzerda, Frederik Persson, Michelle J Pena, Barry M Brenner, Patrick Brunel, Nish Chaturvedi, John J McMurray, Hans-Henrik Parving, Dick de Zeeuw, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Nienke M A Idzerdaet al.",2018 Dec,Diabetes Obes Metab,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29987919/,"cardiovascular disease, clinical trial, diabetes complications, type 2 diabetes.","Sodium retention and volume overload are the main determinants of poor response to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition in patients with diabetes. As volume excess can exist without symptoms, biomarkers are needed to identify a priori which patients are volume overloaded and may experience less benefit from RAAS inhibition. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is released in the setting of increased cardiac wall stress and volume overload. We conducted a post hoc analysis among 5081 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participating in the ALTITUDE trial to investigate whether NTproBNP can predict the effects of additional therapy with aliskiren on cardio-renal endpoints. Aliskiren compared to placebo reduced the risk of the primary cardio-renal endpoint events by 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 61) and 2% (95% CI -42 to 30) in the two lowest NT-proBNP tertiles, and it increased the risk by 25% (95% CI -4 to 96) in the highest NT-proBNP tertile (P value for trend = 0.009). Similar trends were observed for the cardiovascular and end-stage renal disease endpoints. Effects of aliskiren compared to placebo on safety outcomes (hyperkalaemia and hospitalization for acute kidney injury) were independent of NT-proBNP. In conclusion, baseline NT-proBNP may be used as a marker to predict the response to aliskiren with regard to cardio-renal outcomes when added to standard therapy with RAAS inhibition."
High incidence of acute kidney injury during chemotherapy for childhood acute myeloid leukemia.,"Liezl Du Plessis, Shahrad Rod Rassekh, Cherry Mammen, Liezl Du Plessiset al.",2018 Apr,Pediatr Blood Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29286559/,No keywords found,"Background/objectives:
        
      
      Childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare and heterogeneous disease. Pediatric data on the epidemiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) in AML are limited. We report on the incidence of AKI in childhood AML and the risk factors associated with AKI episodes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective cohort of 53 patients (≤18 years), with de novo AML, receiving chemotherapy over a 10-year period. All serum creatinine (SCr) levels during therapy-related hospitalizations were assessed to stage AKI episodes as per Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Severe AKI was defined as AKI stages 2 or 3 and urine output criteria were not used. AKI risk factors were assessed independently in both cycle 1 alone and combining all chemotherapy cycles.
    


          Results:
        
      
      AKI developed in 34 patients (64%) with multiple AKI episodes in 10 patients (46 total episodes). Twenty-four severe AKI episodes occurred in 23 patients (43.4%) with a mean duration of 26.1 days (SD 7.3). In cycle 1, hyperleukocytosis was not predictive of AKI, but severe sepsis was an independent risk factor of severe AKI (odds ratio [OR]: 13.4; 95% CI 1.9-94.9). With cycles combined, all subjects with AKI had severe sepsis and older age (≥10 years) was associated with severe AKI (OR: 20.8; 95% CI 3.8-112.2).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There was a high incidence of AKI in our AML cohort with a strong association with older age (≥10 years) and severe sepsis. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the high burden of AKI and risk factors in this susceptible population."
A comparison of the effects of oral vs. intravenous hydration on subclinical acute kidney injury in living kidney donors: a protocol of a randomised controlled trial.,"Shona Mackinnon, Emma Aitken, Ryan Ghita, Marc Clancy, Shona Mackinnonet al.",2017 Jan 19,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28103829/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Optimal treatment for established renal failure is living donor kidney transplantation. However this pathway exposes healthy individuals to significant reduction in nephron mass via major surgical procedure. Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy is now the most common method for live donor transplantation, reducing both donor post-operative pain and recovery time. However this procedure exposes kidneys to additional haemodynamic stresses. It has been suggested that donor hydration-particularly the use of preoperative intravenous fluids-may counteract these stresses, reducing subclinical acute kidney injury and ultimately improving long-term renal function. This may be important in both preservation of donor renal function and recipient graft longevity.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      A prospective single-centre single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be carried out to determine the effects of donor preoperative intravenous fluids. The primary outcome is donor subclinical acute kidney injury (defined as plasma NGAL, >153 ng/ml) on day 1 postoperatively. Secondary outcomes include intraoperative haemodynamics, recipient subclinical acute kidney injury, perioperative complications and donor sleep quality. Donors will be randomised into two groups: the intervention group will receive active pre-hydration consisting of three litres of intravenous Hartmann's solution between midnight and 8 am before morning kidney donation, while the control group will not receive this. Both groups will receive unlimited oral fluids until midnight, as is routine. Plasma NGAL will be measured at pre-specified perioperative time points, intraoperative haemodynamic data will be collected using non-invasive cardiac output monitoring and clinical notes will be used to obtain demographic and clinical data. The researcher will be blinded to the donor fluid hydration status. Blinded statistical analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. A prospective power calculation estimates a required sample size of 86 patients.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This study will provide important data, as there is currently little evidence about the use of donor preoperative fluids in laparoscopic nephrectomy. It is hoped that the results obtained will guide future clinical practice.

      We aimed to evaluate the association between levosimendan treatment and acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as assess the clinical sequelae of AKI in cardiac surgery patients with depressed left ventricular function (ejection fraction <35%).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients in the LEVO-CTS trial undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve, or CABG/valve surgery were stratified by occurrence and severity of postoperative AKI using the AKIN classification. The association between levosimendan infusion and AKI was modeled using multivariable regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 854 LEVO-CTS patients, 231 (27.0%) experienced postoperative AKI, including 182 (21.3%) with stage 1, 35 (4.1%) with stage 2, and 14 (1.6%) with stage 3 AKI. The rate of AKI was similar between patients receiving levosimendan or placebo. The odds of 30-day mortality significantly increased by AKI stage compared to those without AKI (stage 1: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-4.9; stage 2: aOR 9.1, 95% CI 3.2-25.7; stage 3: aOR 12.4, 95% CI 3.0-50.4). No association was observed between levosimendan, AKI stage, and odds of 30-day mortality (interaction P = .69). Factors independently associated with AKI included increasing age, body mass index, diabetes, and increasing baseline systolic blood pressure. Increasing baseline eGFR and aldosterone antagonist use were associated with a lower risk of AKI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Postoperative AKI is common among high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery and associated with significantly increased risk of 30-day death or dialysis. Levosimendan was not associated with the risk of AKI."

      Despite concerns that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) contribute to acute kidney injury (AKI), up to 75% of ultramarathon runners ingest these during competition. The effect of NSAID on AKI incidence in ultramarathon runners is unclear.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Multisite randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial in the Gobi, Atacama, Ecuador and Sri Lankan deserts to determine whether ibuprofen (400 mg every 4 hours) would be non-inferior to placebo during a 50-mile (80 km) foot race. The primary outcome was incidence of AKI defined as severity categories of 'risk' of injury of 1.5× baseline creatinine (Cr) or 'injury' as 2× Cr, combined to calculate total incidence at the finish line. Non-inferiority margin for difference in AKI rates was defined as 15%.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eighty-nine participants (47% ibuprofen and 53% placebo) were enrolled with similar demographics between groups. The overall incidence of AKI was 44%. Intent-to-treat analysis found 22 (52%) ibuprofen versus 16 (34%) placebo users developed AKI (18% difference, 95% CI -4% to 41%; OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.9 to 5.1) with a number needed to harm of 5.5. Greater severity of AKI was seen with ibuprofen compared with placebo (risk=38% vs 26%; 95% CI -9% to 34%; injury=14% vs 9%; 95% CI -10% to 21%). Slower finishers were less likely to encounter AKI (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.98) and greater weight loss (-1.3%) increased AKI (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.63).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There were increased rates of AKI in those who took ibuprofen, and although not statistically inferior to placebo by a small margin, there was a number needed to harm of 5.5 people to cause 1 case of AKI. Consideration should therefore be taken before ingesting NSAID during endurance running as it could exacerbate renal injury.

No Differences in Renal Function between Balanced 6% Hydroxyethyl Starch (130/0.4) and 5% Albumin for Volume Replacement Therapy in Patients Undergoing Cystectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Tobias Kammerer, Florian Brettner, Sebastian Hilferink, Nikolai Hulde, Florian Klug, Judith-Irina Pagel, Alexander Karl, Alexander Crispin, Klaus Hofmann-Kiefer, Peter Conzen, Markus Rehm, Tobias Kammereret al.",2018 Jan,Anesthesiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29064872/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The use of artificial colloids has declined in critical care, whereas they are still used in perioperative medicine. Little is known about the nephrotoxic potential in noncritically ill patients during routine surgery. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the influences of albumin 5% and balanced hydroxyethyl starch 6% (130/0.4) on renal function and kidney injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred urologic patients undergoing elective cystectomy were randomly assigned for this prospective, single-blinded, controlled study with two parallel groups to receive either albumin 5% or balanced hydroxyethyl starch 6% (130/0.4) as the only perioperative colloid. The primary endpoint was the ratio of serum cystatin C between the last visit at day 90 and the first preoperative visit. Secondary endpoints were estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin until the third postoperative day and risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage renal disease criteria at postoperative days 3 and 90.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The median cystatin C ratio was 1.11 (interquartile range, 1.01 to 1.23) in the albumin and 1.08 (interquartile range, 1.00 to 1.20) in the hydroxyethyl starch group (median difference = 0.03; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.08; P = 0.165). Also, there were no significant differences concerning serum cystatin C concentrations; estimated glomerular filtration rate; risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage renal disease criteria; and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. Infusion requirements, transfusion rates, and perioperative hemodynamics were similar in both groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      With respect to renal function and kidney injury, this study indicates that albumin 5% and balanced hydroxyethyl starch 6% have comparable safety profiles in noncritically ill patients undergoing major surgery."

          Methods:
        
      
      PACKNOW was an open-label, randomized, controlled trial of acetaminophen (500 mg or 1000 mg every 6 hours for 72 hours) vs no acetaminophen in Malaysian patients aged ≥5 years with knowlesi malaria of any severity. The primary end point was change in creatinine at 72 hours. Secondary end points included longitudinal changes in creatinine in patients with severe malaria or acute kidney injury (AKI), stratified by hemolysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During 2016-2018, 396 patients (aged 12-96 years) were randomized to acetaminophen (n = 199) or no acetaminophen (n = 197). Overall, creatinine fell by a mean (standard deviation) 14.9% (18.1) in the acetaminophen arm vs 14.6% (16.0) in the control arm (P = .81). In severe disease, creatinine fell by 31.0% (26.5) in the acetaminophen arm vs 20.4% (21.5) in the control arm (P = .12), and in those with hemolysis by 35.8% (26.7) and 19% (16.6), respectively (P = .07). No difference was seen overall in patients with AKI; however, in those with AKI and hemolysis, creatinine fell by 34.5% (20.7) in the acetaminophen arm vs 25.9% (15.8) in the control arm (P = .041). Mixed-effects modeling demonstrated a benefit of acetaminophen at 72 hours (P = .041) and 1 week (P = .002) in patients with severe malaria and with AKI and hemolysis (P = .027 and P = .002, respectively).

          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a secondary analysis of immunocompromised patients enrolled in the ALBIOS trial which randomized patients with severe sepsis or septic shock to receive either 20% albumin (target 30 g per liter or more) and crystalloid or crystalloid alone during ICU stay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 1818 patients originally enrolled, 304 (16.4%) were immunocompromised. One-hundred-thirty-nine (45.7%) patients were randomized in the albumin while 165 (54.2%) in the crystalloid group. At 90 days, 69 (49.6%) in the albumin group and 89 (53.9%) in the crystalloids group died (hazard ratio - HR - 0.94; 95% CI 0.69-1.29). No differences were observed with regards to 28-day mortality, SOFA score (and sub-scores), length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital, proportion of patients who had developed acute kidney injury or received renal replacement therapy, duration of mechanical ventilation. Albumin was not independently associated with a higher or lower 90-day mortality (HR 0.979, 95% CI 0.709-1.352) as compared to crystalloid.

PKPD Modeling and Dosing Considerations in Advanced Ovarian Cancer Patients Treated with Cisplatin-Based Intraoperative Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.,"Feifan Xie, Jan Van Bocxlaer, Pieter Colin, Charlotte Carlier, Olivier Van Kerschaver, Joseph Weerts, Hannelore Denys, Philippe Tummers, Wouter Willaert, Wim Ceelen, An Vermeulen, Feifan Xieet al.",2020 Jul 24,AAPS J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32710204/,"HIPEC, NONMEM, PKPD, cisplatin, ovarian cancer.","Intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (IPEC) of cisplatin is a popular treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, typically under hyperthermia (HIPEC). The use of cisplatin under (H)IPEC is off-label, and the role of hyperthermia is unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) properties of cisplatin under (H)IPEC and to predict the optimal treatment regimen. Using a randomized design, data on intact cisplatin perfusate and plasma concentrations, leukocyte counts-a hematotoxicity marker-and serum creatinine-a nephrotoxicity marker-were collected from 50 patients treated with a combination of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and either normothermic or hyperthermic IPEC of cisplatin dosed at 75, 100, and 120 mg/m2. The non-linear mixed effects modeling technique was used to construct the PKPD models. The PK of intact cisplatin was characterized by a two-compartment model. A semi-physiological myelosuppression model for the leukopenia was modified to account for the CRS-induced leukocytosis and the residual myelosuppression effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The incidence and severity of nephrotoxicity were described by a discrete-time Markov model. Hyperthermia increased the absorption rate of cisplatin by 16.3% but did not show a clinically relevant impact on the investigated toxicities compared with normothermia. Leukopenia was not severe, but nephrotoxicity can become severe or life-threatening and was affected by the dose and IPEC duration.

Kidney Injury after Intravenous versus Intra-arterial Contrast Agent in Patients Suspected of Having Coronary Artery Disease: A Randomized Trial.,"Eva Schönenberger, Peter Martus, Maria Bosserdt, Elke Zimmermann, Rudolf Tauber, Michael Laule, Marc Dewey, Eva Schönenbergeret al.",2019 Sep,Radiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31264950/,No keywords found,"Background In the absence of randomized studies, it has been controversial whether the likelihood of acute kidney injury (AKI) differs between intravenous and intra-arterial contrast agent administration. Purpose To compare intravenous versus intra-arterial contrast agent administration in relationship to AKI and analyze the association between AKI and chronic kidney disease (defined as at least mildly decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates [eGFRs]). Materials and Methods This was a prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00844220) that involved randomizing participants with atypical chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) between February 2009 and August 2015 to undergo coronary CT angiography with intravenous contrast agent administration or cardiac catheterization angiography with intra-arterial contrast agent administration. This prespecified secondary analysis compared AKI (serum creatinine increase of ≥ 25% or 0.5 mg/dL after 18-24 or 46-50 hours) determined by blinded investigators using absolute differences and relative risks, including two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results A total of 320 participants (163 [50.9%] women; mean age, 60 years ± 11) were included. Baseline eGFR did not differ between the CT angiography group (84.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 ± 17.2) and the catheterization group (87.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 ± 16.7) (P = .14). AKI occurred in nine of 161 participants in the CT angiography group (5.6%; 95% CI: 3%, 10%) and in 21 of 159 participants in the catheterization group (13.2%; 95% CI: 9%,19%) (relative risk, 2.4; 95% CI: 1.1, 5.0; P = .02). Also in the subgroup of participants without obstructive CAD, in those not requiring coronary interventions, AKI was more common in the catheterization group (11.9%; 95% CI: 8%, 19%) than in the CT angiography group (4.3% [95% CI: 2%, 9%]; difference, 7.7% [95% CI: 1.3%, 14.1%]; relative risk, 2.8 [95% CI: 1.1, 7.0]; P = .02). Obstructive CAD (odds ratio [OR]: 2.7 [95% CI: 1.1, 6.6]; P = .02), femoral catheter access (OR: 2.5 [95% CI: 1.1, 5.6]; P = .04), and cine ventriculography were associated with AKI (OR: 2.3 [95% CI: 1.0, 4.9]; P = .03). In multivariable analysis, the presence of postcontrast AKI was associated with chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio: 12.4 [95% CI: 4.5, 34.6]; P < .01). Conclusion Acute kidney injury was more common after cardiac catheterization than after CT angiography in this prospective randomized study of patients suspected of having coronary artery disease. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Efficacy and safety of a balanced salt solution versus a 0.9% saline infusion for the prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (BASIC trial): a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Hyung Ah Jo, Sehoon Park, Chan-Duck Kim, Hee-Yeon Jung, Jang-Hee Cho, Ran-Hui Cha, Ea Wha Kang, Tae Ik Chang, Sejoong Kim, Hyung-Jong Kim, Byung Ha Chung, Jung Pyo Lee, Jung Tak Park, Seung Hyeok Han, Tae-Hyun Yoo, Dong-Ryeol Ryu, Sung Jin Moon, Jae Hyun Chang, Dong Ki Kim, Kwon Wook Joo, Hyung Ah Joet al.",2017 Oct 5,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28982378/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is one of the most common causes of iatrogenic kidney injury and, therefore, its prevention is an important issue. However, whether the administration of 0.9% saline is the optimal prophylaxis method remains uncertain due to its supra-physiologic chloride component. In particular, recent studies suggest that chloride-restricted solutions showed superiority over 0.9% saline in several clinical settings.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      The investigators designed a multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of a balanced salt solution and 0.9% saline in CI-AKI prophylaxis. This study will recruit patients who are scheduled for contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans with CI-AKI prophylaxis. In this study, participants will be randomized into two study arms; the study group will receive a balanced salt solution, and the control group will receive 0.9% saline. Fluids will be administered as designated in the protocol before and after the CT scan, and an evaluation of baseline clinical status will be performed by obtaining blood and urine samples. During the follow-up visits, the incidence of CI-AKI and long-term outcomes, including the start of renal replacement therapy or all-cause mortality, will be assessed.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      To our knowledge, this study will be the first study assessing the preventive value of a balanced salt solution over 0.9% saline for CI-AKI. If the trial shows that the balanced salt solution is as effective for CI-AKI prophylaxis as 0.9% saline, the use of the balanced salt solution could be promoted due to the reduced possibility of consequent metabolic acidosis compared to 0.9% saline.

The D1/D5 Dopamine Partial Agonist PF-06412562 in Advanced-Stage Parkinson's Disease: A Feasibility Study.,"Xuemei Huang, Mechelle M Lewis, Lauren Jodi Van Scoy, Sol De Jesus, Paul J Eslinger, Amy C Arnold, Amanda J Miller, Julio Fernandez-Mendoza, Bethany Snyder, William Harrington, Lan Kong, Xi Wang, Dongxiao Sun, Marielle Delnomdedieu, Sridhar Duvvuri, Susan E Mahoney, David L Gray, Richard B Mailman, Xuemei Huanget al.",2020,J Parkinsons Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32986682/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Current drug treatments have little efficacy in advanced-to-end-stage Parkinson's disease (advPD), yet there are no reports of interventional trials in advPD. D1 dopamine agonists have the potential to provide benefit.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine the feasibility and safety of the selective D1/D5 dopamine partial agonist PF 06412562 in advPD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A two-week, randomized, double blind, crossover phase Ib study in advPD patients compared standard-of-care (SoC) carbidopa/levodopa with PF 06412562. Each week, there was a Day 1 baseline evaluation with overnight levodopa washout, then treatment on Days 2 and 3 with either SoC or PF-06412562 (split dose 25 + 20 mg), followed by discharge on Day 4. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints were global clinical impression of change (GCI-C) rated by clinicians and caregivers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight advPD patients and their caregivers consented to participate and six were randomized (average disease duration: 22 y). None withdrew voluntarily. One participant with baseline Day 1 dehydration, pre-renal kidney injury, and autonomic dysfunction experienced symptomatic and serious hypotension after receiving PF-06412562 in Week 1 and was discontinued from the study. All other adverse events were rated mild (PF-06412562: n = 1, SoC: n = 0), moderate (PF-06412562: n = 1, SoC: n = 1), or severe but non-serious (PF-06412562: n = 3, SoC: n = 2). No clinically meaningful laboratory changes were observed. Among the five participants who completed the study, GCI-C favored PF-06412562 in two per clinicians' and four participants per caregivers' rating.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      PF-06412562 was tolerated in advPD patients. This study provides the feasibility for future safety and efficacy studies in this population with unmet needs."
Pharmacokinetics of initial full and subsequent reduced doses of S-1 in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer-effect of renal insufficiency.,"Tomoko Yamazaki, Makoto Tahara, Tomohiro Enokida, Tetsuro Wakasugi, Satoko Arahira, Sadamoto Zenda, Atsushi Motegi, Tetsuo Akimoto, Kunihiro Yoshisue, Tomoko Yamazakiet al.",2017 May 1,Jpn J Clin Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28159957/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      S-1 is a combination of tegafur [metabolized to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)] with the modulators gimeracil (5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine) and oteracil potassium. 5-Chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine maintains plasma 5-FU concentrations by inhibiting dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, a pyrimidine catabolism enzyme that degrades 5-FU. As 50% of 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine is excreted in urine, renal insufficiency may increase its blood level, increasing 5-FU concentrations. We investigated whether special dose modification is needed in the presence of renal insufficiency.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We compared steady state pharmacokinetics of 5-FU for the initial S-1 dose and reduced doses in patients with head and neck cancer requiring dose reduction due to renal and non-renal toxicities.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Chemoradiotherapy with S-1 and cisplatin was administered every 5 weeks for two courses with a radiation dose totaling 70 Gy over 33-35 fractions. Two additional courses of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered in the case of an objective response. The S-1 and/or cisplatin dose was reduced in response to renal, hematologic or other toxicities. The primary endpoint was the change in area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve from time 0-10 hours (5-FU AUCss 0-10) between the initial and reduced S-1 doses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Although the mean 5-FU levels in patients with non-renal toxicities significantly decreased between the full and reduced dose, the full-dose and reduced-dose mean maximum 5-FU plasma concentrations at steady state (Css max) and AUCss 0-10 in patients with renal insufficiency were similar.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Standard S-1 dose reduction for renal toxicity did not result in a significant decrease in 5-FU levels at steady state. A greater reduction to lower plasma 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine may be necessary in patients with renal insufficiency."
Effects of Balanced Versus Saline-based Solutions on Acute Kidney Injury in Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Jae-Sik Nam, Wook-Jong Kim, Wan-Woo Seo, Sang-Wook Lee, Kyung-Woon Joung, Ji-Hyun Chin, Dae-Kee Choi, In-Cheol Choi, Jae-Sik Namet al.",2024 Sep,J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38960803/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      To determine whether balanced solutions can reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury after off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery compared with saline.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Randomized controlled trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Single tertiary care center.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery between June 2014 and July 2020.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Balanced solution-based chloride-restrictive intravenous fluid strategy.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      The primary outcome was acute kidney injury within 7 postoperative days, as defined by the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline. The incidence of acute kidney injury was 4.4% (8/180) in the balanced group and 7.3% (13/178) in the saline group. The difference was not statistically significant (risk difference, -2.86%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.72% to 2.01%; risk ratio, 0.61, 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.43; p = 0.35). Compared with the balanced group, the saline group had higher levels of intraoperative serum chloride and lower base excess, which resulted in a lower pH.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients undergoing off-pump bypass surgery with a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate, the intraoperative balanced solution-based chloride-restrictive intravenous fluid administration strategy did not decrease the rate of postoperative acute kidney injury compared with the saline-based chloride-liberal intravenous fluid administration strategy."
Is ciprofloxacin safe in patients with solitary kidney and upper urinary tract infection?,"Gheorghe Gluhovschi, Florica Gadalean, Cristina Gluhovschi, Silvia Velciov, Ligia Petrica, Flaviu Bob, Gheorghe Bozdog, Adriana Kaycsa, Gheorghe Gluhovschiet al.",2016 Dec:84:366-372.,Biomed Pharmacother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27668536/,"Biomarkers, Ciprofloxacin, Glomerular filtration rate, Nephrotoxicity, Solitary kidney.","The solitary kidney (SK) undergoes adaptive phenomena of hyperfunction and hyperfiltration. These secondary adaptive phenomena can make it more vulnerable to potentially nephrotoxic therapies. Adverse reactions of the kidneys to ciprofloxacin are rare, but sometimes severe. Therefore, our study sought to assess the reactions to ciprofloxacin of patients with solitary kidney (SK) and urinary tract infection (UTI) by means of urinary biomarkers. We studied 19 patients with SK and urinary tract infection (UTI) who had been administered a 7-day treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin. Urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase, alpha 1-microglobulin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of these patients were measured at the initiation and at the end of treatment. In 47.37% patients NAG diminished under ciprofloxacin treatment. This observation has the significance of favourable evolution of the tubulointerstitial lesions caused by UTI and lack of nephrotoxic effects; 52.63% cases presented an increase of urinary NAG, a fact that suggests a nephrotoxic effect of ciprofloxacin. The evolution of urinary alpha 1-microglobulin was similar to that one of urinary NAG. Only one of three cases with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 presented acute kidney injury, associated with increase in the tubular markers. In spite of the high variability of the urinary biomarkers, UTI evolved favourably in these cases; eGFR increased in 16 out of 19 patients, a fact which is indicative of a good outcome of renal function, even in patients with elevated levels of the tubular damage biomarkers. This observation supports the hypothesis that eGFR may be dissociated from the biomarkers which assess tubular injury. In SK patients the occurrence of AKI is not frequent, although the urinary biomarkers rise in some patients treated with ciprofloxacin. This is related not only to the nephrotoxic effect of the drug, but probably to the association of other factors (allergy, individual susceptibility). In SK patients, renal tubular biomarkers, especially NAG, allow monitoring of tubular injury and impose caution in prescribing ciprofloxacin treatment, mainly to patients at risk. Ciprofloxacin is relatively safe regarding its nephrotoxicity, while caution is required in vulnerable patients."
Oxaliplatin and Doxorubicin for relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.,"Hung C Tran, Araz Marachelian, Rajkumar Venkatramani, Rima F Jubran, Leo Mascarenhas, Hung C Tranet al.",2015 Feb,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25551355/,"Chemotherapy, doxorubicin, neuroblastoma, oxaliplatin, pediatric oncology.","Patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma have poor long-term survival. New therapeutic regimens are needed. Doxorubicin and cisplatin are commonly used in the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound with a 1,2-diaminocyclohexan carrier ligand, is more potent than cisplatin with less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. We treated seven relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma patients using oxaliplatin (105-130 mg/m(2)) and doxorubicin (60-75 mg/m(2)) together with dexrazoxane (10 mg/mg of doxorubicin) administered intravenously every three weeks. Prolonged thrombocytopenia causing treatment delay was observed when oxaliplatin was administered at 130 mg/m(2). A reduced dose of oxaliplatin 105 mg/m(2) on day 1 with doxorubicin at 20 mg/m(2)/dose on days 1-3 was well tolerated. Sensory neuropathies were mild and transient. No cardiotoxicity was noted despite all patients having a history of prior anthracycline exposure. Best responses included 1 complete response, 1 partial response, 1 mixed response, 3 stable diseases. In our cohort of heavily pretreated relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma patients, the combination of oxaliplatin and doxorubicin demonstrated anti-tumor activity and merits further investigation."
"A Practice-Based, Clinical Pharmacokinetic Study to Inform Levetiracetam Dosing in Critically Ill Patients Undergoing Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration (PADRE-01).","Shamir N Kalaria, Michael Armahizer, Paul McCarthy, Neeraj Badjatia, Jogarao V Gobburu, Mathangi Gopalakrishnan, Shamir N Kalariaet al.",2020 Sep,Clin Transl Sci,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32223067/,No keywords found,"Limited data exist on the effect of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) methods on anti-epileptic drug pharmacokinetics (PK). This prospective practice-based PK study aims to assess the impact of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), a modality of CRRT, on levetiracetam PK in critically ill patients and to derive individualized dosing recommendations. Eleven patients receiving oral or intravenous levetiracetam and CVVH in various intensive care units at a large academic medical center were enrolled to investigate the need for dosing adjustments. Prefilter, postfilter, and ultrafiltrate samples were obtained before dosing, after the completion of the infusion or 1-hour postoral dose, and up to 6 additional time points postinfusion or postoral administration. Patient-specific blood and ultrafiltrate flow rates and laboratory values were also collected at the time of sampling. The average sieving coefficient (SC) for levetiracetam was 0.89 ± 0.1, indicating high filter efficiency. Six of the 11 patients experienced concentrations outside the reported therapeutic range (12-46 mg/L). The average volume of distribution was 0.73 L/kg. CVVH clearance contributes a major fraction of the total levetiracetam clearance (36-73%) in neurocritically ill patients. The average bias and precision of the estimated vs. observed total clearance value was ~ 10.6% and 21.5%. Major dose determinants were identified to be SC and effluent flow rate. Patients with higher ultrafiltrate rates will have increased drug clearance and, therefore, will require higher doses in order to match exposures seen in patients with normal renal function."
Mechanisms of action of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin on tubular inflammation and damage: A post hoc mediation analysis of the CANVAS trial.,"Taha Sen, Akihiko Koshino, Bruce Neal, Maarten J Bijlsma, Clare Arnott, Jingwei Li, Michael K Hansen, Joachim H Ix, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Taha Senet al.",2022 Oct,Diabetes Obes Metab,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35635326/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      To test the hypothesis that the reduction in urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) observed with the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin is mediated through its effects on urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) by assessing the proportion of the effect of canagliflozin on KIM-1 that is mediated through its effects on MCP-1 and UACR in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric kidney disease.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      We measured KIM-1 and MCP-1 levels in urine samples from the CANVAS trial at baseline and Week 52 with the Mesoscale QuickPlex SQ 120 platform. KIM-1 and MCP-1 were standardized by urinary creatinine (Cr). The proportion of the effect of canagliflozin that is mediated through UACR and MCP-1/Cr on KIM-1/Cr was estimated with G-computation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 763 patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria (17.6% of the total cohort) were included. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the canagliflozin and placebo group. At Year 1, canagliflozin compared to placebo reduced UACR, MCP-1/Cr and KIM-1/Cr by 40.4% (95% CI 31.0, 48.4), 18.1% (95% CI 8.9, 26.4) and 30.9% (95% CI 23.0, 38.0), respectively. The proportion of the effect of canagliflozin on KIM-1/Cr mediated by its effect on UACR and in turn on MCP-1/Cr was 15.2% (95% CI 9.4, 24.5).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Canagliflozin reduces urinary KIM-1, suggesting decreased tubular damage. This effect was partly mediated through a reduction in MCP-1, indicative of reduced tubular inflammation, which was in turn mediated by a reduction in UACR. This post hoc analysis suggests that urinary albumin leakage may lead to tubular inflammation and induction of injury, and provide mechanistic insight for how canagliflozin may ameliorate tubular damage, but further research is required to confirm these findings."
Acute kidney injury with hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.42 in severe sepsis.,"R B Müller, N Haase, T Lange, J Wetterslev, A Perner, R B Mülleret al.",2015 Mar,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25524831/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      We aimed to detail the effects of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) vs. Ringer's on kidney function including the interaction with mortality in post-hoc analyses as resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 increased mortality in the Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock (6S) trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In all 798 randomised patients, we assessed the incidence and effect on mortality of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the HES vs. Ringer's acetate groups using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome criteria. We also assessed the intervention effect on time to and duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT).
    


          Results:
        
      
      At baseline, the intervention groups were similar. The maximal AKI stage was higher in the HES vs. Ringer's group within the first 5 days after randomisation (P = 0.03), the average difference being 0.2 points (P < 0.01). An increase in AKI stage was associated with mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.35; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.49; P < 0.01). Significantly, more patients in the HES group received RRT within the first 5 days (P = 0.01), and the time to initiation of RRT was also shorter compared with the Ringer's group (HR 1.40; 95% CI 1.01-1.93; P = 0.04). The intervention effect of HES on mortality was reduced when adjusting for AKI stage as a time-dependent covariate (P = 0.15).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In patients with severe sepsis, HES appeared to increase the rate of severe AKI and use of RRT within the first 5 days. The increased mortality observed with HES may have been partly mediated through acute kidney impairment."
Chronic Pain Treatment With Cannabidiol in Kidney Transplant Patients in Uruguay.,"L Cuñetti, L Manzo, R Peyraube, J Arnaiz, L Curi, S Orihuela, L Cuñettiet al.",2018 Mar,Transplant Proc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29579828/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Chronic pain is a major therapeutic problem in kidney transplant patients owing to nephrotoxicity associated with nonsteroidal antiiflammatory drugs. Benefits in chronic pain treatment with cannabidiol (CBD) have been reported. This study assesses the effect, safety, and possible drug interactions in kidney transplant patients treated with CBD for chronic pain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We assessed patients who asked to receive CBD for pain treatment. Doses were increased from 50 to 150 mg twice a day for 3 weeks. Creatinine, blood count, liver function, liver enzymes, and drug levels were determined every 48 hours the first week and then once a week thereafter.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We assessed 7 patients with a mean age of 64.5 years (range, 58-75 years). CBD initial dose was 100 mg/d, CBD dose reduction to 50 mg/d has been done on day 4 to patient 1 for persistent nausea. Tacrolimus dose reduction in patient 3 was undertaken on days 4, 7, and 21 owing to persisting elevated levels (even before CBD) and itching, and on day 21 in patient 5. Tacrolimus levels decreased in patient 2 but were normal in the control 1 week later. Patients on cyclosporine were stable. Adverse effects were nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, and intermittent episodes of heat. CBD dose decrease was required in 2 patients. Two patients had total pain improvement, 4 had a partial response in the first 15 days, and in 1 there was no change.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      During this follow-up, CBD was well-tolerated, and there were no severe adverse effects. Plasma levels of tacrolimus were variable. Therefore, longer follow-up is required."
Effect of post-operative goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) on organ function after orthotopic liver transplantation: Secondary outcome analysis of the COLT randomised control trial.,"Farid Froghi, Vignesh Gopalan, Zachos Anastasiou, Rahul Koti, Kurinchi Gurusamy, Christine Eastgate, Margaret McNeil, Helder Filipe, Manuel Pinto, Jeshika Singh, Louise Longworth, Susan Mallett, Nick Schofield, Douglas Thorburn, Daniel Martin, Brian R Davidson;, COLT Study Group, Farid Froghiet al.",2022 Mar:99:106265.,Int J Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35181556/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) has been shown to reduce the complications following a variety of major surgical procedures, possibly mediated by improved organ perfusion and function. We have shown that it is feasible to randomise patients to GDFT or standard fluid management following liver transplant in the cardiac-output optimisation following liver transplantation (COLT) trial. The current study compares end organ function in patients from the COLT trial who received GDFT in comparison to those receiving standard care (SC) following liver transplant.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Adult patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing liver transplantation were randomised to GDFT or SC for the first 12 h following surgery as detailed in a published trial protocol. GDFT protocol was based on stroke volume (SV) optimisation using 250 ml crystalloid boluses. Total fluid administration and time to extubation were recorded. Hourly SV and cardiac output (CO) readings were recorded from the non-invasive cardiac output monitoring (NICOM) device in both groups. Pulmonary function was assessed by arterial blood gas (ABG) and ventilatory parameters. Lung injury was assessed using PaO2:FiO2 ratios and calculated pulmonary compliance. The KDIGO score was used for determining acute kidney injury. Renal and liver graft function were assessed during the post-operative period and at 3 months and 1-year.
    


          Results:
        
      
      60 patients were randomised to GDFT (n = 30) or SC (n = 30). All patients completed the 12 h intervention period. GDFT group received a significantly higher total volume of fluid during the 12 h trial intervention period (GDFT 5317 (2335) vs. SC 3807 (1345) ml, p = 0.003); in particular crystalloids (GDFT 3968 (2073) vs. SC 2510 (1027) ml, p = 0.002). There was no evidence of significant difference between the groups in SV or CO during the assessment periods. Time to extubation, PaO2: FIO2 ratios, pulmonary compliance, ventilatory or blood gas measurements were similar in both groups. There was a significant rise in serum creatinine from baseline (77 μmol/L) compared to first (87 μmol/L, p = 0.039) and second (107 μmol/L, p = 0.001) post-operative days. There was no difference between GDFT and SC in the highest KDIGO scores for the first 7 days post-LT. At 1-year follow-up, there was no difference in need for renal replacement therapy or graft function.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this randomised trial of fluid therapy post liver transplant, GDFT was associated with an increased volume of crystalloids administered but did not alter early post-operative pulmonary or renal function when compared with standard care."
Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Optimization for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Patients (ROAD-HF): Rationale and Design.,"Bhagwan Dass, Michelle Dimza, Girish Singhania, Cody Schwartz, Jerin George, Avni Bhatt, Nila Radhakrishnan, Asha Bansari, Shahab Bozorgmehri, Rajesh Mohandas, Bhagwan Dasset al.",2020 Aug,Am J Cardiovasc Drugs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31797310/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      The long-term benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on outcomes in patients with chronic congestive heart failure are well-known, making them one of the most widely prescribed medications. However, the administration of ACEIs/ARBs in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality secondary to worsening renal function (WRF). A decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during the treatment of ADHF has been associated with an increase in mortality proportional to the degree of WRF.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      The aim of our study is to determine whether withholding ACEIs/ARBs during the initial 72 h of admission in patients with ADHF will prevent WRF and allow more effective diuresis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Four hundred and thirty patients will be randomized to the intervention (withholding ACEIs/ARBs) or control (continue/start ACEIs/ARBs) arms for 72 h. Primary outcomes include rates of acute kidney injury (AKI), patient global assessment, and change in kinetic eGFR over 72 h, while secondary outcomes include change in weight, fluid balance, change in signs and symptoms of congestion, change in renal function, change in urinary biomarkers (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 [TIMP-2] × insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 [IGFBP7]), patients experiencing treatment failure, hospital length of stay (LOS), cost analysis, mortality within 30 days, and hospital readmissions over 30 days and 1 year.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This prospective clinical trial will prove if withholding ACEIs/ARBs will prevent AKI in ADHF. It will help us understand the complex interactions between the heart and kidney, and delineate the best treatment strategy for ADHF. Holding ACEIs/ARBs might help preserve renal function, and decrease hospital LOS, readmission rates, and cost of care in ADHF.

      To evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab and gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of esophageal cancer and the effect on the incidence of adverse reactions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 100 esophageal cancer patients admitted to our hospital from March 2019 to March 2021 were identified as research subjects and randomized into the control group and the study group, with 50 cases in each group. The control group was treated with gemcitabine combined with cisplatin, and the study group was treated with the triple therapy of bevacizumab, gemcitabine, and cisplatin. The treatment efficiency and the incidence of adverse reactions were compared between the two groups of patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total treatment efficiency in the study group was 86%, which was significantly higher than that of 66% in the control group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Cyfra21-1, and C-met were reduced in both groups, with significantly lower levels in the study group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of all CTCAE, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity was comparable between the two groups (P > 0.05). The survival rates of patients in the study group were 88% and 54% at 1 and 2 years after treatment, which were significantly higher than that of 68% and 32% in the control group (P < 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The clinical efficiency of bevacizumab and gemcitabine combined with cisplatin in the treatment of esophageal cancer is remarkable, which improves the survival of patients, and is worthy of clinical promotion and application."
The effects of vitamin E on colistin-induced nephrotoxicity in treatment of drug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections: A randomized clinical trial.,"Maryam Samsami, Minoosh Shabani, Mohammadreza Hajiesmaeili, Maria Tavakoli-Ardakani, Seyed Hossein Ardehali, Alireza Fatemi, Saghar Barati, Omid Moradi, Zahra Sahraei, Maryam Samsamiet al.",2021 Aug,J Infect Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33863635/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Nephrotoxicity remains a major long-standing concern for colistin, and it is critical to find agents that can prevent it. The present study aims to investigate the effect of vitamin E on the prevention of colistin-induced nephrotoxicity based on its antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A randomized clinical trial was designed for 52 patients taking colistin. These patients were categorized into two groups of equal size, receiving colistin or colistin plus vitamin E (α-Tocopherol). Vitamin E with doses of 400 units was administrated daily either orally or by a nasogastric tube if needed. The incidence of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and its duration was recorded based on RIFLE criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The Incidence of AKI based on RIFLE criteria was 42.3% and 46.2% in intervention and control groups, respectively. The analysis showed no significant difference in the prevalence of AKI for the two groups (P = 0.78). There was no significant difference in the duration of AKI neither (P = 0.83).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although vitamin E is a powerful biological antioxidant, the effects of Vitamin E prophylaxis on colistin-induced nephrotoxicity was not taken into consideration in this study."
Adequate nephroprotection reduces renal complications after hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy.,"Till Markowiak, Nadine Kerner, Reiner Neu, Tobias Potzger, Christian Großer, Florian Zeman, Hans-Stefan Hofmann, Michael Ried, Till Markowiaket al.",2019 Dec,J Surg Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31602673/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy (HITOC) is used for the treatment of malignant pleural tumors. Although HITOC proved to be safe, postoperative renal failure due to nephrotoxicity of intrapleural cisplatin remains a concern.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This single-center study was performed retrospectively in patients who underwent pleural tumor resection and HITOC between September 2008 and December 2018.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 84 patients (female n = 33; 39.3%) with malignant pleural tumors underwent surgical cytoreduction with subsequent HITOC (60 minutes; 42°C). During the study period, we gradually increased the dosage of cisplatin (100-150 mg/m2 BSA n = 36; 175 mg/m2 BSA n = 2) and finally added doxorubicin (cisplatin 175 mg/m2 BSA/doxorubicin 65 mg; n = 46). All patients had perioperative fluid balancing. The last 54 (64.3%) patients also received perioperative cytoprotection. Overall 29 patients (34.5%) experienced renal insufficiency. Despite higher cisplatin concentrations, patients with cytoprotection showed significantly lower postoperative serum creatinine levels after 1 week (P = .006) and at discharge (P = .020). Also, they showed less intermediate and severe renal insufficiencies (5.6% vs 13.3%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Adequate perioperative fluid management and cytoprotection seem to be effective in protecting renal function. This allows the administration of higher intracavitary cisplatin doses without raising the rate of renal insufficiencies."
Reduction in acute kidney injury stage predicts survival in patients with type-1 hepatorenal syndrome.,"Florence Wong, Thomas D Boyer, Arun J Sanyal, Stephen C Pappas, Shannon Escalante, Khurram Jamil, Florence Wonget al.",2020 Sep 1,Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30887050/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1), a form of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis, has a median survival of days to weeks if untreated. The impact of reduction in AKI stage on overall survival in cirrhosis, independent of HRS reversal, is unclear.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Randomized, placEbo-controlled, double-blind study to confirm the reVERSal of HRS-1 with terlipressin study assessed terlipressin versus placebo, both with albumin, as treatment for HRS-1 for ≤14 days. Renal dysfunction severity was categorized by AKI stage at enrollment. Baseline patient characteristics were evaluated as predictors of AKI improvement using a multivariate model; the association between AKI stage reduction and 90-day survival was assessed using linear regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 184 patients (terlipressin: n = 91; placebo: n = 93) with similar numbers in AKI Stages 1-3 (terlipressin/placebo, Stage 1: n = 25/26; Stage 2: n = 35/33; Stage 3: n = 31/34) were included. Predictors of AKI improvement were absence of alcoholic hepatitis, baseline serum creatinine and male gender. Overall survival was not significantly different across AKI stages (range 53-65%). In patients with no AKI worsening, 90-day survival was consistently better when AKI improved independent of HRS reversal, regardless of the initial AKI stage, with patients with Stage 1 at initial diagnosis achieving the greatest clinical benefit. A significant association was observed between AKI reduction and overall 90-day survival (P = 0.0022).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A reduction in AKI stage, independent of HRS reversal, was sufficient to improve overall survival in patients with HRS-1. The goal for HRS-1 treatment should be less stringent than absolute HRS reversal."

We added brentuximab vedotin (BV) to DHAP to improve the mCR rate. In a Phase I dose-escalation part in 12 patients, we showed that BV-DHAP is feasible. This Phase II study included 55 R/R cHL patients (23 primary refractory). Treatment consisted of three 21-day cycles of BV 1.8 mg/kg on day 1, and DHAP (dexamethasone 40mg days 1-4, cisplatin 100mg/m2; day 1 and cytarabine 2x2g/m2; day 2). Patients with a metabolic partial response (mPR) or mCR proceeded to HDC/auto-PBSCT. Based on independent central FDG-PET-CT review, 42 of 52 evaluable patients (81% [95% CI: 67-90]) achieved an mCR before HDC/auto-PBSCT, five had an mPR and five had progressive disease (three were not evaluable). After HDC/auto-PBSCT, four patients with an mPR converted to an mCR. The 2-year PFS was 74% [95% CI: 63-86], and the overall survival 95% [95% CI: 90-100]. Toxicity was manageable and mainly consisted of grade 3/4 hematological toxicity, fever, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity (grade 1/2) and transiently elevated liver enzymes during BV-DHAP. Eighteen patients developed new onset peripheral neuropathy (maximum grade 1/2) and all recovered. In conclusion, BV-DHAP is a very effective salvage regimen in R/R cHL patients, but patients should be monitored closely for toxicity. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02280993."

Total 134 cesarean delivery women with PE were randomly divided into intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). Both groups underwent combined spinal and epidural anesthesia (CSEA), the IG was treated with 0.4 μg/(kg·min) dexmedetomidine for 10 min before surgery. The CG was treated with equivalent saline. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the two groups were measured at different time point after administration. Level of inflammatory factors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Visual analogue score (VAS), Ramsay sedation score (RSS), and kidney injury related indexes were evaluated at different time points. The plasma-drug concentration of patients was determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method. Compared with CG, HR, PE, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) showed lower level while SpO2 showed higher level in IG. Furthermore, expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10 in IG was decreased after drug administration, the contents of β2-MG, KIM-1 and urine protein were also decreased in contrast to the CG (all P<0.05). Besides, VAS score was decreased but Ramsay score was increased in the IG (both P<0.05). The results of HPLC showed that the half life of dexmedetomidine was about 20 min and it is speculated that the drug can be quickly metabolized within 24 h. Dexmedetomidine exerted protective effects on kidney injury of parturients with PE undergoing cesarean section."

Efficacy and safety of citrate-based anticoagulation compared to heparin in patients with acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy: a randomized controlled trial.,"Fabien Stucker, Belen Ponte, James Tataw, Pierre-Yves Martin, Hannah Wozniak, Jérome Pugin, Patrick Saudan, Fabien Stuckeret al.",2015 Mar 18,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25881975/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      A systemic anticoagulation is often required to prevent circuit and filter clotting in ICU patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). A regional citrate-based anticoagulation (RCA) does not induce a systemic anticoagulation and prolongs the filter lifespan, but metabolic side-effects have been associated with this therapy. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with patients requiring CRRT to determine whether RCA using a balanced predilution replacement fluid is more effective than heparin in terms of renal replacement delivered dose and safety profile.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred and three patients with AKI requiring CRRT were included. The patients were randomized to either CRRT with RCA or heparin anticoagulation. Primary endpoints were effective daily delivered RRT dose during the first 3 days of CRRT and filter lifespan. Secondary endpoints were 28-day and 90-day survival and severe metabolic complications and bleeding disorders.

      Median CRRT duration was 3.0 (2-6) days. Effective delivered daily RRT doses were 29 ± 3 and 27 ± 5 mL/kg/hr in the RCA and heparin groups, respectively (p = 0.005). Filter lifespans were 49 ± 29 versus 28 ± 23 hrs in the RCA and heparin groups (p = 0.004). Survival rates at 28 and 90 days were 80-74% in the RCA and 74-73% in the heparin group. Electrolytes and acid-base disturbances were uncommon and transient in patients treated with RCA.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results show that RCA is superior to heparin-based anticoagulation in terms of delivered RRT dose and filter life span and is a safe and feasible method. This does not translate into an improvement in short term survival.

Rilpivirine use in the Swiss HIV cohort study: a prospective cohort study.,"Delphine Sculier, Angèle Gayet-Ageron, Manuel Battegay, Matthias Cavassini, Jan Fehr, Cedric Hirzel, Patrick Schmid, Enos Bernasconi, Alexandra Calmy                              ;, Swiss HIV Cohort Study, Delphine Sculieret al.",2017 Jul 6,BMC Infect Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28683720/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Rilpivirine is safe and effective in HIV-naïve patients with low baseline HIV-RNA or in switch strategy. It offers the advantages of few drug-drug interactions and a favourable toxicity profile. We aimed to determine the reasons for prescribing the rilpivirine (RPV)/tenofovir disoproxil (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) co-formulation within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and to assess its effectiveness and safety over a 24 months period.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All individuals enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study who initiated a RPV/TDF/FTC co-formulation between April 2013 and March 2014 were included. Primary outcomes were the HIV-RNA viral load (copies/mL) and CD4 cell count (cells/mm3) at 6, 12 and 24 months. Reasons for a switch to RPV/TDF/FTC were evaluated through a standardized questionnaire. We also assessed discontinuation and reasons for discontinuation of RPV/TDF/FTC until October 30, 2015.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 644 individuals who started the RPV/TDF/FTC co-formulation, only 7.5% were treatment-naïve. At 24 months, viral suppression (HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL) was achieved in 100% and 96.7% of cART-naïve and cART-experienced patients respectively. The switch to RPV was mainly done for simplification (44.6%) and to overcome central nervous system toxicity symptoms due to efavirenz (24%). Six months after switch, 74.8% of patients reported an improvement of psycho-neurological symptoms with continued improvement at 12 months for almost 80%. However, one quarter of patients reported a discontinuation of RPV/TDF/FTC on October 30, 2015 after a median time of 18.4 months. Reasons for discontinuation included physician decision (5.3%) and side-effects (3.9%) mainly related to the central nervous system and to renal toxicity.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The RPV/TDF/FTC co-formulation was safe and effective throughout 24 months of follow-up but barely prescribed for HIV-naïve patients. Despite excellent virological suppression among both treatment-naïve and -experienced patients, we observed a high rate of treatment discontinuation."
Concurrent Chemoradiation with Weekly Cisplatin for the Treatment of Head and Neck Cancers: an Institutional Study on Acute Toxicity and Response to Treatment.,"Saptarshi Ghosh, Pamidimukkala Brahmananda Rao, P Ravindra Kumar, Surendra Manam, Saptarshi Ghoshet al.",2015,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26514533/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Concurrent chemoradiation with three weekly high dose cisplatin is the non-surgical standard of care for the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancers. Although this treatment regime is efficacious, it has high acute toxicity, which leads not only to increased treatment cost, but also to increased overall treatment time. Hence, the current study was undertaken to evaluate the acute toxicity and tumor response in head and neck cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 40 mg/m2 weekly cisplatin, which has been our institutional practice.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This single institution retrospective study included data for 287 head and neck cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation from 2012 to 2014.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean age of the patients was 48.8 years. The most common site of involvement was oral cavity. Most of the study patients presented with advanced stage disease. The mean overall treatment time was 56.9 days. Some 67.2% had overall complete response to treatment as documented till 90 days from the start of treatment. According to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria, mucositis was seen in 95.1% of the patients. Dermatitis and emesis were observed in 81.9% and 98.6%, respectively. Regarding haematological toxicity, 48.8% and 29.6% suffered from anaemia and leukopenia, respectively, during treatment. Acute kidney injury was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), and was found in 18.8% of the patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin is an effective treatment regime for head and neck cancers with reasonable toxicity which can be used in developing countries, where cost of treatment is so important."
Acute kidney injury observed during phase 1 clinical trials of a novel xanthine oxidase/URAT1 dual inhibitor PF-06743649.,"Pinky Dua, Rachel Gurrell, Simon Kirby, Maria Sudworth, Peter T Loudon, Pinky Duaet al.",2016 Aug,Clin Rheumatol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27094945/,"Acute kidney injury, Gout, URAT1, Xanthine oxidase.","The objective of these clinical studies was to assess the safety and urate lowering activity of a novel urate transporter 1 (URAT1)/ xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor PF-06743649 in healthy subjects and gout patients. Escalating doses of PF-06743649 or placebo were given to healthy young subjects, healthy elderly subjects and gout patients. Serum uric acid (sUA) and urinary pharmacodynamic markers were assayed, and safety was assessed by collection of adverse events and assessment of safety labs, ECGs and vital signs. Administration of PF-06743649 led to rapid decrease in sUA in all cohorts; in gout patients, a change from baseline of 69 % was observed for the 40 mg dose. Urinary and serum biomarkers were consistent with inhibition of both URAT1 and XO. Although dosing was otherwise well tolerated, two subjects experienced serious adverse events of acute kidney injury. Both subjects exhibited increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen in the first 3 days post first dose and were hospitalised. One subject exhibited oliguria for the first 24 h. Both subjects made a complete recovery with minimal intervention. PF-06743649 was effective at rapidly lowering sUA, but further development was terminated for an identified renal safety risk."

      In a Phase 3 international clinical trial (VIALE-C), venetoclax plus low-dose cytarabine improved the response rate and overall survival versus placebo plus low-dose cytarabine in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. After the enrollment period of VIALE-C ended, we conducted an expanded access study to provide preapproval access to venetoclax in combination with low-dose cytarabine in Japan.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Previously, untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy were enrolled according to the VIALE-C criteria. Patients received venetoclax (600 mg, Days 1-28, 4-day ramp-up in Cycle 1) in 28-day cycles and low-dose cytarabine (20 mg/m2, Days 1-10). All patients took tumor lysis syndrome prophylactic agents and hydration. Safety endpoints were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fourteen patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 77.5 years (range = 61-84), with 78.6% over 75 years old. The most common grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse event was neutropenia (57.1%). Febrile neutropenia was the most frequent serious adverse event (21.4%). One patient developed treatment-related acute kidney injury, leading to discontinuation of treatment. Two patients died because of cardiac failure and disease progression that were judged not related to study treatment. No patients developed tumor lysis syndrome.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The safety outcomes were similar to those in VIALE-C without new safety signals and were well managed with standard medical care. In clinical practice, more patients with severe background disease are expected, in comparison with in VIALE-C, suggesting that it is important to carefully manage and prevent adverse events."
Comparison of Intravenous and Oral Hydration in the Prevention of Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Low-Risk Patients: A Randomized Trial.,"Paloma L Martin-Moreno, Nerea Varo, Eduardo Martínez-Ansó, Nerea Martin-Calvo, Carmen Sayón-Orea, Jose I Bilbao, Nuria Garcia-Fernandez, Paloma L Martin-Morenoet al.",2015,Nephron,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26336919/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a common cause of renal failure. We evaluated the effectiveness of oral sodium citrate versus intravenous (IV) sodium bicarbonate for CI-AKI prophylaxis as well as their influence on kidney injury biomarkers.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      A randomized, controlled, single-center study including 130 hospitalized patients (62.3% men), who were randomized to receive sodium bicarbonate (1/6 men, 3 ml/kg/h for 1 h; n = 43), oral sodium citrate (75 ml/10 kg divided into 4 doses; n = 43) or nonspecific hydration (n = 44) before contrast administration, was conducted. Serum creatinine and kidney injury biomarkers (cystatin C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, interleukin-8, F2-isoprostanes and cardiotrophin-1 [CT-1]) were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Incidence of CI-AKI was 9.2% with no differences found between hydration groups: 7.0% in sodium bicarbonate group, 11.6% in oral sodium citrate group and 9.1% in the nonspecific hydration group. Urinary creatinine and urinary CT-1/creatinine ratio decreased 4 h after contrast infusion (p < 0.001), but none of the biomarkers assessed were affected by the treatments.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There were no differences in hydration with oral sodium citrate and IV sodium bicarbonate for the prophylaxis of CI-AKI. Therefore, oral hydration represents a safe, inexpensive and practical method for preventing CI-AKI in low-risk patients. No effect on biomarkers for kidney injury could be demonstrated."
Lack of difference in acute nephrotoxicity of intravenous bisphosphonates zoledronic acid and ibandronate in women with breast cancer and bone metastases.,"Dörte W Luedders, Jürgen Steinhoff, Marc Thill, Achim Rody, Michael K Bohlmann, Dörte W Luedderset al.",2015 Mar,Anticancer Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25750345/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      More than 50% of patients with advanced breast cancer develop bone metastases that may lead to multiple complications such as pathological fractures, bone pain or hypercalcaemia. The standard treatment, besides endocrine, targeted-therapy or chemotherapy, is the use of bisphosphonates. However, one of their main adverse side-effects is bisphosphonate-induced nephrotoxicity. The mechanism by which the latter occurs is not well-understood, although emerging evidence suggests that the effect of bisphosphonates on the kidney may differ between agents.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      The aim of this evaluation was to compare the renal toxicity of 6 mg ibandronate i.v. versus 4 mg zoledronic acid i.v. over a period of six months in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. A prospective randomized trial was carried out to examine specific kidney and other parameters (α1- and β2-microglobulin, albumin, α2-macroglobulin, IgG and C-reactive protein (CRP) generated from spontaneous urine samples from 17 patients of each group.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We were unable to find any significant difference between the two treatment groups with regard to renal toxicity. All patients, independently of the applied bisphosphonate, experienced only temporary renal dysfunction without any evidence of irreversible damage in terms of acute nephrotoxicity during the study period. α1-Microglobulin, a marker for proximal tubular damage, in particular, was not differently elevated in either group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Both applied bisphosphonates were found to be well-tolerated and safe with regard to renal toxicity during a six-month treatment period in patients with otherwise healthy kidneys having advanced breast cancer and bone metastases."
A LC/MS/MS method for determination of tenofovir in human plasma and its application to toxicity monitoring.,"Narit Wiriyakosol, Apichaya Puangpetch, Weerawut Manosuthi, Sasinapha Tomongkon, Chonlaphat Sukasem, Darawan Pinthong, Narit Wiriyakosolet al.",2018 May 15:1085:89-95.,J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29635209/,"HIV-1, Kidney injury, LC/MS/MS, Tenofovir, Tenofovir plasma concentration.","Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a pro-drug of the active metabolite tenofovir widely used against the HIV1, HIV2, and Hepatitis B virus. Several studies have been conducted and found kidney injury associated with tenofovir exposure. High tenofovir plasma concentration correlated with kidney injury in tenofovir-exposed patients. The present study developed and validated a simple and cost-effective LC/MS/MS method to determine tenofovir level in human plasma. A small plasma volume of 80 μl is utilized for the sample preparation. The samples were separated by Luna C18 (100 mm × 2.0 mm, 3 μm) using gradient elution with a mobile phase consisting of water (containing 0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile (90:10, v/v). The detection was achieved through multiple reaction monitoring using positive ionization mode on the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a run time of 10 min. The monitoring transitions were set at m/z 288.0 → 176.1 and 136.1 for tenofovir and m/z 226.1 → 152.0 for acyclovir (as the internal standard). This standard curve was linear from 10 to 640 ng/ml, with the lower limit of quantification of 10 ng/ml. The inter- and intra-day precision results were less than 12.3% and their accuracies were within the acceptable range of 84.9-113.1%. The validated method was successfully applied to the study of tenofovir induced kidney injury in HIV-1 infected patients taking 300 mg once daily for more than 4 weeks."
Heparin-Binding Protein (HBP): A Causative Marker and Potential Target for Heparin Treatment of Human Sepsis-Induced Acute Kidney Injury.,"Jane Fisher, James A Russell, Peter Bentzer, Devyn Parsons, Stefano Secchia, Matthias Mörgelin, Keith R Walley, John H Boyd, Adam Linder, Jane Fisheret al.",2017 Sep,Shock,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28319494/,No keywords found,"Rationale:
        
      
      Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition with high morbidity and mortality. Neutrophil-derived heparin-binding protein (HBP) induces vascular leakage and is a promising biomarker of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. It remains unknown if HBP is prognostic of AKI in septic shock and if HBP could play a role in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced AKI.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To determine the association of plasma HBP levels with development of AKI, investigate the role of HBP in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced AKI, and test the effect of blocking HBP using heparin derivatives.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In 296 septic shock patients from the randomized multicenter Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST) plasma HBP levels were associated with development of AKI and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Human renal tubular cells were exposed to recombinant HBP to evaluate inflammation and heparin derivatives were used to abrogate these effects. Finally, mice were exposed to HBP with and without heparin derivatives and the kidneys examined for signs of inflammation.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Plasma HBP levels were significantly higher in patients with AKI and those requiring RRT. HBP levels identified patients with moderate AKI with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.85. HBP increased IL-6 production in renal tubular epithelial cells. Different heparin derivatives abrogated the HBP-induced increased inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Elevated plasma HBP is associated with development of sepsis-induced AKI and HBP is involved in its pathophysiology. Our studies suggest that heparin(s) could be tested for efficacy and safety of prevention of sepsis-induced AKI."

      Children, adolescents, and young adults with very high-risk (VHR) B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have poor outcomes, and novel therapies are needed for this subgroup. The AALL1131 study evaluated postinduction therapy using cyclophosphamide (CPM), etoposide (ETOP), and clofarabine (CLOF) for patients with VHR B-ALL.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients who were 1 to 30 years old and had VHR B-ALL received modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster therapy after induction and were randomized to 1) CPM, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, vincristine (VCR), and pegaspargase (control arm), 2) CPM, ETOP, VCR, and pegaspargase (experimental arm 1), or 3) CPM, ETOP, CLOF (30 mg/m2 /d × 5), VCR, and pegaspargase (experimental arm 2) during the second half of consolidation and delayed intensification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The rates of grade 4/5 infections and grade 3/4 pancreatitis were significantly increased in experimental arm 2. The dose of CLOF was, therefore, reduced to 20 mg/m2 /d × 5, and myeloid growth factor was required after CLOF administration. Despite these changes, 4 of 39 patients (10.3%) developed grade 4 infections, with 1 of these patients developing a grade 5 acute kidney injury attributed to CLOF, whereas only 1 of 46 patients (2.2%) in experimental arm 1 developed grade 4 infections, and there were no grade 4/5 infections in the control arm (n = 20). Four patients in experimental arm 2 had prolonged cytopenias for >60 days, whereas none did in the control arm or experimental arm 1. Counts failed to recover for 2 of these patients, one having a grade 5 acute kidney injury and the other removed from protocol therapy; both events occurred 92 days after the start of consolidation part 2.

      In AALL1131, CLOF, administered with CPM and ETOP, was associated with unacceptable toxicity. Cancer 2018;124:1150-9. © 2017 American Cancer Society."
Sodium bicarbonate infusion in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation: a single center randomized controlled pilot trial.,"Laurence Weinberg, Jeremy Broad, Param Pillai, Guangjun Chen, Micheline Nguyen, Glenn M Eastwood, Nick Scurrah, Mehrdad Nikfarjam, David Story, Larry McNicol, Rinaldo Bellomo, Laurence Weinberget al.",2016 May,Clin Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26915026/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Liver transplantation-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) carries significant morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that sodium bicarbonate would reduce the incidence and/or severity of liver transplantation-associated AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this double-blinded pilot RCT, adult patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation were randomized to an infusion of either 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (0.5 mEq/kg/h for the first hour; 0.15 mEq/kg/h until completion of surgery); (n = 30) or 0.9% sodium chloride (n = 30).
    


          Primary outcome:
        
      
      AKI within the first 48 h post-operatively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups with regard to baseline characteristics, model for end-stage liver disease and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores, and pre-transplantation renal function. Intra-operative factors were similar for duration of surgery, blood product requirements, crystalloid and colloid volumes infused and requirements for vasoactive therapy. Eleven patients (37%) in the bicarbonate group and 10 patients (33%) in the sodium chloride group developed a post-operative AKI (p = 0.79). Bicarbonate infusion attenuated the degree of immediate post-operative metabolic acidosis; however, this effect dissipated by 48 h. There were no significant differences in ventilation hours, ICU or hospital length of stay, or mortality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The intra-operative infusion of sodium bicarbonate did not decrease the incidence of AKI in patients following orthotopic liver transplantation."

      In clinical practice, colistin is used as combination therapy to improve its antibacterial activity, despite the consequent increase in toxicity. This prospective, comparative study evaluated the effectiveness and adverse effects of using colistin alone at a loading dose of 9 million international units (MIU) followed by 3 MIU every 8h (q8h) versus colistin+meropenem 1g q8h in treating multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. The secondary measure was the occurrence of colistin toxicity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 60 patients were divided into two groups (30 patients each); the first group received intravenous colistin at a mean daily dose of 8.304 MIU and the second group received colistin 8.58 MIU combined with meropenem (mean daily dose of 2.88g for 15 days).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The colistin-meropenem combination group showed a significant decrease in mortality versus colistin alone [16.7% (5/30) vs. 43.3% (13/30); P=0.047]. The improved clinical response mediated by combination therapy was not associated with any significant nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity or neurotoxicity. Moreover, the 42 surviving patients showed normal procalcitonin values associated with a decrease in SOFA score, whilst 12 of them showed significantly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (P=0.0002).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study revealed the superiority of colistin-meropenem combination therapy over colistin monotherapy in the treatment of MDR K. pneumoniae-induced HAP or VAP and highlights the advantage of procalcitonin over CRP as a marker for eradication of sepsis and suspension of therapy."
Goal-directed versus Standard Fluid Therapy to Decrease Ileus after Open Radical Cystectomy: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Vittoria Arslan-Carlon, Kay See Tan, Guido Dalbagni, Alessia C Pedoto, Harry W Herr, Bernard H Bochner, Eugene K Cha, Timothy F Donahue, Mary Fischer, S Machele Donat, Vittoria Arslan-Carlonet al.",2020 Aug,Anesthesiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32472804/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Postoperative ileus is a common complication of intraabdominal surgeries, including radical cystectomy with reported rates as high as 32%. Perioperative fluid administration has been associated with improvement in postoperative ileus rates, but it is difficult to generalize because earlier studies lacked standardized definitions of postoperative ileus and other relevant outcomes. The hypothesis was that targeted individualized perioperative fluid management would improve postoperative ileus in patients receiving radical cystectomy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a parallel-arm, double-blinded, single-center randomized trial of goal-directed fluid therapy versus standard fluid therapy for patients undergoing open radical cystectomy. The primary outcome was postoperative ileus, and the secondary outcome was complications within 30 days post-surgery. Participants were at least 21 yr old, had a maximum body mass index of 45 kg/m and no active atrial fibrillation. The intervention in the goal-directed therapy arm combined preoperative and postoperative stroke volume optimization and intraoperative stroke volume variation minimization to guide fluid administration, using advanced hemodynamic monitoring.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Between August 2014 and April 2018, 283 radical cystectomy patients (142 goal-directed fluid therapy and 141 standard fluid therapy) were included in the analysis. Postoperative ileus occurred in 25% (36 of 142) of patients in the goal-directed fluid therapy arm and 21% (30 of 141) of patients in the standard arm (difference in proportions, 4.1%; 95% CI, -5.8 to 13.9; P = 0.418). There was no difference in incidence of high-grade complications between the two arms (20 of 142 [14%] vs. 23 of 141 [16%]; difference in proportions, -2.2%; 95% CI, -10.6 to 6.1; P = 0.602), with the exception of acute kidney injury, which was more frequent in the goal-directed fluid therapy arm (56% [80 of 142] vs. 40% [56 of 141] in the standard arm; difference in proportions, 16.6%; 95% CI, 5.1 to 28.1; P = 0.005; P = 0.170 after adjustment for multiple testing).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Goal-directed fluid therapy may not be an effective strategy for lowering the risk of postoperative ileus in patients undergoing open radical cystectomy."
Treatment with carvedilol improves survival of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure: a randomized controlled trial.,"Manoj Kumar, Sumit Kainth, Ashok Choudhury, Rakhi Maiwall, Lalita G Mitra, Vandana Saluja, Prashant Mohan Agarwal, Saggere Muralikrishna Shasthry, Ankur Jindal, Ankit Bhardwaj, Guresh Kumar, Shiv K Sarin, Manoj Kumaret al.",2019 Nov,Hepatol Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541422/,No keywords found,"Background and aims:
        
      
      In addition to the portal pressure reducing effect, non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) have possible immunomodulatory and effect in reducing bacterial translocation. Recently, it has been shown that patients who are already on NSBBs should be continued on them (if feasible), if acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) develops. It, however, remains unknown if patients with ACLF and no or small esophageal varices at presentation will benefit from the use of NSBBs. We studied the efficacy and safety of carvedilol in patients with ACLF in reducing mortality, variceal bleeding and non-bleeding complications.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      136 patients with ACLF (with no or small esophageal varices and HVPG ≥ 12 mmHg) were randomized to either carvedilol (n = 66) or placebo arms (n = 70).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Within 28 days, 7 (10.6%) of 66 patients in the carvedilol group and 17 (24.3%) of 70 in the placebo group died (p= 0.044). Fewer patients in the carvedilol compared to placebo group developed acute kidney injury (AKI) (13.6% vs 35.7%, p = 0.003 and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (6.1% vs 21.4%, p= 0.013). Significantly, more patients in the placebo group had increase in APASL ACLF Research Consortium-ACLF grade (22.9% vs 6.1%, p= 0.007). There was no significant difference in the 90-day transplant-free survival rate and development of AKI, SBP, non-SBP infections (including pneumonia) and variceal bleed within 90 days, between the two groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In ACLF patients with either no or small esophageal varices and HVPG ≥ 12 mmHg, carvedilol leads to improved survival and fewer AKI and SBP events up to 28 days. CLINICALTRIALS.

          Methods:
        
      
      Serum biochemistry and clinical tolerance were compared during CVVHDF treatments with an electrolyte-enriched (Phoxilium) or standard solutions in 10 acute renal failure patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      As compared to standard fluids, serum potassium and phosphate levels were maintained in the normal range with Phoxilium without any supplementation but total serum calcium levels were significantly lower. Bicarbonatemia was slightly higher (24-26 vs. 21.5-24.5 mmol/l, p < 0.05) with conventional solutions and was associated with a significant increased level of pH (>7.44). Despite the absence of glucose in the Phoxilium solution, blood glucose levels and glucose supplementation were similar between treatments. Clinical tolerance and efficiency of CVVHDF sessions were comparable.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Phoxilium effectively prevented hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia during CVVHDF. It was, however, associated with a slight metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia compared with conventional solutions."
"The Effect of Intravenous Mannitol Combined With Normal Saline in Preventing Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","Panot Sainamthip, Siriwimon Saichaemchan, Bancha Satirapoj, Naiyarat Prasongsook, Panot Sainamthipet al.",2022 Mar:8:e2100275.,JCO Glob Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35436142/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Nephrotoxicity is a major dose-limiting toxicity among patients with cancer who were treated with cisplatin. Although no standard approach is available to prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, administering intravenous isotonic saline is recommended. Additionally, mannitol combined with hydration has been evaluated, but none of them have been established. Our study aimed to determine the efficacy of mannitol combined hydration to prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      This study was a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled design. All patients with solid cancers who were treated with cisplatin (n = 48) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 25) or 20 g of mannitol (n = 23) after completing 2 L of prehydration and receiving cisplatin. Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, electrolyte, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured at baseline and days 2 and 7. Moreover, GFR was calculated based on the 24-hour urine creatinine clearance rate to assess renal function at baseline and 48 hours after receiving cisplatin. Severity of nausea and vomiting was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No difference was found regarding baseline characteristics between the two groups. Seven of 23 patients (37.4%) in the mannitol group and 10 of 25 patients (40%) in the placebo group increased serum creatinine level ≥ 0.3 mg/dL at 48 hours after intervention (P value = .48). Patients receiving mannitol exhibited significantly lower incidence of 24-hour urine GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m than those in the placebo group (13.6% v 48.0% in the placebo group; P value = .012). Univariate analysis showed the greatest benefit for administering mannitol among patients receiving cisplatin > 80 mg/m2, or patients receiving concomitant radiation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Mannitol combined with hydration significantly prevented cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Additionally, mannitol should be particularly considered among patients with cancer, treated with cisplatin > 80 mg/m2, or patients receiving concomitant radiation."
eGFR decrease during antiviral C therapy with first generation protease inhibitors: a clinical significance?,"Véronique Loustaud-Ratti, Annick Rousseau, Paul Carrier, Chanlina Vong, Tristan Chambaraud, Jérémie Jacques, Marilyne Debette-Gratien, Denis Sautereau, Marie Essig, Véronique Loustaud-Rattiet al.",2015 Jan,Liver Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25039814/,No keywords found,"Background & aims:
        
      
      Renal toxicity of first generation protease inhibitors (PIs) was not a safety signal in phase III clinical trials, but was recently reported in recent studies. It appeared important to determine the clinical significance of these findings.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively analysed 101 HCV patients receiving triple therapy with telaprevir (n = 36) or boceprevir (n = 26) or double therapy (n = 39) with peginterferon and ribavirin and having a close monitoring of eGFR (MDRD formula) during and after treatment. EGFR decline over time was assessed by a linear mixed-effects model (LMEM) with search for possible explanatory covariates.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients treated with telaprevir presented a significant decrease of eGFR with the same kinetics: initial decrease at W (week) 4, nadir at W8 (mean decrease 17.0 ± 18.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and return to baseline at W16. The W8 eGFR was correlated with the D0 eGFR (R(2) = 0.49). The LMEM showed that interindividual variability in the slope of eGFR vs time between D0 and W8 was non-significant and eGFR nadir could be predicted from eGFR obtained at D0. In multivariate analysis, eGFR intercept (i.e. baseline value) was associated with older age and male sex.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The eGFR significantly varied in telaprevir group only. Our model showed that eGFR nadir mainly depended on initial eGFR. As telaprevir has been shown to inhibit mostly the drug transporter OCT2 which interacts with creatinine transport, the early decrease of eGFR observed could be a benign phenomenon. However, as unpredictable true renal toxicity may occur during therapy, we recommend a thorough follow-up of eGFR."
Intermittent furosemide administration in patients with or at risk for acute kidney injury: Meta-analysis of randomized trials.,"Tiziana Bove, Alessandro Belletti, Alessandro Putzu, Simone Pappacena, Giuseppe Denaro, Giovanni Landoni, Sean M Bagshaw, Alberto Zangrillo, Tiziana Boveet al.",2018 Apr 24,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29689116/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Furosemide is the most common loop diuretic used worldwide. The off-label administration of furosemide bolus(es) for the prevention or to reverse acute kidney injury (AKI) is widespread but not supported by available evidence. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials (RCTs) to investigate whether bolus furosemide to prevent or treat AKI is detrimental on patients' survival.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Electronic databases were searched through October 2017 for RCTs comparing bolus furosemide administration versus any comparator in patients with or at risk for AKI. The primary endpoint was all-cause longest follow-up mortality. Secondary endpoints included new or worsening AKI, receipt of renal replacement therapy, length of hospital stay, and peak serum creatinine after randomization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 28 studies randomizing 3,228 patients were included in the analysis. We found no difference in mortality between the two groups (143/892 [16%] in the furosemide group versus 141/881 [16%] in the control group; odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.13; p = 0.25). No significant differences in secondary outcomes were found. A significant improvement in survival was found in the subgroup of patients receiving furosemide bolus(es) as a preventive measure (43/613 [7.0%] versus 67/619 [10.8%], OR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.94; p = 0.03).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intermittent furosemide administration is not associated with an increased mortality in patients with or at risk for AKI, although it may reduce mortality when used as a preventive measure. Future high-quality RCTs are needed to define the role of loop diuretics in AKI prevention and management.

Effect of a Contrast Modulation System on Contrast Media Use and the Rate of Acute Kidney Injury After Coronary Angiography.,"Roxana Mehran, Michela Faggioni, Jaya Chandrasekhar, Dominick J Angiolillo, Barry Bertolet, Robert Lee Jobe, Bassam Al-Joundi, Somjot Brar, George Dangas, Wayne Batchelor, Anand Prasad, Hitinder S Gurm, James Tumlin, Gregg W Stone, Roxana Mehranet al.",2018 Aug 27,JACC Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30139467/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of the AVERT (AVERT Clinical Trial for Contrast Media Volume Reduction and Incidence of CIN) trial was to test the efficacy of the AVERT system to reduce the contrast media volume (CMV) used during coronary angiographic procedures without impairing image quality and to prevent contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in patients at risk for CI-AKI.
    


          Background:
        
      
      CI-AKI is a common complication of percutaneous coronary procedures, associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The AVERT system alters the coronary injection pressure profile by diverting contrast away from the patient during coronary injection.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The AVERT trial was a prospective, multicenter, 1:1 randomized clinical trial in 578 subjects with either baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate 20 to 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 to 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and at least 2 additional risk factors for CI-AKI. Patients undergoing coronary angiography with planned or possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomized to hydration plus the AVERT system (n = 292) or hydration only (n = 286). The primary effectiveness endpoints were: 1) the total CMV used; and 2) the incidence of CI-AKI, defined as a ≥0.3 mg/dl increase in serum creatinine within 5 days post-procedure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patient demographics were well balanced between the groups, with mean baseline serum creatinine of 1.6 ± 0.4 mg/dl and 64.9% patients with diabetes mellitus. PCI was performed in 42.2% of procedures, with coronary angiography in the remainder. Use of AVERT resulted in a 15.5% relative reduction in CMV overall (85.6 ± 50.5 ml vs. 101.3 ± 71.1 ml; p = 0.02) and a 22.8% relative reduction in CMV among PCI patients (114 ± 55 ml vs. 147 ± 81 ml; p = 0.001). The maximum relative reduction in CMV was 46% (124 ± 48 ml vs. 232 ± 97 ml; p = 0.01) when ≥3 lesions were treated. There were no differences in the rates of CI-AKI (27.0% vs. 26.6%; p = 0.70) between the study groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Use of the AVERT system was feasible and safe, with acceptable image quality during coronary angiography and PCI. AVERT significantly reduced CMV, with the extent of CMV reduction correlating with procedural complexity. No significant differences in CI-AKI were observed with AVERT in this trial.

An innovative approach to addressing antimicrobial resistance may be pathogen-targeted development programs. Sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR) is a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic that is being developed to specifically target drug-resistant ABC. The development of SUL-DUR culminated with the Acinetobacter Treatment Trial Against Colistin (ATTACK) trial, a global, randomized, active-controlled phase 3 clinical trial that compared SUL-DUR with colistin for treating serious infections due to carbapenem-resistant ABC. SUL-DUR met the primary noninferiority endpoint of 28-day all-cause mortality. Furthermore, SUL-DUR had a favorable safety profile with a statistically significant lower incidence of nephrotoxicity compared with colistin. If approved, SUL-DUR could be an important treatment option for infections caused by ABC, including carbapenem-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains. The development program and the ATTACK trial highlight the potential for pathogen-targeted development programs to address the challenge of antimicrobial resistance."
A Randomized 2x2 Factorial Clinical Trial of Renal Transplantation: Steroid-Free Maintenance Immunosuppression with Calcineurin Inhibitor Withdrawal after Six Months Associates with Improved Renal Function and Reduced Chronic Histopathology.,"R Brian Stevens, Kirk W Foster, Clifford D Miles, Andre C Kalil, Diana F Florescu, John P Sandoz, Theodore H Rigley, Tamer Malik, Lucile E Wrenshall, R Brian Stevenset al.",2015 Oct 14,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26465152/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      The two most significant impediments to renal allograft survival are rejection and the direct nephrotoxicity of the immunosuppressant drugs required to prevent it. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), a mainstay of most immunosuppression regimens, are particularly nephrotoxic. Until less toxic antirejection agents become available, the only option is to optimize our use of those at hand.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To determine whether intensive rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) induction followed by CNI withdrawal would individually or combined improve graft function and reduce graft chronic histopathology-surrogates for graft and, therefore, patient survival. As previously reported, a single large rATG dose over 24 hours was well-tolerated and associated with better renal function, fewer infections, and improved patient survival. Here we report testing whether complete CNI discontinuation would improve renal function and decrease graft pathology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Between April 20, 2004 and 4-14-2009 we conducted a prospective, randomized, non-blinded renal transplantation trial of two rATG dosing protocols (single dose, 6 mg/kg vs. divided doses, 1.5 mg/kg every other day x 4; target enrollment = 180). Subsequent maintenance immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus, a CNI, and sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. We report here the outcome of converting patients after six months either to minimized tacrolimus/sirolimus or mycophenolate mofetil/sirolimus. Primary endpoints were graft function and chronic histopathology from protocol kidney biopsies at 12 and 24 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CNI withdrawal (on-treatment analysis) associated with better graft function (p <0.001) and lower chronic histopathology composite scores in protocol biopsies at 12 (p = 0.003) and 24 (p = 0.013) months, without affecting patient (p = 0.81) or graft (p = 0.93) survival, or rejection rate (p = 0.17).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      CNI (tacrolimus) withdrawal at six months may provide a strategy for decreased nephrotoxicity and improved long-term function in steroid-free low immunological risk renal transplant patients.

      We aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety profile of tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) using the I-neb device to the standard PARI-LC Plus nebulizer in children with cystic fibrosis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A randomized, open-label, crossover study was performed. In 2 separate study visits, blood samples from 22 children were collected following TIS nebulization with I-neb (75 mg) and PARI-LC Plus (300 mg). Study visits were separated by 1 month, in which 1 of the study nebulizers was used twice daily. Tobramycin PK for both nebulizers was established using measured tobramycin concentrations and Bayesian PK modelling software. Hearing and renal function tests were performed to test for aminoglycoside associated toxicity. In addition to standard estimated glomerular filtration rate values, biomarkers for tubular injury (KIM-1 and NAG) were measured. Patient and nebulizer satisfaction were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Inhalations were well tolerated and serum trough concentrations below the predefined toxic limit were reached with no significant differences in PK parameters between nebulizers. Results of audiometry and estimated glomerular filtration rate revealed no abnormalities. However, increased urinary NAG/creatinine ratios at visit 2 for both nebulizers suggest TIS-induced subclinical tubular kidney injury. Nebulization time was 50% shorter and patient satisfaction was significantly higher with the I-neb.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Nebulization of 75 mg TIS with the I-neb in children with cystic fibrosis resulted in comparable systemic exposure to 300 mg TIS with the PARI-LC Plus and was well tolerated and preferred over the PARI-LC Plus. Long-term safety of TIS nebulization should be monitored clinically, especially regarding the effects on tubular kidney injury."

ABK was administered intravenously at a dose of approximately 5 mg/kg with various broad-spectrum β-lactams, followed by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). A total of 54 febrile or infectious episodes were registered, and TDM was performed in 44 (81%) cases. The absolute neutrophil count was below 500/μl in 49 (91%) cases, and cytotoxic chemotherapy was being administered in 47 (87%) cases. Before initiation of ABK, 52 (96%) patients had received fluoroquinolones (n = 37) and/or broad-spectrum β-lactams (n = 34). There were 10 cases of documented infections including one of MRSA pneumonia, and 44 cases of febrile neutropenia. The efficacy at the end of treatment was 80% for all patients, and efficacy was significantly higher in patients attaining maximum concentrations ≥ 16 µg/ml or receiving TDM-guided dose-adjustment of ABK (n = 19, 95 vs. 71%, P = 0.039). Renal toxicity was observed in six cases (11%) but was generally acceptable. This study demonstrated that TDM-guided ABK administration may be applicable under limited conditions for patients with hematological malignancies."

      Hyperthermic intraoperative cisplatin (HIOC) is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). Administration of high-dose magnesium attenuates cisplatin-induced AKI (CP-AKI) in animal models but has not been rigorously examined in humans.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We tested the feasibility and safety of different doses of magnesium in mesothelioma patients receiving HIOC. In Pilot Study 1, we administered a 36-h continuous infusion of magnesium at 0.5 g/h, targeting serum magnesium levels between 3 and 4.8 mg/dL. In Pilot Study 2A, we administered a 6 g bolus followed by an infusion starting at 2 g/h, titrated to achieve levels between 4 and 6 mg/dL. We eliminated the bolus in Pilot Study 2B.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In Pilot Study 1, all five patients enrolled completed the study; however, median postoperative Mg levels were only 2.4 mg/dL. In Pilot Study 2A, two of four patients (50%) were withdrawn due to bradycardia during the bolus. In Pilot Study 2B, two patients completed the study whereas two developed postoperative bradycardia attributed to the magnesium.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A 0.5 g/h infusion for 36 h did not achieve therapeutic magnesium levels, while an infusion at 2 g/h was associated with bradycardia. These studies informed the design of a randomized clinical trial testing whether intravenously Mg attenuates HIOC-associated AKI."
EPILAT-IRA Study: A contribution to the understanding of the epidemiology of acute kidney injury in Latin America.,"Raúl Lombardi, Alejandro Ferreiro, Rolando Claure-Del Granado, Emmanuel A Burdmann, Guillermo Rosa-Diez, Luis Yu, Mauricio Younes-Ibrahim, Cristina Carlino, Jonathan S Chávez-Iñiguez, Mariana B Pereira, Carlos F Varela, Welder Zamoner, Diego Janiques, Soledad Lecueder, Víctor Cerrón-Millán, Alfonso Cueto-Manzano                              ;, EPILAT-ITA Study Group, Raúl Lombardiet al.",2019 Nov 14,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31725746/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Epidemiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) is highly dependent on patient characteristics, context and geography. Considering the limited information in Latin America and the Caribbean, we performed a study with the aim to contribute to improve its better understanding.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Observational, prospective, longitudinal, multinational cohort study addressed to determine risk factors, clinical profile, process of care and outcomes of AKI in the region. Patients meeting KDIGO AKI definition were included over a 9-month period and designated community or hospital-acquired. De-identified clinical and lab data were entered in a specifically designed on-line platform. Co-variables potentially linked to AKI onset, in-hospital and 90-days mortality, were recorded and correlated using a multiple logistic regression model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-seven physicians from 15 countries provided data on 905 patients, most with acceptable basic needs coverage. Median age 64 (50-74) yrs; most of them were male (61%) and mestizos (42%). Comorbidities were present in 77%. AKI was community-acquired in 62%. Dehydration, shock and nephrotoxic drugs were the commonest causes. During their process of care, 77% of patients were assessed by nephrologists. Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was performed in 29% of cases. In-hospital mortality was 26.5% and independently associated to older age, chronic liver disease, hypotension, shock, cardiac disturbances, hospital-acquired sepsis, KRT and mechanical ventilation. At 90-days follow up partial or complete renal recovery was 81% and mortality 24%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      AKI was mainly community-acquired, in patients with comorbidities and linked to fluid loss and nephrotoxic drugs. Mortality was high and long-term follow up poor. Notwithstanding, the study shows partially the situation in the participant countries rather than the actual epidemiology of AKI in Latin America and Caribbean, a pending and needed task."
Dose-dependent changes in renal (1)H-/(23)Na MRI after adjuvant radiochemotherapy for gastric cancer.,"Stefan Haneder, Johannes Michael Budjan, Stefan Oswald Schoenberg, Simon Konstandin, Lothar Rudi Schad, Ralf Dieter Hofheinz, Veronika Gramlich, Frederik Wenz, Frank Lohr, Judit Boda-Heggemann, Stefan Hanederet al.",2015 Apr,Strahlenther Onkol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25445156/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) for gastric cancer with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to the upper left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) allows kidney sparing despite improved target coverage. Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11×IG-IMRT; 1×3D-CRT; 1× ""positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses ≥ 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment."
Impact of pre-hydration duration on high-dose methotrexate induced nephrotoxicity in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in resource constraint centers: a randomized crossover study.,"Sanjeev Khera, Deepti Mahajan, Kapil Barbind, Sandeep Dhingra, Sanjeev Kheraet al.",2023 Apr,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36951972/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Hydration before starting high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) ensures good renal perfusion and alkaline urinary pH. The duration of pre-hydration is not uniform across protocols. We compared 6-h versus 12-h of pre-hydration for HD-MTX therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) at our centre where serial MTX level monitoring is not feasible.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This randomised cross-over study consecutively enrolled children < 12 years with ALL receiving HD-MTX. Children with pre-existing renal disease or those exposed to nephrotoxic drugs were excluded. Two groups receiving 6-h versus 12-h pre-hydration on alternate basis in same patient (each exposed to four cycles of 2-5 g/m2 of HD-MTX) were compared for HD-MTX induced nephrotoxicity (primary outcome) and other HD-MTX toxicities (HMT) as per common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE-4.0). HD-MTX was administered over 24 h as per BFM-protocol-2009. Solitary MTX levels at 36-h (MTX36) were outsourced and leucovorin (LV) was started at 36 h at 15 mg/m2/dose for 6-8 doses 6-hourly depending on MTX36. Hydration fluid was dextrose normal saline with sodium-bicarbonate and administered till last LV dose.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Total 136 HD-MTX cycles in 34 patients (age range 5-144 months) were evaluated. Nephrotoxicity [2/68 (2.9%) in 6-h versus 1/68 (1.5%) in 12-h] and HMT incidence was comparable in two pre-hydration groups. Median MTX36 levels were not affected by duration of hydration irrespective of administered dose of HD-MTX. Median serum creatinine at baseline, post-pre-hydration and at 36-h post start of HD-MTX were comparable.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Reduction of pre-hydration duration does not affect HD-MTX induced nephrotoxicity and MTX36 levels in children < 12 years."

      Guidelines advocate the treatment of HCV in all HIV/HCV co-infected individuals. The aim of this randomized, open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02707601; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02707601) was to evaluate the safety/efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) co-administered with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) or rilpivirine/F/TAF (R/F/TAF) in HIV-1/HCV co-infected participants.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL and chronic HCV-genotype (GT) 1 (HCV treatment-naïve ± compensated cirrhosis or HCV treatment-experienced non-cirrhotic) were randomized 1:1 to switch to E/C/F/TAF or R/F/TAF. If HIV suppression was maintained at Week 8, participants received 12 weeks of LDV/SOF. The primary endpoint was sustained HCV virologic response 12 weeks after LDV/SOF completion (SVR12).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 150 participants, 148 received ≥1 dose of HIV study drug and 144 received LDV/SOF (72 in each F/TAF group; 83% GT1a, 94% HCV treatment-naïve, 12% cirrhotic). Overall, SVR12 was 97% (95% confidence interval: 93-99%). Black race did not affect SVR12. Of four participants not achieving SVR12, one had HCV relapse, one had HCV virologic non-response due to non-adherence, and two missed the post-HCV Week 12 visit. Of 148 participants, 96% receiving E/C/F/TAF and 95% receiving R/F/TAF maintained HIV suppression at Week 24; no HIV resistance was detected. No participant discontinued LDV/SOF or E/C/F/TAF due to adverse events; one participant discontinued R/F/TAF due to worsening of pre-existing hypercholesterolemia. Renal toxicity was not observed in either F/TAF regimen during LDV/SOF co-administration. In conclusion, high rates of HCV SVR12 and maintenance of HIV suppression were achieved with LDV/SOF and F/TAF-based regimens.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study supports LDV/SOF co-administered with an F/TAF-based regimen in HIV-1/HCV-GT1 co-infected patients."
The pharmacokinetics and toxicity of morning vs. evening tobramycin dosing for pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis: A randomised comparison.,"A P Prayle, K Jain, D J Touw, B C P Koch, A J Knox, A Watson, A R Smyth, A P Prayleet al.",2016 Jul,J Cyst Fibros,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26282839/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Circadian variation in renal toxicity of aminoglycosides has been demonstrated in animal and human studies. People with CF are frequently prescribed aminoglycosides. Altered pharmacokinetics of aminoglycosides are predictive of toxicity.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To investigate whether the time of day of aminoglycoside administration modulates renal excretion of tobramycin and toxicity in children with CF. To determine whether circadian rhythms are disrupted in children with CF during hospital admission.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Children (age 5-18years) with CF scheduled for tobramycin therapy were randomly allocated to receive tobramycin at 0800 or 2000h. Serum tobramycin levels were drawn at 1h and between 3.5 and 5h post-infusion between days 5 and 9 of therapy. Melatonin levels were measured serially at intervals from 1800h in the evening until 1200h on the next day. Circadian rhythm was categorised as normal when dim light melatonin onset was demonstrated between 1800 and 2200h and/or peak melatonin levels were observed during the night. Weight and spirometry were measured at the start and end of the therapy. Urinary biomarkers of kidney toxicity (KIM1, NAG, NGAL, IL-18 and CysC) were assayed at the start and end of the course of tobramycin.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eighteen children were recruited to the study. There were no differences in renal clearance between the morning and evening groups. The increase in urinary KIM-1 was greater in the evening dosage group compared to the morning group (mean difference, 0.73ng/mg; 95% CI, 0.14 to 1.32; p=0.018). There were no differences in the other urinary biomarkers. There was normal circadian rhythm in 7/11 participants (64%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Renal elimination of tobramycin was not affected by the time of day of administration. Urinary KIM-1 raises the possibility of greater nephrotoxicity with evening administration. Four children showed disturbed circadian rhythm and high melatonin levels (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01207245)."
Effect of sodium bicarbonate supplementation on the renin-angiotensin system in patients with chronic kidney disease and acidosis: a randomized clinical trial.,"Dominique M Bovée, Lodi C W Roksnoer, Cornelis van Kooten, Joris I Rotmans, Liffert Vogt, Martin H de Borst, Robert Zietse, A H Jan Danser, Ewout J Hoorn, Dominique M Bovéeet al.",2021 Oct,J Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33382448/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acidosis-induced kidney injury is mediated by the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system, for which urinary renin is a potential marker. Therefore, we hypothesized that sodium bicarbonate supplementation reduces urinary renin excretion in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic acidosis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with CKD stage G4 and plasma bicarbonate 15-24 mmol/l were randomized to receive sodium bicarbonate (3 × 1000 mg/day, ~ 0.5 mEq/kg), sodium chloride (2 × 1,00 mg/day), or no treatment for 4 weeks (n = 15/arm). The effects on urinary renin excretion (primary outcome), other plasma and urine parameters of the renin-angiotensin system, endothelin-1, and proteinuria were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-five patients were included (62 ± 15 years, eGFR 21 ± 5 ml/min/1.73m2, plasma bicarbonate 21.7 ± 3.3 mmol/l). Sodium bicarbonate supplementation increased plasma bicarbonate (20.8 to 23.8 mmol/l) and reduced urinary ammonium excretion (15 to 8 mmol/day, both P < 0.05). Furthermore, a trend towards lower plasma aldosterone (291 to 204 ng/L, P = 0.07) and potassium (5.1 to 4.8 mmol/l, P = 0.06) was observed in patients receiving sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate did not significantly change the urinary excretion of renin, angiotensinogen, aldosterone, endothelin-1, albumin, or α1-microglobulin. Sodium chloride supplementation reduced plasma renin (166 to 122 ng/L), and increased the urinary excretions of angiotensinogen, albumin, and α1-microglobulin (all P < 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite correction of acidosis and reduction in urinary ammonium excretion, sodium bicarbonate supplementation did not improve urinary markers of the renin-angiotensin system, endothelin-1, or proteinuria. Possible explanations include bicarbonate dose, short treatment time, or the inability of urinary renin to reflect intrarenal renin-angiotensin system activity."
In-line filtration of intravenous infusion may reduce organ dysfunction of adult critical patients.,"Elke Schmitt, Patrick Meybohm, Eva Herrmann, Karin Ammersbach, Raphaela Endres, Simone Lindau, Philipp Helmer, Kai Zacharowski, Holger Neb, Elke Schmittet al.",2019 Nov 22,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31757216/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The potential harmful effects of particle-contaminated infusions for critically ill adult patients are yet unclear. So far, only significant improved outcome in critically ill children and new-borns was demonstrated when using in-line filters, but for adult patients, evidence is still missing.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This single-centre, retrospective controlled cohort study assessed the effect of in-line filtration of intravenous fluids with finer 0.2 or 1.2 μm vs 5.0 μm filters in critically ill adult patients. From a total of n = 3215 adult patients, n = 3012 patients were selected by propensity score matching (adjusting for sex, age, and surgery group) and assigned to either a fine filter cohort (with 0.2/1.2 μm filters, n = 1506, time period from February 2013 to January 2014) or a control filter cohort (with 5.0 μm filters, n = 1506, time period from April 2014 to March 2015). The cohorts were compared regarding the occurrence of severe vasoplegia, organ dysfunctions (lung, kidney, and brain), inflammation, in-hospital complications (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, pneumonia, and sepsis), in-hospital mortality, and length of ICU and hospital stay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Comparing fine filter vs control filter cohort, respiratory dysfunction (Horowitz index 206 (119-290) vs 191 (104.75-280); P = 0.04), pneumonia (11.4% vs 14.4%; P = 0.02), sepsis (9.6% vs 12.2%; P = 0.03), interleukin-6 (471.5 (258.8-1062.8) ng/l vs 540.5 (284.5-1147.5) ng/l; P = 0.01), and length of ICU (1.2 (0.6-4.9) vs 1.7 (0.8-6.9) days; P < 0.01) and hospital stay (14.0 (9.2-22.2) vs 14.8 (10.0-26.8) days; P = 0.01) were reduced. Rate of severe vasoplegia (21.0% vs 19.6%; P > 0.20) and acute kidney injury (11.8% vs 13.7%; P = 0.11) was not significantly different between the cohorts.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In-line filtration with finer 0.2 and 1.2 μm filters may be associated with less organ dysfunction and less inflammation in critically ill adult patients.

Some in vitro and in vivo studies have addressed the protective effects of silymarin against cisplatin nephrotoxicity. This study evaluated the effects of silymarin administration on cisplatin nephrotoxicity as the first human study. During this pilot, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effect of oral silymarin 420 mg daily in three divided doses starting 24-48 h before the initiation of cisplatin infusion and continuing to the end of three 21-day cisplatin-containing chemotherapy courses on cisplatin-induced renal electrolytes wasting and kidney function were assessed. Cisplatin-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred in 8% of the patients. Urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin to urine creatinine ratio (NGAL/Cr) and urinary magnesium and potassium wasting increased significantly after cisplatin infusion in both groups. Significant positive correlation was found between cumulative dose of cisplatin and urine NGAL/Cr after three courses of cisplatin infusion. Incidence of AKI and the magnitude of urinary magnesium and potassium wasting did not differ between silymarin and placebo groups. No adverse reaction was reported by silymarin administration. Prophylactic administration of conventional form of silymarin tablets could not prevent cisplatin-induced urine electrolyte wasting or renal function impairment."
MODIFIED TREATMENT OF HEPATORENAL SYNDROME TYPE I DEPENDING ON THE STAGE OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY.,"N Slyvka, I Rusnak, L Zub, Y Kulachek, V Kulachek, M Al Salama, O Rovinskyi, N Slyvkaet al.",2021 May:(314):125-128.,Georgian Med News,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34248041/,No keywords found,"Hepatorenal syndrome is a severe complication of liver cirrhosis which is difficult to treat because of a very fast course and lack of adequate dosing recommendations due to the stage of the disease. In this study we aimed to refine the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome type I by modifying the dose of terlipressin, depending on the stage of acute kidney injury (AKI). Objective - to improve the treatment method of hepatorenal syndrome type I in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis by selecting the dose of terlipressin depending on the stage of acute kidney injury. For this study were enrolled 161 patients with diagnosis alcoholic liver cirrhosis, complicated with the hepatorenal syndrome. All patients were were randomly divided into control (group 1) (n=79) and study (group 2) (n=82) groups depending on the treatment received (terlipressin in the standard dosage or modified by the response-guided titration method). If the serum creatinine level decreased less than 25% from the baseline, the dose of terlipressin was gradually increased but did not accede 12 mg/24 hours. The stage of AKI was diagnosed using the criteria of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury, 2012. The risk of short term mortality (within the first 29 days) was prognosed by Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The kidney function improved better in persons with a modified dose of terlipressin: the complete response rate in them was 81.7%. The response rate in those who received the standard treatment, was 66.7% only (p˂0.05). It was found that the effective dosage of terlipressin is 3 mg/24 for AKI stage I; 6 mg/24 - for AKI stage II; 12 mg/24 - for AKI stage III. The relapse of the disease occurred only in 23.2% patients with modified treatment against 40.1% in the control group (p˂0.05). Short term survival was also significantly higher in the study group - 54.9%, while in the control group it was 37% only (p˂0.05). Thus, correction of terlipressin dosage could improve the results of the treatment and reduce mortality in patients with hepatorenal syndrome type I."
Electrolytes supplementation can decrease the risk of nephrotoxicity in patients with solid tumors undergoing chemotherapy with cisplatin.,"Omary M S Minzi, Tatu E Lyimo, Francis F Furia, Alphonce I Marealle, Manase Kilonzi, George M Bwire, Christina Malichewe, Omary M S Minziet al.",2020 Sep 23,BMC Pharmacol Toxicol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32967726/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cisplatin is an important drug in the treatment of various Cancers. However, this drug causes nephrotoxicity that is linked to electrolyte derangement. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of electrolyte supplementation in reducing kidney injury in patients receiving cisplatin-based regimen.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was non-randomized interventional study conducted at Ocean Road Cancer Institute (ORCI) among patients with confirmed solid tumors. Patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy at a dose of ≥50 mg with intravenous normal saline supplemented with Magnesium, Calcium and Potassium (triple electrolyte supplementation) were compared with those who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy with normal saline alone. The patients were followed up for 4 weeks and serum creatinine was measured at every visit. Nephrotoxicity was defined as serum creatinine elevation > 1.5 times that at baseline.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 99 patients were recruited, whereby 49 patients (49.5%) received electrolyte supplementation (treatment group) and 50 patients (51.5%) did not receive electrolyte supplementation (control group). The incidence risk of nephrotoxicity was 20.41% (n = 10) in the treatment group and 54% (n = 27) in the control group. Patients in the control group were 2.6 times more likely to experience nephrotoxicity as compared to treatment group [Relative Risks (RR); 2.6, 95%CI; 1.5-4.9, P < 0.0001]. The most common malignancy was cervical cancer, n = 43 (87.8%) in treatment group and n = 45 (90.0%) in the control group (P = 0.590). The Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test revealed that electrolytes supplementation was associated with extended survival with less nephrotoxicity incidences [P = 0.0004; Hazard ratio (HR) 0.3149; 95% CI 0.165 to 0.6011].
    


          Conclusions:

Electronic health record intervention to increase use of NSAIDs as analgesia for hospitalised patients: a cluster randomised controlled study.,"Tasce Bongiovanni, Mark J Pletcher, Andrew Robinson, Elizabeth Lancaster, Li Zhang, Matthias Behrends, Elizabeth Wick, Andrew Auerbach, Tasce Bongiovanniet al.",2023 Dec 30,BMJ Health Care Inform,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38159932/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Prescribing non-opioid pain medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) medications, has been shown to reduce pain and decrease opioid use, but it is unclear how to effectively encourage multimodal pain medication prescribing for hospitalised patients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of prechecking non-opioid pain medication orders on clinician prescribing of NSAIDs among hospitalised adults.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a cluster randomised controlled trial of adult (≥18 years) hospitalised patients admitted to three hospital sites under one quaternary hospital system in the USA from 2 March 2022 to 3 March 2023. A multimodal pain order panel was embedded in the admission order set, with NSAIDs prechecked in the intervention group. The intervention group could uncheck the NSAID order. The control group had access to the same NSAID order. The primary outcome was an increase in NSAID ordering. Secondary outcomes include NSAID administration, inpatient pain scores and opioid use and prescribing and relevant clinical harms including acute kidney injury, new gastrointestinal bleed and in-hospital death.
    


          Results:

Both NSAID ordering (36 vs 43%, p<0.001) and administering (30 vs 34%, p=0.001) by the end of the first full hospital day were higher in the intervention (prechecked) group. There was no statistically significant difference in opioid outcomes during the hospitalisation and at discharge. There was a statistically but perhaps not clinically significant difference in pain scores during both the first and last full hospital day.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This cluster randomised controlled trial showed that prechecking an order for NSAIDs to promote multimodal pain management in the admission order set increased NSAID ordering and administration, although there were no changes to pain scores or opioid use. While prechecking orders is an important way to increase adoption, safety checks should be in place."
Mechanistic analyses in kidney transplant recipients prospectively randomized to two steroid free regimen-Low dose Tacrolimus with Everolimus versus standard dose Tacrolimus with Mycophenolate Mofetil.,"Opas Traitanon, James M Mathew, Aneesha Shetty, Sai Vineela Bontha, Daniel G Maluf, Yvonne El Kassis, Sook H Park, Jing Han, M Javeed Ansari, Joseph R Leventhal, Valeria Mas, Lorenzo Gallon, Opas Traitanonet al.",2019 May 28,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31136582/,No keywords found,"Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), the cornerstone of immunosuppression after transplantation are implicated in nephrotoxicity and allograft dysfunction. We hypothesized that combined low doses of CNI and Everolimus (EVR) may result in better graft outcomes and greater tolerogenic milieu. Forty adult renal transplant recipients were prospectively randomized to (steroid free) low dose Tacrolimus (TAC) and EVR or standard dose TAC and Mycophenolate (MMF) after Alemtuzumab induction. Baseline characteristics were statistically similar. EVR levels were maintained at 3-8 ng/ml. TAC levels were 4.5±1.9 and 6.4±1.5 ng/ml in the TAC+EVR and TAC+MMF group respectively. Follow up was 14±4 and 17±5 months respectively and included protocol kidney biopsies at 3 and 12 months post-transplantation. Rejection-rate was lower in the TAC+EVR group. However patient and overall graft survival, eGFR and incidence of adverse events were similar. TAC+EVR induced expansion of CD4+CD25hiFoxp3+ regulatory T cells as early as 3 months and expansion of IFN-γ+CD4+CD25hiFoxp3+ regulatory T cells at 12 months post-transplant. Gene expression profile showed a trend toward decreased inflammation, angiogenesis and connective tissue growth in the TAC+EVR Group. Thus, greater tolerogenic mechanisms were found to be operating in patients with low dose TAC+EVR and this might be responsible for the lower rejection-rate than in patients on standard dose TAC+MMF. However, further studies with longer follow up and evaluating impact on T regulatory cells are warranted."
Effects of Canagliflozin in Patients with Baseline eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2: Subgroup Analysis of the Randomized CREDENCE Trial.,"George Bakris, Megumi Oshima, Kenneth W Mahaffey, Rajiv Agarwal, Christopher P Cannon, George Capuano, David M Charytan, Dick de Zeeuw, Robert Edwards, Tom Greene, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Adeera Levin, Bruce Neal, Richard Oh, Carol Pollock, Norman Rosenthal, David C Wheeler, Hong Zhang, Bernard Zinman, Meg J Jardine, Vlado Perkovic, George Bakriset al.",2020 Dec 7,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33214158/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial demonstrated that the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD. Little is known about the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The participants in the CREDENCE study had type 2 diabetes mellitus, a urinary albumin-creatinine ratio >300-5000 mg/g, and an eGFR of 30 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at screening. This post hoc analysis evaluated participants with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at randomization.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      Effects of eGFR slope through week 130 were analyzed using a piecewise, linear, mixed-effects model. Efficacy was analyzed in the intention-to-treat population, on the basis of Cox proportional hazard models, and safety was analyzed in the on-treatment population. At randomization (an average of 29 days after screening), 174 of 4401 (4%) participants had an eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (mean [SD] eGFR, 26 [3] ml/min per 1.73 m2).
    


          Results:
        
      
      From weeks 3 to 130, there was a 66% difference in the mean rate of eGFR decline with canagliflozin versus placebo (mean slopes, -1.30 versus -3.83 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; difference, -2.54 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 4.17). Effects of canagliflozin on kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes were consistent for those with eGFR <30 and ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (all P interaction >0.20). The estimate for kidney failure in participants with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.27) was similar to those with eGFR ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; P interaction=0.80). There was no imbalance in the rate of kidney-related adverse events or AKI associated with canagliflozin between participants with eGFR <30 and ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (all P interaction >0.12).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This post hoc analysis suggests canagliflozin slowed progression of kidney disease, without increasing AKI, even in participants with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2."
A randomized open label study of 'imipenem vs. cefepime' in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.,"Ankur Jindal, Manoj Kumar, Ajeet S Bhadoria, Rakhi Maiwall, Shiv K Sarin, Ankur Jindalet al.",2016 May,Liver Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26474358/,No keywords found,"Background & aims:
        
      
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), in the presence of bacterial resistance or failure of third generation cephalosporins (3rd GC) has poor outcome. Empirical antibiotic(s) options are limited in these scenarios.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Consecutive cirrhotics with SBP because of hospital acquired SBP (>48 h of admission), microbial resistance or non-response (no resolution of SBP at 48 h) were randomized to Cefepime (n = 88) or Imipenem (n = 87) plus standard medical therapy. We assessed for 'response at 48 h' (reduction in ascitic fluid absolute neutrophil count (ANC) by >25% at 48 h), resolution of SBP (<250 cu/mm ANC at day 5) and their clinical outcome.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 957 paracentesis in 1200 hospitalized cirrhotics, 253 (26.4%) had SBP and 175 (69.6%) were randomized. Baseline parameters were comparable in two groups. Response at 48 h (58.6% vs. 51.7%; P = 0.4) and resolution of SBP in those with response at 48 h were comparable with no difference in mortality at week 2, month 1 and 3. Patients with 'No response at 48 h' had higher mortality compared with responders (73.8% vs. 25%; P < 0.001). Resolution of SBP was associated with 'response at 48 h' and septic shock, latter being main pre-terminal event. AKI at enrolment [Hazard ratio (HR), 2.6], pneumonia [HR, 2.9], septic shock [HR, 2.2] and response at 48 h [HR, 4.6] predicted poor outcome.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In hospitalized cirrhotics with SBP and risk factors for treatment failure, cefepime showed comparable efficacy and survival to imipenem. Non-response to therapy at 48 h is a reliable predictor of treatment failure and mortality. Antibiotic combinations and novel options are needed for these patients."
"Efficacy of Brazilian green propolis (EPP-AF®) as an adjunct treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A randomized, controlled clinical trial.","Marcelo Augusto Duarte Silveira, David De Jong, Andresa Aparecida Berretta, Erica Batista Dos Santos Galvão, Juliana Caldas Ribeiro, Thiago Cerqueira-Silva, Thais Chaves Amorim, Luis Filipe Miranda Rebelo da Conceição, Marcel Miranda Dantas Gomes, Maurício Brito Teixeira, Sergio Pinto de Souza, Marcele Helena Celestino Alves Dos Santos, Raissa Lanna Araújo San Martin, Márcio de Oliveira Silva, Monique Lírio, Lis Moreno, Julio Cezar Miranda Sampaio, Renata Mendonça, Silviana Salles Ultchak, Fabio Santos Amorim, João Gabriel Rosa Ramos, Paulo Benigno Pena Batista, Suzete Nascimento Farias da Guarda, Ana Verena Almeida Mendes, Rogerio da Hora Passos                              ;, BeeCovid Team, Marcelo Augusto Duarte Silveiraet al.",2021 Jun:138:111526.,Biomed Pharmacother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34311528/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) promotes challenging immune and inflammatory phenomena. Though various therapeutic possibilities have been tested against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most adequate treatment has not yet been established. Propolis is a natural product with considerable evidence of immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory activities, and experimental data point to potential against viral targets. We hypothesized that propolis can reduce the negative effects of COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center trial, hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients were treated with a standardized green propolis extract (EPP-AF®️) as an adjunct therapy. Patients were allocated to receive standard care plus an oral dose of 400 mg or 800 mg/day of green propolis for seven days, or standard care alone. Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency duration. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Patients were followed for 28 days after admission.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We enrolled 124 patients; 40 were assigned to EPP-AF®️ 400 mg/day, 42 to EPP-AF®️ 800 mg/day, and 42 to the control group. The length of hospital stay post-intervention was shorter in both propolis groups than in the control group; lower dose, median 7 days versus 12 days (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.23 to -0.07; p = 0.049) and higher dose, median 6 days versus 12 days (95% CI -7.00 to -1.09; p = 0.009). Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. In the high dose propolis group, there was a lower rate of acute kidney injury than in the controls (4.8 vs 23.8%), (odds ratio [OR] 0.18; 95% CI 0.03-0.84; p = 0.048). No patient had propolis treatment discontinued due to adverse events.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Addition of propolis to the standard care procedures resulted in clinical benefits for the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially evidenced by a reduction in the length of hospital stay. Consequently, we conclude that propolis can reduce the impact of COVID-19."
The c-Met Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor JNJ-38877605 Causes Renal Toxicity through Species-Specific Insoluble Metabolite Formation.,"Martijn P Lolkema#, Hilde H Bohets#, Hendrik-Tobias Arkenau, Ann Lampo, Erio Barale, Maja J A de Jonge, Leni van Doorn, Peter Hellemans, Johann S de Bono, Ferry A L M Eskens, Martijn P Lolkemaet al.",2015 May 15,Clin Cancer Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25745036/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met plays an important role in tumorigenesis and is a novel target for anticancer treatment. This phase I, first-in-human trial, explored safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and initial antitumor activity of JNJ-38877605, a potent and selective c-Met inhibitor.
    


          Experimental design:
        
      
      We performed a phase I dose-escalation study according to the standard 3+3 design.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Even at subtherapeutic doses, mild though recurrent renal toxicity was observed in virtually all patients. Renal toxicity had not been observed in preclinical studies in rats and dogs. Additional preclinical studies pointed toward the rabbit as a suitable toxicology model, as the formation of the M10 metabolite of JNJ-38877605 specifically occurred in rabbits and humans. Additional toxicology studies in rabbits clearly demonstrated that JNJ-38877605 induced species-specific renal toxicity. Histopathological evaluation in rabbits revealed renal crystal formation with degenerative and inflammatory changes. Identification of the components of these renal crystals revealed M1/3 and M5/6 metabolites. Accordingly, it was found that humans and rabbits showed significantly increased systemic exposure to these metabolites relative to other species. These main culprit insoluble metabolites were generated by aldehyde oxidase activity. Alternative dosing schedules of JNJ-3877605 and concomitant probenecid administration in rabbits failed to prevent renal toxicity at dose levels that could be pharmacologically active.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Combined clinical and correlative preclinical studies suggest that renal toxicity of JNJ-38877605 is caused by the formation of species-specific insoluble metabolites. These observations preclude further clinical development of JNJ-38877605."
A Randomized Phase 2 Study of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid Hydrochloride and Sodium Ferrous Citrate for the Prevention of Nephrotoxicity Induced by Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy of Lung Cancer.,"Kodai Kawamura, Hidekazu Matsushima, Hiroshi Sakai, Akira Iwashima, Sukeyuki Nakamura, Tohru Kojima, Shinichi Sasaki, Takehiko Shigenaga, Ichiro Natsume, Takaaki Sasaki, Yoshinobu Ohsaki, Kentaro Iwanaga, Koichi Nishi, Yoichiro Mitsuishi, Hirokazu Taniguchi, Kazuhiro Sato, Mitsugu Yamauchi, Motowo Nakajima, Kazuhisa Takahashi, Kodai Kawamuraet al.",2022,Oncology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36099876/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Cisplatin-based chemotherapy was established in the 1980s, and it has been improved by the development of a short hydration protocol in lung cancer therapy. However, cisplatin-based chemotherapy is still associated with renal toxicity. Because 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) with sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) is known to be a mitochondrial activator and a heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inducer, 5-ALA with SFC is speculated to mitigate cisplatin-induced renal inflammation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We investigated the effects of oral administration of 5-ALA with SFC for preventing cisplatin-based nephrotoxicity in patients with lung cancer and evaluated its benefits for patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the significance of the difference between the serum creatinine (sCr) levels of the patients administered 5-ALA with SFC and those given placebo after course 1 of chemotherapy. The difference in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between the two groups was also evaluated as the secondary endpoint.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The double-blind, randomized two-arm studies were conducted at 15 medical facilities in Japan; 54 male and 20 female patients with lung cancer who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy between the ages of 42 and 75 years were included in the study. The compliance rate was greater than 94% in the primary assessment and subsequent drug administration periods. All enrolled patients completed the four cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy with short hydration. The average level of sCr on day 22 of course 1 was 0.707 mg/dL in the group treated with 5-ALA and SFC and 0.735 mg/dL in the placebo group, respectively, and the sCr in the test group was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (p = 0.038). In addition, the eGFR was significantly higher in the SPP-003 group than in the placebo group up to day 1 of course 3 (84.66 and 75.68 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively, p = 0.02) and kept better even after the last administration of the study drug (82.37 and 73.49 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively, p = 0.013).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The oral administration of 5-ALA with SFC is beneficial to patients undergoing cisplatin-based chemotherapy for lung cancer with short hydration."
Effect of methylprednisolone on acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a cardiopulmonary bypass pump: a randomized controlled trial.,"Amit X Garg, Matthew T V Chan, Meaghan S Cuerden, P J Devereaux, Seyed Hesameddin Abbasi, Ainslie Hildebrand, François Lamontagne, Andre Lamy, Nicolas Noiseux, Chirag R Parikh, Vlado Perkovic, Mackenzie Quantz, Antoine Rochon, Alistair Royse, Daniel I Sessler, Pallav J Shah, Jessica M Sontrop, Georgios I Tagarakis, Kevin H Teoh, Jessica Vincent, Michael Walsh, Jean-Pierre Yared, Salim Yusuf, Richard P Whitlock                              ;, SIRS Investigators, Amit X Garget al.",2019 Mar 4,CMAJ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30833491/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Perioperative corticosteroid use may reduce acute kidney injury. We sought to test whether methylprednisolone reduces the risk of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a prespecified substudy of a randomized controlled trial involving patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (2007-2014); patients were recruited from 79 centres in 18 countries. Eligibility criteria included a moderate-to-high risk of perioperative death based on a preoperative score of 6 or greater on the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation I. Patients (n = 7286) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous methylprednisolone (250 mg at anesthetic induction and 250 mg at initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass) or placebo. Patients, caregivers, data collectors and outcome adjudicators were unaware of the assigned intervention. The primary outcome was postoperative acute kidney injury, defined as an increase in the serum creatinine concentration (from the preoperative value) of 0.3 mg/dL or greater (≥ 26.5 μmol/L) or 50% or greater in the 14-day period after surgery, or use of dialysis within 30 days after surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury occurred in 1479/3647 patients (40.6%) in the methylprednisolone group and in 1426/3639 patients (39.2%) in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.11). Results were consistent across several definitions of acute kidney injury and in patients with preoperative chronic kidney disease.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Intraoperative corticosteroid use did not reduce the risk of acute kidney injury in patients with a moderate-to-high risk of perioperative death who had cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Our results do not support the prophylactic use of steroids during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT00427388."
A randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial on protective effects of pentoxifylline on gentamicin nephrotoxicity in infectious patients.,"Seyed Ruhollah Mousavinasab, Zohreh Akhoundi-Meybodi, Laleh Mahmoudi, Iman Karimzadeh, Seyed Ruhollah Mousavinasabet al.",2021 Aug,Clin Exp Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33792832/,No keywords found,"Background and objective:
        
      
      Renal toxicity has limited gentamicin use in clinical practice. The aim of the present clinical trial was to assess the possible nephroprotective effects of pentoxifylline (PTX) against gentamicin nephrotoxicity.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on patients who had the indication for systemic gentamicin for at least 7 days. Sixty people were selected and randomly assigned. For patients in the intervention and control groups, 400 mg PTX sustained release tablet and placebo were given orally three times daily, respectively. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic information of patients were recorded. malondialdehyde (MDA) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels in serum were measured on days 0 and 7.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of nephrotoxicity in the placebo group was 19.6 times higher than that in the PTX group (OR = 19.6, 95%CI = 3.08-114.32; P value = 0.001). The mean ± SD time onset of ATN was 4.00 ± 2.32 and 5.58 ± 1.59 days in PTX and placebo recipients, respectively (P value < 0.001). No significant differences were observed for hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, potassium and magnesium wasting between the two groups. The mean ± SD levels of serum MDA and TNF-α at day 7 were significantly lower in the PTX compared to those in the placebo group (P value < 0.001 for both indexes).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The co-administration of 400 mg PTX orally three times daily along with gentamicin was both well-tolerated and effective in preventing the nephrotoxicity of gentamicin in patients with different infectious diseases."

      Saline, the intravenous fluid most commonly administered to critically ill adults, contains a high chloride content, which may be associated with acute kidney injury and death. Whether using balanced crystalloids rather than saline decreases the risk of acute kidney injury and death among critically ill adults remains unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) is a pragmatic, cluster-level allocation, cluster-level crossover trial being conducted between 1 June 2015 and 30 April 2017 in five intensive care units at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, TN, USA. SMART compares saline (0.9% sodium chloride) with balanced crystalloids (clinician's choice of lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A®). Each intensive care unit is assigned to provide either saline or balanced crystalloids each month, with the assigned crystalloid alternating monthly over the course of the trial. All adults admitted to participating intensive care units during the study period are enrolled and followed until hospital discharge or 30 days after enrollment. The anticipated enrollment is approximately 14,000 patients. The primary outcome is Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30 days-the composite of in-hospital death, receipt of new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (discharge creatinine ≥200% of baseline creatinine). Secondary clinical outcomes include in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, vasopressor-free days, and renal replacement therapy-free days. Secondary renal outcomes include new renal replacement therapy receipt, persistent renal dysfunction, and incidence of stage 2 or higher acute kidney injury.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This ongoing pragmatic trial will provide the largest and most comprehensive comparison to date of clinical outcomes with saline versus balanced crystalloids among critically ill adults.

The neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) are introduced as the most promising urine biomarkers to detect DGF. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin C, well-known potent antioxidants that scavenge free radicals, may alleviate kidney injury. This study investigated the protective effects of NAC alone and in combination with vitamin C on DGF, by measuring IL-18 and NGAL in living donor kidney transplantations.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Patients transplanted between January 2011 and February 2013 were randomly divided into 3 groups to receive routine anti-rejection medication only (n = 32), NAC plus routine immunosuppressive regimen (NAC group; n = 33), and NAC and vitamin C plus routine regimen (NAC and vitamin C group; n = 19). Urine samples were taken 4 hours and 24 hours after transplantation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were utilized for measuring urine NGAL and IL-18.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no significant differences in the DGF prevalence and its duration between the study arms. Although the levels of NGAL and IL-18 decreased in the NAC and NAC and vitamin C groups, these reductions were not significant. Glomerular filtration rate at 30 and 60 days after transplantation were not significantly different between study groups, either.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results showed that NAC is a safe drug without significant adverse effects in kidney transplant recipients; however, its potential useful effects on urinary biomarkers of DGF were not illustrated in the present study."
A minimal impact of long-term S-flurbiprofen plaster application on kidney function in osteoarthritis patients.,"Noboru Otsuka, Ikuko Yataba, Isao Matsushita, Hideo Matsumoto, Yuichi Hoshino, Yoshio Terada, Noboru Otsukaet al.",2017 Dec,Clin Exp Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28378068/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The number of kidney injury due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is the largest among drug-induced kidney diseases. Newly developed NSAID plaster containing S-flurbiprofen (SFP) shows innovative percutaneous absorption. However, systemic exposure to SFP following the repeated application of 80 mg/day was estimated as comparable to that of oral 120 mg/day flurbiprofen and prolonged use of topical NSAIDs is common in clinical practice. Thus, we report the safety focusing on the kidney function after long-term application of SFP plaster (SFPP).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 201 osteoarthritis patients (mean age; 66.3, 151 females, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate; 74.6 mL/min/1.73 mm2) were applied 40 or 80 mg SFPP for 52 weeks, and kidney function was examined by blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), eGFR, and urinalysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      161 (80.1%) patients completed 52-week application. In both groups of 40 and 80 mg, small but statistically significant increases were observed in BUN (mean 1.91 and 1.89 mg/dL, p < 0.05) and SCr (mean 0.019 and 0.022 mg/dL, p < 0.05). Although abnormal changes in laboratory test for renal function were observed in seven patients, all the changes were small and subclinical. Acute kidney injury was observed in two patients. Meanwhile, the investigators denied the relevance of SFPP according to the clinical course.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Toward the end of 52-week application, a statistically significant increase in SCr was observed in both 40 and 80 mg, but increment was small and subclinical. Attention should be paid to kidney function when applying SFPP to patients with multiple risk factors."
"Switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to tenofovir alafenamide in antiretroviral regimens for virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection: a randomised, active-controlled, multicentre, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority study.","Anthony Mills, Jose R Arribas, Jaime Andrade-Villanueva, Giovanni DiPerri, Jan Van Lunzen, Ellen Koenig, Richard Elion, Matthias Cavassini, Jose Valdez Madruga, Jason Brunetta, David Shamblaw, Edwin DeJesus, Chloe Orkin, David A Wohl, Indira Brar, Jeffrey L Stephens, Pierre-Marie Girard, Gregory Huhn, Andrew Plummer, Ya-Pei Liu, Andrew K Cheng, Scott McCallister                              ;, GS-US-- team, Anthony Millset al.",2016 Jan,Lancet Infect Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26538525/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Antiretroviral regimens containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate have been associated with renal toxicity and reduced bone mineral density. Tenofovir alafenamide is a novel tenofovir prodrug that reduces tenofovir plasma concentrations by 90%, thereby decreasing off-target side-effects. We aimed to assess whether efficacy, safety, and tolerability were non-inferior in patients switched to a regimen containing tenofovir alafenamide versus in those remaining on one containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomised, actively controlled, multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we recruited HIV-1-infected adults from Gilead clinical studies at 168 sites in 19 countries. Patients were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL per min or greater, and were taking one of four tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimens for at least 96 weeks before enrolment. With use of a third-party computer-generated sequence, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive a once-a-day single-tablet containing elvitegravir 150 mg, cobicistat 150 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg (tenofovir alafenamide group) or to carry on taking one of four previous tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimens (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group) for 96 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by previous treatment regimen in blocks of six. Patients and treating physicians were not masked to the assigned study regimen; outcome assessors were masked until database lock. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who received at least one dose of study drug who had undetectable viral load (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) at week 48. The non-inferiority margin was 12%. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01815736.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between April 12, 2013 and April 3, 2014, we enrolled 1443 patients. 959 patients were randomly assigned to the tenofovir alafenamide group and 477 to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group. Viral suppression at week 48 was noted in 932 (97%) patients assigned to the tenofovir alafenamide group and in 444 (93%) assigned to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (adjusted difference 4·1%, 95% CI 1·6-6·7), with virological failure noted in ten and six patients, respectively. The number of adverse events was similar between the two groups, but study drug-related adverse events were more common in the tenofovir alafenamide group (204 patients [21%] vs 76 [16%]). Hip and spine bone mineral density and glomerular filtration were each significantly improved in patients in the tenofovir alafenamide group compared with those in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Switching to a tenofovir alafenamide-containing regimen from one containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was non-inferior for maintenance of viral suppression and led to improved bone mineral density and renal function. Longer term follow-up is needed to better understand the clinical impact of these changes.

Efficacy and safety of 20% albumin fluid loading in healthy subjects: a comparison of four resuscitation fluids.,"Shailesh Bihari, Ubbo F Wiersema, Rebecca Perry, David Schembri, Tara Bouchier, Dani Dixon, Teresa Wong, Andrew D Bersten, Shailesh Bihariet al.",2019 Jun 1,J Appl Physiol (1985),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30998121/,"0.9% saline, stroke volume, 20% albumin, 4% albumin, Hartmann's solution, echocardiography, healthy volunteers, pulmonary function test, stroke work.","Recently, buffered salt solutions and 20% albumin (small volume resuscitation) have been advocated as an alternative fluid for intravenous resuscitation. The relative comparative efficacy and potential adverse effects of these solutions have not been evaluated. In a randomized, double blind, cross-over study of six healthy male subjects we compared the pulmonary and hemodynamic effects of intravenous administration of 30 ml/kg of 0.9% saline, Hartmann's solution and 4% albumin, and 6 ml/kg of 20% albumin (albumin dose equivalent). Lung tests (spirometry, ultrasound, impulse oscillometry, diffusion capacity, and plethysmography), two- to three-dimensional Doppler echocardiography, carotid applanation tonometry, blood gases, serum/urine markers of endothelial, and kidney injury were measured before and after each fluid bolus. Data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA with effect of fluid type examined as an interaction. Crystalloids caused lung edema [increase in ultrasound B line (P = 0.006) and airway resistance (P = 0.009)], but evidence of lung injury [increased angiopoietin-2 (P = 0.019)] and glycocalyx injury [increased syndecan (P = 0.026)] was only observed with 0.9% saline. The colloids caused greater left atrial stretch, decrease in lung volumes, and increase in diffusion capacity than the crystalloids, but without pulmonary edema. Stroke work increased proportionally to increase in preload with all four fluids (R2 = 0.71). There was a greater increase in cardiac output and stroke volume after colloid administration, associated with a reduction in afterload. Hartmann's solution did not significantly alter ventricular performance. Markers of kidney injury were not affected by any of the fluids administrated. Bolus administration of 20% albumin is both effective and safe in healthy subjects. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Bolus administration of 20% albumin is both effective and safe in healthy subjects when compared with other commonly available crystalloids and colloidal solution."
Daily Lisinopril vs Placebo for Prevention of Chemoradiation-Induced Pulmonary Distress in Patients With Lung Cancer (Alliance MC1221): A Pilot Double-Blind Randomized Trial.,"Terence T Sio, Pamela J Atherton, Levi D Pederson, W Ken Zhen, Robert W Mutter, Yolanda I Garces, Daniel J Ma, James L Leenstra, Jean-Claude M Rwigema, Shaker Dakhil, James D Bearden, Sonja J van der Veen, Apar K Ganti, Steven E Schild, Robert C Miller, Terence T Sioet al.",2019 Mar 1,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30395904/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Chemoradiation (CRT) is an integral treatment modality for patients with locally advanced lung cancer. It has been hypothesized that current use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor during CRT may be protective for treatment-related lung damage and pneumonitis.
    


          Methods and materials:
        
      
      We conducted a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. Study-eligible patients receiving curative thoracic radiation therapy (RT) were randomly assigned to 20 mg of lisinopril or placebo once daily during and up to 3 months after RT. All patients received concurrent chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was adverse event profiling. Multiple patient-reported outcome (PRO) surveys, including the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale, Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Lung Cancer Questionnaire, were applied with a symptom experience questionnaire. Exploratory comparative statistics were used to detect differences between arms with χ2 and Kruskal-Wallis testing.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Five institutions enrolled 23 patients. However, accrual was less than expected. Eleven and 12 patients were in the placebo and lisinopril arms, respectively (mean age, 63.5 years; male, 62%). Baseline characteristics were balanced. Eighteen patients (86%) were former or current smokers. The primary endpoint was met; neither arm had grade 3 or higher hypotension, acute kidney injury, allergic reaction (medication-induced cough), or anaphylaxis (medication-related angioedema). Few PRO measures suggested that compared with the placebo arm, patients receiving lisinopril had less cough, less shortness of breath, fewer symptoms from lung cancer, less dyspnea with both walking and climbing stairs, and better overall quality of life (for all, P < .05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although underpowered because of low accrual, our results suggest that there was a clinical signal for safety-and possibly beneficial by limited PRO measures-in concurrently administering lisinopril during thoracic CRT to mitigate or prevent RT-induced pulmonary distress. Our results showed that a definitive, larger-scale, randomized phase 3 trial is needed in the future."
Forced fluid removal in intensive care patients with acute kidney injury: The randomised FFAKI feasibility trial.,"R E Berthelsen, A Perner, A K Jensen, B S Rasmussen, J U Jensen, J Wiis, M T Behzadi, M H Bestle, R E Berthelsenet al.",2018 Aug,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29664109/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Accumulation of fluids is frequent in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury and may be associated with increased mortality and decreased renal recovery. We present the results of a pilot trial assessing the feasibility of forced fluid removal in ICU patients with acute kidney injury and fluid accumulation of more than 10% ideal bodyweight.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The FFAKI-trial was a pilot trial of forced fluid removal vs standard care in adult ICU patients with moderate to high risk acute kidney injury and 10% fluid accumulation. Fluid removal was done with furosemide and/or continuous renal replacement therapy aiming at net negative fluid balance > 1 mL/kg ideal body weight/hour until cumulative fluid balance calculated from ICU admission reached less than 1000 mL.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After 20 months, we stopped the trial prematurely due to a low inclusion rate with 23 (2%) included patients out of the 1144 screened. Despite the reduced sample size, we observed a marked reduction in cumulative fluid balance 5 days after randomisation (mean difference -5814 mL, 95% CI -2063 to -9565, P = .003) with forced fluid removal compared to standard care. While the trial was underpowered for clinical endpoints, no point estimates suggested harm from forced fluid removal.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Forced fluid removal aiming at 1 mL/kg ideal body weight/hour may be an effective treatment of fluid accumulation in ICU patients with acute kidney injury. A definitive trial using our inclusion criteria seems less feasible based on our inclusion rate of only 2%."
Dobutamine reverses the cardio-suppressive effects of terlipressin without improving renal function in cirrhosis and ascites: a randomized controlled trial.,"Mads Israelsen, Emilie Kristine Dahl, Bjørn Stæhr Madsen, Signe Wiese, Flemming Bendtsen, Søren Møller, Annette Dam Fialla, Boye L Jensen, Aleksander Krag, Mads Israelsenet al.",2020 Feb 1,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31841026/,"AKI, HRS, acute kidney injury, hepatorenal, portal hypertension.","Acute kidney injury and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) are frequent complications in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. First-line treatment is terlipressin, which reverses HRS in ~40% of patients but also lowers cardiac output (CO). We aimed to investigate whether reversing the cardio-suppressive effect of terlipressin with the β-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine would increase CO and thereby increase the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We randomized 25 patients with cirrhosis, ascites, and impaired renal function (2:2:1): group A received terlipressin followed by the addition of dobutamine; group B received dobutamine and terlipressin as monotherapies; and group C received placebo. Renal and cardiac functions were assessed during 8 clearance periods of 30 min, and concentrations of vasoactive hormones were measured. Dobutamine as a monotherapy increased CO (1.03 L/min, P < 0.01) but had no significant effects on GFR. Renin (P < 0.05), angiotensin II (P < 0.005), and aldosterone (P < 0.05) increased after dobutamine infusion. Terlipressin as a monotherapy improved GFR (18.9 mL·min-1·m-2, P = 0.005) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (14 mmHg, P = 0.001) but reduced CO (-0.92 L/min, P < 0.005) and renin (P < .005). A combined treatment of dobutamine and terlipressin had a positive effect on CO (1.19 L/min, P < 0.05) and increased renin (P < 0.005), angiotensin II (P < 0.005), and aldosterone (P < 0.05), but it had no significant effects on MAP or GFR. Dobutamine reversed the cardio-suppressive effect of terlipressin in cirrhosis, ascites, and impaired renal function. However, dobutamine reduced peripheral vascular resistance, activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and did not improve GFR compared with terlipressin as a monotherapy. Therefore, dobutamine cannot be recommended in cirrhosis and ascites.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study shows that the cardio-suppressive effects of the vasopressin receptor agonist terlipressin can be reversed by dobutamine. This is a novel observation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Furthermore, we show that dobutamine reduced the peripheral vascular resistance and activated the renin-angiotensin system, whereas renal function was not further improved by terlipressin alone."
Analysis of the clinical characteristics of pediatric patients who experience ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy.,"Yuichiro Ide, Ryu Yanagisawa, Noriko Kubota, Kazuo Sakashita, Minoru Tozuka, Tomohiko Nakamura, Takayuki Honda, Yuichiro Ideet al.",2019 Dec,Pediatr Blood Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31535455/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Several kinds of pediatric hematological and/or malignant diseases are treated with chemotherapy regimens including ifosfamide (IFO). IFO-induced encephalopathy (IIE) is one of the serious side effects, but there is not enough evidence regarding the clinical features of IIE in children.
    


          Procedure:
        
      
      We performed a retrospective study on pediatric patients treated with chemotherapy regimens, including IFO, at a single center. We recorded the clinical characteristics of all patients; we compared the clinical characteristics between patients who developed IIE and those who did not.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 88 patients received a chemotherapy regimen including IFO. IIE developed in seven patients (8.0%). The median age of patients at the time of IIE development was 4.3 (range 1.4-6.5) years in the younger population. Six of seven patients with IIE improved with supportive therapy only; however, one patient died due to heart failure. Overall survival was not different between the two groups. Multivariable analysis revealed that the co-administration of cisplatin (CDDP) or carboplatin (CBDCA) was a significant risk factor associated with IIE. Although there was no significant difference in laboratory data between the groups before chemotherapy, patients who developed IIE showed exacerbation in several laboratory tests, including those for renal and liver functions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Renal dysfunction caused by the combination of nephrotoxic agents (IFO and CDDP/CBDCA) seems to be important for the development of pediatric IIE. It was thought to be difficult to predict IIE onset based on laboratory data before the initiation of chemotherapy regimens; however, careful observation of laboratory data during IFO chemotherapy regimens may help predict IIE onset and facilitate early treatment."
Determinants of Urinary Output Response to IV Furosemide in Acute Kidney Injury: A Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Study.,"Benjamin I Silbert, Kwok M Ho, Jeffrey Lipman, Jason A Roberts, Tomas B Corcoran, David J Morgan, Warren Pavey, Emilie Mas, Anne E Barden, Trevor A Mori, Benjamin I Silbertet al.",2016 Oct,Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27183025/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      This study assessed the determinants of urinary output response to furosemide in acute kidney injury; specifically, whether the response is related to altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Prospective cohort.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Tertiary ICU.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Thirty critically ill patients with acute kidney injury without preexisting renal impairment or recent diuretic exposure.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      A single dose of IV furosemide.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Baseline markers of intravascular volume status were obtained prior to administering furosemide. Six-hour creatinine clearance, hourly plasma/urinary furosemide concentrations, and hourly urinary output were used to assess furosemide pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics parameters. Of 30 patients enrolled, 11 had stage-1 (37%), nine had stage-2 (30%), and 10 had stage-3 (33%) Acute Kidney Injury Network acute kidney injury. Seventy-three percent were septic, 47% required norepinephrine, and 53% were mechanically ventilated. Urinary output doubled in 20 patients (67%) following IV furosemide. Measured creatinine clearance was strongly associated with the amount of urinary furosemide excreted and was the only reliable predictor of the urinary output after furosemide (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.93). In addition to an altered pharmacokinetics (p < 0.01), a reduced pharmacodynamics response to furosemide also became important when creatinine clearance was reduced to less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m (p = 0.01). Acute kidney injury staging and markers of intravascular volume, including central venous pressure, brain-natriuretic-peptide concentration, and fractional urinary sodium excretion were not predictive of urinary output response to furosemide.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The severity of acute kidney injury, as reflected by the measured creatinine clearance, alters both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of furosemide in acute kidney injury, and was the only reliable predictor of the urinary output response to furosemide in acute kidney injury."
Randomized Sirolimus-based Early Calcineurin Inhibitor Reduction in Liver Transplantation: Impact on Renal Function.,"Bettina M Buchholz, James W Ferguson, Andreas A Schnitzbauer, Peter Nightingale, Hans J Schlitt, Edward K Geissler, Darius F Mirza                                                            ;, International SiLVER study group, Bettina M Buchholzet al.",2020 May,Transplantation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31577671/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) after liver transplantation (LT) is associated with nephrotoxicity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Five-year follow-up data were retrieved from the randomized controlled multicenter SiLVER trial. Standard CNI-based mammalian target of rapamycin-free immunosuppression (group A, n = 264) was compared with a 50% reduction of CNI and introduction of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor Sirolimus (SIR) within 4-6 weeks after LT (group B, n = 261).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median MELD at LT was low with 10 (7-15) (group A) and 11 (8-15) (group B) in the intention-to-treat approach. CNI dose and CNI trough were reduced by 20% and 8% (group A) versus 55% and 56% (group B) at 3 months posttransplantation. Renal function was preserved at 3 months after LT in the SIR arm (estimated glomerular filtration rate 74 [57-95] versus 67 [55-85] mL/min/1.73m2 P = 0.004) but was similarly impaired thereafter compared with group A. The per protocol analysis identified LT recipients in group B with concomitant early CNI minimization and SIR treatment ≥ year 1 with significantly superior estimated glomerular filtration rate and lowest rate of chronic kidney disease (≥stage 3) from year 1 onwards until study end. Competing risk factors for renal disease (arterial hypertension, fat metabolism disorder, and hyperglycemia) were not associated with worse kidney function.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Prevention of CNI nephrotoxicity by SIR-based early CNI minimization protects renal function only short-term after LT in the intention-to-treat analysis of this low MELD cohort. Yet, selected LT recipients compliant with early CNI minimization and SIR maintenance achieved better long-term renal outcomes compared with real-world practice."
Chronic pain and analgesic use in CKD: implications for patient safety.,"Juliana Wu, Jennifer S Ginsberg, Min Zhan, Clarissa J Diamantidis, Jingjing Chen, Corinne Woods, Jeffrey C Fink, Juliana Wuet al.",2015 Mar 6,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25710806/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Chronic pain in predialysis CKD is not fully understood. This study examined chronic pain in CKD and its relationship with analgesic usage.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      Data include baseline visits from 308 patients with CKD enrolled between 2011 and 2013 in the Safe Kidney Care cohort study in Baltimore, Maryland. The Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale measured chronic pain severity. Analgesic prescriptions and over-the-counter purchases were recorded up to 30 days before visits, and were classified as a drug-related problem (DRP) based on an analgesic's nephrotoxicity and dose appropriateness at participants' eGFR. Participants were sorted by pain frequency and severity and categorized into ordinal groups. Analgesic use and the rate of analgesics with a DRP were reported across pain groups. Multivariate regression determined the factors associated with chronic pain and assessed the relationship between chronic pain and analgesic usage.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 187 (60.7%) participants who reported chronic pain. Factors associated with pain severity included arthritis, taking ≥12 medications, and lower physical function. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was reported by seven participants (5.8%) with no chronic pain. Mild and severe chronic pain were associated with analgesics with a DRP, with odds ratios of 3.04 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.12 to 8.29) and 5.46 (95% CI, 1.85 to 16.10), respectively. The adjusted rate of analgesics with a DRP per participant increased from the group with none to severe chronic pain, with rates of 0.07 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.13), 0.12 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.20) and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.27), respectively.
    


          Conclusions:

In the deadly earthquake that occurred in Sichuan Province of China on May 12, 2008, some victims suffered from severe damage to multiple organs and tissue and developed sepsis, a systematic inflammatory reaction resulting from infection and trauma. Xuebijing injection (CCXG) could beneficial for improvement of clinical symptoms in those patients, but no research has yet examined its potential. Objective • The study intended to investigate whether a combination of conventional treatment and CCXG was superior to conventional treatment alone, or the control group (CG), in the treatment of clinical symptoms in patients with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Design • The study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of individuals who were injured in an earthquake that occurred in the Sichuan Province of China on May 12, 2008, and who developed AKI. Setting • The study took place in the hospital associated with Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Chengdu, Sichuan, China). Participants • Participants were 55 injured individuals who were treated at the hospital. The CG included 27 patients and the CCXG group included 28 patients. Intervention • Both the intervention group (CCXG group) and the CG received the conventional treatment. The CCXG group was also given intravenous drips containing 100 mL of CCXG. The CG was given 100 mL of a 10% normal saline injection in addition to conventional treatment. Both received the treatments within 30 to 40 min, 3 ×/d. Outcome Measures • Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine phosphate kinase (CPK), serum creatinine (Cr), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured before treatment and on days 5, 7, and 10 after treatment. Results • The levels of CPK, BUN, Cr, and IL-6 for both groups were significantly lower than at baseline on day 5, 7, and 10 after treatment (P < .05). The levels of the CCXG group were significantly lower than those of the CG group on days 5, 7, and 10 (P < .05). Conclusions • As a supplement, CCXG is an effective method of improving the clinical symptoms of sepsis-induced AKI."
Presence of acute and chronic renal failure in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: results of a retrospective analysis from the Spanish PNH Registry.,"Ana Villegas, Ramiro Núñez, Anna Gaya, María Victoria Cuevas-Ruiz, José Miguel Bosch, Anna Carral, Beatriz Arrizabalaga, María Isabel Gómez-Roncero, Asunción Mora, Pilar Bravo, Esperanza Lavilla, Carmen Monteserín, Belén Hernández, Pilar Martínez-Barranco, Isidro Jarque, María Anunciación Urquía, Gloria García-Donas, Salut Brunet, Fernando Ataulfo González, Álvaro Urbano, Ana Villegaset al.",2017 Oct,Ann Hematol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28748287/,"Acute and chronic renal failure, Eculizumab, Glomerular filtration rate, Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), Renal function status.","Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, life-threatening blood disease. With the advent of eculizumab treatment, renal function has substantially improved, although no data from real-world clinical practice are available. An observational, retrospective, multicenter study was conducted in Spain on clinical data obtained from outpatient visits of patients with PNH (Spanish PNH Registry) who had experienced acute (ARF) or chronic (CRF) renal failure. Of the 128 patients registered (April 2014), 60 were diagnosed with classic PNH. Twenty-seven (45.0%) patients with a mean age of 48.5 (±16.2) years had renal failure, ARF or CRF, and were included in this study. Near half of the patients (n = 13; 48.1%) presented with ARF alone, 33.3% (n = 9) had CRF with episodes of ARF, while 18.5% (n = 5) were diagnosed with CRF alone. For patients with diagnosis of PNH and renal failure (n = 27), the median time to the first ARF episode was 6.5 (CI 95%; 2.2, 14.9) years, whereas the median to the diagnosis of CRF was 14.5 (CI 95%; 3.8, 19.2) years after the diagnosis of PNH. Patients with ARF (n = 22) were treated with eculizumab and did not experience new episodes of ARF, except for one patient with sepsis. Of the patients with CRF, two received treatment without experiencing further episodes of ARF. Sixteen patients who completed treatment (11 with ARF and 5 with ARF + CRF) recovered from the episode of ARF or from CRF. Of the remaining patients treated with eculizumab, one patient improved from stages III to II, three patients stabilized without showing disease progression, and one patient progressed from stages III to IV. Treatment with eculizumab in PNH patients has beneficial effects on renal function, preventing ARF and progression to CRF."
Possible protective effect of pantoprazole against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in head and neck cancer patients: a randomized controlled trial.,"Eman Ghonaim, Sahar El-Haggar, Suzy Gohar, Eman Ghonaimet al.",2021 Aug 6,Med Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34357466/,"Cisplatin, KIM-1, NGAL, Pantoprazole, Soluble FasL.","Cisplatin is used to treat solid malignancies including head and neck cancer. However, nephrotoxicity limits its use. In this study, we looked for a possible protective effect of pantoprazole against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. We used novel biomarkers for early detection of nephrotoxicity. Sixty chemotherapy naïve head and neck cancer patients completed the study. Following complete history taking and thorough clinical examination, patients were randomly divided into three groups: 20 patients in each. Group I (control group) received cisplatin without pantoprazole, groups II and III received pantoprazole 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, concurrently with cisplatin. Blood and urine samples were collected at baseline, and 48 h after the first and third cycles of cisplatin administration. Assessment of serum creatinine and soluble FasL (sFasL), as well as urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) was performed. Nephrotoxicity was detected in 6 patients in group I, none in group II and 3 patients in group III. Serum creatinine significantly increased at the end of treatment in group I compared to groups II and III. Group I also had significantly higher urinary KIM-1 and NGAL and serum sFasL compared to groups II and III after the first and third cycles. On the contrary, there was no significant difference between groups II and III. Pantoprazole prevented the increase in acute kidney injury biomarkers in cisplatin-treated patients. Therefore, it is a promising agent in reducing cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov identifier: NCT04217512, registered in January 2020 "" retrospectively registered""."
Effect of continuous intraoperative infusion of methoxamine on renal function in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor surgery: a randomized controlled trial.,"Xiaowei Guo, Jie Hu, Hanbing Xiao, Tianyu Liu, Zheng Niu, Min Wang, Dunyi Qi, Xiaowei Guoet al.",2020 Jun 13,BMC Anesthesiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32534584/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute renal injury (AKI) caused by hypotension often occurs in elderly patients after gastrointestinal tumor surgery. Although vasoactive drugs can increase effective filtration pressure, they may increase renal vascular resistance and reduce renal blood flow. The effect of methoxamine on renal function is not clear.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      After obtaining written informed consent, 180 elderly patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal tumor surgery were randomly allocated into two groups: M group (continuous infusion of methoxamine at 2 μg/kg/min) and N group (continuous infusion of normal saline). The patients' mean arterial pressure was maintained within 20% of baseline by a continuous infusion of methoxamine or normal saline. Maintenance fluid was kept at 5 mL/kg/h. According to Kidney disease improve global outcome (KDIGO) guidelines, creatinine was measured at 1, 2 and 7 days after operation, and urine volume at 6, 12 and 24 h after operation was measured to evaluate the occurrence of AKI. 162 patients were included in the final data analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Significant differences in the incidence of postoperative Acute kidney injury (M group: 7.5%; N group: 18.3%; P < 0.05), the frequency of hypotension (M group: 1 [1-3]; N group: 3 [1-5]; P < 0.05), and the duration of intraoperative hypotension (M group: 2[0-10]; N group: 10 [5-16]; P < 0.05) were identified between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that preoperative creatinine and the frequency of intraoperative hypotension were the common factors leading to the occurrence of postoperative AKI. The results of Cox multivariate analysis showed that age and AKI were independent risk factors for 30-day death.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Compared with the intraoperative continuous infusion of placebo and methoxamine, continuous infusion of 2 μg/kg/min methoxamine reduced the incidence of postoperative AKI and other clinical complications in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery by raising blood pressure and improved the prognosis of patients.

"A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of N-acetylcysteine for preventing amphotericin B-induced nephrotoxicity.","Iman Karimzadeh, Hossein Khalili, Mohammad Mahdi Sagheb, Shadi Farsaei, Iman Karimzadehet al.",2015,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26050706/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the effectiveness of oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) co-treatment in preventing amphotericin B (AmB)-induced nephrotoxicity (AIN), including creatinine clearance and biomarkers of renal function (cystatin C [Cys C] and kidney injury molecule-1 [KIM-1]).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Either placebo or 600 mg oral NAC was given twice daily during the treatment course of AmB. Renal function test, serum as well as urinary level of Cys C and urinary KIM-1 were determined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among the study population (n = 54), 23 (42.59%) patients developed AmB nephrotoxicity during their treatment course. NAC co-treatment was significantly associated with mitigating AmB nephrotoxicity (OR = 0.286, 95% CI: 0.082 - 0.993; p = 0.049). No statistically significant difference regarding accuracy of measured biomarkers including serum creatinine, serum and urine Cys C and urine KIM-1 at days 0 and 7 of treatment in predicting and detecting AmB nephrotoxicity was identified. The changes in mean serum and urine Cys C and urine KIM during AmB treatment within and between treatment groups were not statistically significant.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Co-treatment with 600 mg oral NAC twice a day during AmB treatment, after adjusting for multiple variables, was associated with prevention of AIN. However, significantly higher adverse reactions developed in the patients who were treated with NAC."
Effect of Intraoperative Goal-directed Balanced Crystalloid versus Colloid Administration on Major Postoperative Morbidity: A Randomized Trial.,"Barbara Kabon, Daniel I Sessler, Andrea Kurz;, Crystalloid–Colloid Study Team, Kamal Maheshwari, Rovnat Babazade, Alexa Fiffick, Ignacia Gazmuri, Michael Ghobrial, Hooman Honar, Michael Kot, Tatyana Kopyeva, Onur Koyuncu, Ian Lavery, Edward J Mascha, Amanda Naylor, Attila Podolyak, Eric Reville, Joseph Saxon, Iman Suleiman, Dongsheng Yang, Jing You, David W Dietz, Edith Fleischmann, Christian Reiterer, Oliver M Zotti, Anton Stift, Thomas Gruenberger, Mina Obradovic, Florian Luf, Jakob Muehlbacher, Samir Sljivic, Ahmed Bayoumi, Corinna Marschalek, Alexander Kaserer, Jasmin Rahimi, Klaus Eredics, Benedict Krischer, Erol Erdik, Jonas Rech, Sergio Bergese, Barbara Kabonet al.",2019 May,Anesthesiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30882476/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Crystalloid solutions leave the circulation quickly, whereas colloids remain for hours, thus promoting hemodynamic stability. However, colloids are expensive and promote renal toxicity in critical care patients. This study tested the hypothesis that goal-directed colloid administration during elective abdominal surgery decreases 30-day major complications more than goal-directed crystalloid administration.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this parallel-arm double-blinded multicenter randomized trial, adults having moderate- to high-risk open and laparoscopically assisted abdominal surgery with general anesthesia were randomly assigned to Doppler-guided intraoperative volume replacement with 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (n = 523) or lactated Ringer's solution (n = 534). The primary outcome was a composite of serious postoperative cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, gastrointestinal, renal, and coagulation complications that were assessed with a generalized estimating equation multivariate model. The primary safety outcome was a change in serum creatinine concentration up to 6 months postoperatively, compared to baseline concentrations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1,057 patients were included in the analysis. Patients assigned to crystalloid received a median [quartile 1, quartile 3] amount of 3.2 l [2.3, 4.4] of crystalloid, and patients assigned to colloid received 1.0 l [0.5, 1.5] of colloid and 1.8 l [1.2, 2.4] of crystalloid. The estimated intention-to-treat common effect relative risk for the primary composite was 0.90 for colloids versus crystalloids (95% CI: 0.65 to 1.23, P = 0.51), and 18% (91 of 523) of colloid patients and 20% (103 of 534) of crystalloid patients incurred at least one component of the primary outcome composite. There was no evidence of renal toxicity at any time.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Doppler-guided intraoperative hydroxyethyl starch administration did not significantly reduce a composite of serious complications. However, there was also no indication of renal or other toxicity."
When is it safe to start venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after blunt solid organ injury?

      The optimal time to initiate venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemoprophylaxis (VTEp) after blunt solid organ injury remains controversial, as VTE mitigation must be balanced against bleeding promulgation. Evidence from primarily small, retrospective, single-center work suggests that VTEp ≤48 hours is safe and effective. This study was undertaken to validate this clinical practice.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Blunt trauma patients presenting to 19 participating trauma centers in North America were screened over a 1-year study period beginning between August 1 and October 1, 2021. Inclusions were age older than 15 years; ≥1 liver, spleen, or kidney injury; and initial nonoperative management. Exclusions were transfers, emergency department death, pregnancy, and concomitant bleeding disorder/anticoagulation/antiplatelet medication. A priori power calculation stipulated the need for 1,158 patients. Time of VTEp initiation defined study groups: Early (≤48 hours of admission) versus Late (>48 hours). Bivariate and multivariable analyses compared outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 1,173 patients satisfied the study criteria with 571 liver (49%), 557 spleen (47%), and 277 kidney injuries (24%). The median patient age was 34 years (interquartile range, 25-49 years), and 67% (n = 780) were male. The median Injury Severity Score was 22 (interquartile range, 14-29) with Abbreviated Injury Scale Abdomen score of 3 (interquartile range, 2-3), and the median American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade of solid organ injury was 2 (interquartile range, 2-3). Early VTEp patients (n = 838 [74%]) had significantly lower rates of VTE (n = 28 [3%] vs. n = 21 [7%], p = 0.008), comparable rates of nonoperative management failure (n = 21 [3%] vs. n = 12 [4%], p = 0.228), and lower rates of post-VTEp blood transfusion (n = 145 [17%] vs. n = 71 [23%], p = 0.024) when compared with Late VTEp patients (n = 301 [26%]). Late VTEp was independently associated with VTE (odd ratio, 2.251; p = 0.046).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Early initiation of VTEp was associated with significantly reduced rates of VTE with no increase in bleeding complications. Venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis initiation ≤48 hours is therefore safe and effective and should be the standard of care for patients with blunt solid organ injury.

Different Doses of Empagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction.,"Zhengyang Hao, Yanzhou Zhang, Zhengyang Haoet al.",2022 Sep 30,Int Heart J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36104235/,"Cardiac function, High dose, SGLT2i.","It was unclear whether there are discrepancies among the efficacy and safety of different doses of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 25 mg and 10 mg of empagliflozin in HFrEF patients.In this 3-month, single-center, open-label, randomized, positive-controlled, parallel-group study, 100 patients with HFrEF were divided into two groups, namely, groups A (n = 50) and B (n = 50), which were given 25 mg/day and 10 mg/day of empagliflozin, respectively. Cardiac function indexes at baseline and at the end of the third month were compared between the two groups, as well as adverse events during the 3-month follow-up period. The primary outcome of this study was the change in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and the secondary outcomes were the change in the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and the incidences of hypotension, acute kidney injury (AKI), and genitourinary infections.At the end of the third month, the changes in the LVEF and LVEDD were greater in group A than those in group B (P < 0.05). During the 3-month follow-up period, the differences in the incidences of hypotension, AKI, and genitourinary infections between the two groups were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05).The results from this study suggested that 25 mg of empagliflozin might be better than 10 mg in improving heart function in HFrEF patients, and the safety profiles of 25 mg and 10 mg of empagliflozin are comparable. Further studies are expected to substantiate our speculations."

          Methods:
        
      
      In 2 parallel randomized controlled trials, diabetic patients were allocated to preoperative VRT (1 ml/kg/h of Hartmann's solution for 12 h) or usual care. Primary outcome was time to fitness for discharge. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury, postoperative complications, patient-reported quality of life (QoL), hospital resource use and markers of renal, cardiac and inflammatory injury.

Histopathologic impacts of everolimus introduction on kidney transplant recipients.,"T Nakamura, H Ushigome, T Takata, T Nakao, S Harada, K Koshino, T Suzuki, T Ito, S Nobori, N Yoshimura, T Nakamuraet al.",2015 Apr,Transplant Proc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25891700/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Introduction of everolimus (RAD) has been established as a new immunosuppressive medication for kidney transplant (KT) recipients. Administration of RAD is capable of reducing the dosage of coadministrated calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). However, histological investigations have rarely been performed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To clarify histopathologic effects of RAD, a total of 9 adult KT recipients were enrolled (RAD group, n = 5; Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) group, n = 4). Renal graft biopsies had been performed at 3 weeks and 1 year following KT.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no differences in 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survival rates (RAD group: 100%, 100%, and 80%, respectively; MMF group: 100%, 100%, and 75%, respectively), and patient survival between the 2 groups (no deaths during the 5 years post-transplantation). Interestingly, although 2 patients in the RAD group had developed CNI nephrotoxicity clinically, renal biopsies had proven no CNI-related lesions 1 year later, which might be due to the reduction in CNI. On the other hand, 1 patient, in the MMF group, had been diagnosed histologically with new-onset CNI nephrotoxicity 1 year following KT. Importantly, the frequency and mean arteriolar hyalinosis (ah) scores, which reflect CNI nephrotoxicity, were significantly higher in the MMF group at 1-year biopsy (P < .05, P < .0001). Two patients in the RAD group improved their ah scores between 3 weeks and 1 year.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pathological findings revealed that reversible CNI nephrotoxicity can be improved by RAD with reduced CNI maintenance therapy. It is reasonable to believe, therefore, that introduction of RAD is useful for patients who have been diagnosed with CNI nephrotoxicity."
Effect of ulinastatin on postoperative renal function in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy: a randomized trial.,"Bora Lee, Sook Young Lee, Na Young Kim, Koon Ho Rha, Young Deuk Choi, Sujung Park, So Yeon Kim, Bora Leeet al.",2017 Sep,Surg Endosc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28593413/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RLPN) is an emerging technique for treating small renal masses. Although RLPN has many advantages, ischemic kidney injury is inevitable during renal artery clamping. The overall incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) after partial nephrectomy has been reported to be up to 39%. Moreover, effective pharmacological protection against AKI after partial nephrectomy has not yet been demonstrated. Ulinastatin has been shown to protect the kidney from ischemia/reperfusion injury via its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of ulinastatin on postoperative kidney function in patients undergoing RLPN.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, patients undergoing RLPN received either intravenous ulinastatin (100,000 units/10 kg; ulinastatin group, n = 35) or the same volume of normal saline (control group, n = 35) for 1 h starting 10 min before renal artery clamping. The primary outcome was incidence of postoperative AKI. Secondary outcomes were levels of serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), cystatin C, and inflammatory markers and were measured before operation and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 h postoperatively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of postoperative AKI was 18% in the ulinastatin group, whereas it was 30% in the control group (p = 0.251). No significant differences in postoperative changes of serum creatinine, eGFR, or cystatin C were observed between the two groups. Postoperative inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and neutrophil percentage were significantly increased until 72 h after operation compared to the preoperative values in both groups, with no significant differences between the groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Administration of ulinastatin (100,000 units/10 kg) during the warm ischemia and reperfusion periods did not show any beneficial effects on postoperative kidney function or inflammatory responses in patients undergoing RLPN."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is common and results in increased morbidity and mortality. One possible mechanism for AKI is ischaemia-reperfusion injury caused by the extracorporeal circulation (ECC), resulting in an opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in the kidneys, which can lead to cell injury or cell death. Ciclosporin may block the opening of mPTP if administered before the ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We hypothesised that ciclosporin given before the start of ECC in cardiac surgery can decrease the degree of AKI.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      Ciclosporin to Protect Renal function In Cardiac Surgery (CiPRICS) study is an investigator-initiated double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel design, single-centre study performed at a tertiary university hospital. The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of ciclosporin to limit the degree of AKI in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. We aim to evaluate 150 patients with a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15-90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Study patients are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive study drug 2.5 mg/kg ciclosporin or placebo as an intravenous injection after anaesthesia induction but before start of surgery. The primary end point consists of relative P-cystatin C changes from the preoperative day to postoperative day 3. The primary variable will be tested using an analysis of covariance method. Secondary end points include evaluation of P-creatinine and biomarkers of kidney, heart and brain injury.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      The trial is conducted in compliance with the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice guidelines E6 (R1) and was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board, Lund and the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA).

Compound α-keto acid tablet supplementation alleviates chronic kidney disease progression via inhibition of the NF-kB and MAPK pathways.,"Meng Wang, Huzi Xu, Octavia Li-Sien Chong Lee Shin, Li Li, Hui Gao, Zhi Zhao, Fan Zhu, Han Zhu, Wangqun Liang, Kun Qian, Chunxiu Zhang, Rui Zeng, Hanjing Zhou, Ying Yao, Meng Wanget al.",2019 Apr 11,J Transl Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30975176/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Keto-analogues administration plays an important role in clinical chronic kidney disease (CKD) adjunctive therapy, however previous studies on their reno-protective effect mainly focused on kidney pathological changes induced by nephrectomy. This study was designed to explore the currently understudied alternative mechanisms by which compound α-ketoacid tablets (KA) influenced ischemia-reperfusion (IR) induced murine renal injury, and to probe the current status of KA administration on staving CKD progression in Chinese CKD patients at different stages.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In animal experiment, IR surgery was performed to mimic progressive chronic kidney injury, while KA was administrated orally. For clinical research, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to delineate the usage and effects of KA on attenuating CKD exacerbation. End-point CKD event was defined as 50% reduction of initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Kaplan-Meier analysis and COX proportional hazard regression model were adopted to calculate the cumulative probability to reach the end-point and hazard ratio of renal function deterioration.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In animal study, KA presented a protective effect on IR induced renal injury and fibrosis by attenuating inflammatory infiltration and apoptosis via inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. In clinical research, after adjusting basic demographic factors, patients at stages 4 and 5 in KA group presented a much delayed and slower incidence of eGFR decrease compared to those in No-KA group (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.115, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.021-0.639, p = 0.0134), demonstrating a positive effect of KA on staving CKD progression.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      KA improved IR induced chronic renal injury and fibrosis, and seemed to be a prospective protective factor in end stage renal disease."
Perioperative intravenous acetaminophen attenuates lipid peroxidation in adults undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass: a randomized clinical trial.,"Frederic T Billings th, Michael R Petracek, L Jackson Roberts nd, Mias Pretorius, Frederic T Billings thet al.",2015 Feb 23,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25705899/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) lyses erythrocytes and induces lipid peroxidation, indicated by increasing plasma concentrations of free hemoglobin, F2-isoprostanes, and isofurans. Acetaminophen attenuates hemeprotein-mediated lipid peroxidation, reduces plasma and urine concentrations of F2-isoprostanes, and preserves kidney function in an animal model of rhabdomyolysis. Acetaminophen also attenuates plasma concentrations of isofurans in children undergoing CPB. The effect of acetaminophen on lipid peroxidation in adults has not been studied. This was a pilot study designed to test the hypothesis that acetaminophen attenuates lipid peroxidation in adults undergoing CPB and to generate data for a clinical trial aimed to reduce acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      In a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, sixty adult patients were randomized to receive intravenous acetaminophen or placebo starting prior to initiation of CPB and for every 6 hours for 4 doses. Acetaminophen concentrations measured 30 min into CPB and post-CPB were 11.9 ± 0.6 μg/mL (78.9 ± 3.9 μM) and 8.7 ± 0.3 μg/mL (57.6 ± 2.0 μM), respectively. Plasma free hemoglobin increased more than 15-fold during CPB, and haptoglobin decreased 73%, indicating hemolysis. Plasma and urinary markers of lipid peroxidation also increased during CPB but returned to baseline by the first postoperative day. Acetaminophen reduced plasma isofuran concentrations over the duration of the study (P = 0.05), and the intraoperative plasma isofuran concentrations that corresponded to peak hemolysis were attenuated in those subjects randomized to acetaminophen (P = 0.03). Perioperative acetaminophen did not affect plasma concentrations of F2-isoprostanes or urinary markers of lipid peroxidation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intravenous acetaminophen attenuates the increase in intraoperative plasma isofuran concentrations that occurs during CPB, while urinary markers were unaffected.

      Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) is often complicated by hemodynamic instability, especially in patients with prior left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and appropriate choice of inotrope plays a vital role in perioperative management of these patients.
    


          Aim and objective:
        
      
      To study hemodynamic effects and immediate outcome of prophylactic infusion of levosimendan in patients with the LV dysfunction undergoing OPCAB surgery and whether this strategy helps in successful conduct of OPCAB surgery.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      After Institutional Ethics Committee approval, 60 patients posted for elective OPCAB surgery were randomly divided into two groups (n = 30 each). Patients with the LV ejection fraction <30% were included. Study group was started on injection levosimendan (@ 0.1 μg/kg/min) in the previous night before surgery and continued for 24 h including intraoperative period. Hemodynamic monitoring included heart rate, invasive blood pressure, cardiac index (CI), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulse oximetry, and arterial blood gases with serum lactates at as T0 (baseline), T1 (15 min after obtuse marginal and/or PDA anastomoses), T2 (at end of surgery), T3 (6 h after surgery in Intensive Care Unit [ICU]), T4 (12 h after surgery), and T5 (24 h after surgery in ICU). Vasopressor was added to maintain mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg. Chi-square/Fisher's exact/Mid P exact test and Student's t-tests were applied for categorical and continuous data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CI was greater and PCWP reduced significantly in Group L during intraoperative and early postoperative period. Serum lactate concentration was lower in patients pretreated with levosimendan. Incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) (36.6 vs. 6.6%; P = 0.01), low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) (30% vs. 6%; P = 0.02), and acute kidney injury (23.3% vs. 6.7%; P = 0.04) was less in Group L. Three patients (10%) in control group required conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) as compared to none in the study group. There was no difference regarding ICU or hospital stay and mortality in both groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Preoperative levosimendan helps in successful conduct of OPCAB and reduces the incidence of LCOS, POAF, conversion to CPB, and requirement of intra-aortic balloon pump."
Theophylline Population Pharmacokinetics and Dosing in Children Following Congenital Heart Surgery With Cardiopulmonary Bypass.,"Adam Frymoyer, Felice Su, Paul C Grimm, Scott M Sutherland, David M Axelrod, Adam Frymoyeret al.",2016 Sep,J Clin Pharmacol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26712558/,"acute kidney injury, aminophylline, congenital heart defect, pediatric, pharmacokinetics.","Children undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) frequently develop acute kidney injury due to renal ischemia. Theophylline, which improves renal perfusion via adenosine receptor inhibition, is a potential targeted therapy. However, children undergoing cardiac surgery and CPB commonly have alterations in drug pharmacokinetics. To help understand optimal aminophylline (salt formulation of theophylline) dosing strategies in this population, a population-based pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) from 71 children (median age 5 months; 90% range 1 week to 10 years) who underwent cardiac surgery requiring CPB and received aminophylline as part of a previous randomized controlled trial. A 1-compartment model with linear elimination adequately described the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. Weight scaled via allometry was a significant predictor of clearance and volume. In addition, allometric scaled clearance increased with age implemented as a power maturation function. Compared to prior reports in noncardiac children, theophylline clearance was markedly reduced across age. In the final population pharmacokinetic model, optimized empiric dosing regimens were developed via Monte Carlo simulations. Doses 50% to 75% lower than those recommended in noncardiac children were needed to achieve target serum concentrations of 5 to 10 mg/L."
Pharmacokinetics and safety of intravenous cidofovir for life-threatening viral infections in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.,"Amy E Caruso Brown, Mindy N Cohen, Suhong Tong, Rebecca S Braverman, James F Rooney, Roger Giller, Myron J Levin, Amy E Caruso Brownet al.",2015 Jul,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25733509/,No keywords found,"Children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at risk for life-threatening viral infections. Cidofovir is often used as a first-line agent for adenovirus infections, despite the absence of randomized controlled trials with HSCT patients, and as a second-line agent for resistant herpesvirus infections. The frequency and severity of adverse effects, particularly nephrotoxicity, in pediatric HSCT recipients are unclear, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of cidofovir in children have not previously been reported. This study was an open-label, nonrandomized, single-dose pilot study to determine the safety and PK of cidofovir in pediatric HSCT recipients with symptomatic adenovirus, nucleoside-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV), and/or human papovavirus infections. Subsequent dosing and frequency were determined by clinical response and side effects, as assessed by the treating physician. Blood and urine samples were obtained from patients for PK studies and assessment of toxicity and virologic response. Twelve patients were enrolled (median age, 9 years; 33.5 days posttransplantation). Four of seven patients with adenovirus infection were successfully treated and eventually cleared their infections. Four of twelve patients died of disseminated viral disease and multiorgan failure. Two of twelve patients had evidence of acute kidney injury after the first dose, and one of these patients developed chronic kidney disease; two other patients developed late nephrotoxicity. The mean drug half-life was 9.5 h. There was no correlation between nephrotoxicity and plasma maximum concentration, clearance, or half-life. PK were similar to those reported for adults, although the drug half-life was significantly longer than that for adults. Cidofovir was well tolerated in the majority of patients. However, effective therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to support patients until immune reconstitution is achieved."
Conventional Versus Prolonged Infusion of Meropenem in Neonates With Gram-negative Late-onset Sepsis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Abd Elazeez Shabaan, Islam Nour, Heba Elsayed Eldegla, Nehad Nasef, Basma Shouman, Hesham Abdel-Hady, Abd Elazeez Shabaanet al.",2017 Apr,Pediatr Infect Dis J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27918382/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Gram-negative bacteria are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm and term newborns. Meropenem has widespread efficacy and often allows for monotherapy in this group. Prolonged infusion instead of infusion over 30 minutes has been suggested to result in higher microbiologic efficacy.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare the clinical and microbiologic efficacy and safety of prolonged infusions versus conventional dosing of meropenem in neonates with Gram-negative late-onset sepsis (GN-LOS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted in neonates with GN-LOS admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), Mansoura University Children's Hospital, between August 2013 and June 2015. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous infusion of meropenem over 4 hours (infusion group) or 30 minutes (conventional group) at a dosing regimen of 20 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours and 40 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours in meningitis and Pseudomonas infection. Clinical and microbiologic success in eradication of infection were the primary outcomes. Neonatal mortality, meropenem-related (MR) duration of mechanical ventilation, MR length of NICU stay, total length of NICU stay, duration of respiratory support (RS), duration of mechanical ventilation, MR duration of inotropes and adverse effects were secondary outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 102 infants (51 in each group) were recruited. The infusion group demonstrated a significantly higher rate of clinical improvement and microbiologic eradication 7 days after starting meropenem therapy compared with the conventional group. Mortality and duration of RS were significantly less in the infusion group compared with conventional group. Acute kidney injury after meropenem treatment was significantly less in the infusion group compared with the conventional group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Prolonged infusion of meropenem in neonates with GN-LOS is associated with higher clinical improvement, microbiologic eradication, less neonatal mortality, shorter duration of RS and less acute kidney injury compared with the conventional strategy."
"The effect of spironolactone on calcineurin inhibitor induced nephrotoxicity: a multicenter randomized, double-blind, clinical trial (the SPIREN trial).","Line Aas Mortensen, Helle C Thiesson, Birgitte Tougaard, Martin Egfjord, Anne Sophie Lind Fischer, Claus Bistrup, Line Aas Mortensenet al.",2018 May 3,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29724188/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Calcineurin inhibitor induced nephrotoxicity contributes to late allograft failure in kidney transplant patients. Evidence points towards aldosterone to play a role in the development of fibrosis in multiple organs. Animal studies have indicated a beneficial effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists preventing calcineurin inhibitor induced nephrotoxicity. Only few studies have explored this effect in humans. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of spironolactone on glomerular filtration rate and fibrosis in kidney transplant patients.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Prospective, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial including 170 prevalent kidney transplant patients. Patients are randomized to spironolactone 25-50 mg/day or placebo for three years. Primary outcome is glomerular filtration rate evaluated by chrome-EDTA clearance. Secondary outcomes are 24-h protein excretion, amount of interstitial fibrosis in renal allograft biopsies, and cardiovascular events. As an exploratory outcome, we aim to identify markers of fibrosis in blood and urine.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Long term allograft survival remains a key issue in renal transplantation, partly due to calcineurin inhibitor induced nephrotoxicity. Evidence from animal- and small human studies indicate a beneficial effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism on renal function and fibrosis. This study aims to test this hypothesis in a sufficiently powered randomized clinical trial. Results might influence the future management of long term allograft survival in renal transplantation.

      Hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1) in patients with cirrhosis and ascites is a functional, potentially reversible, form of acute kidney injury characterized by rapid (<2 wk) and progressive deterioration of renal function. Terlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue that acts, via vascular vasopressin V1 receptors, as a systemic vasoconstrictor. We performed a phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous terlipressin plus albumin vs placebo plus albumin in patients with HRS-1.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Adult patients with cirrhosis, ascites, and HRS-1 (based on the 2007 International Club of Ascites criteria of rapidly deteriorating renal function) were assigned randomly to groups given intravenous terlipressin (1 mg, n = 97) or placebo (n = 99) every 6 hours with concomitant albumin. Treatment continued through day 14 unless the following occurred: confirmed HRS reversal (CHRSR, defined as 2 serum creatinine [SCr] values ≤1.5 mg/dL, at least 40 hours apart, on treatment without renal replacement therapy or liver transplantation) or SCr at or above baseline on day 4. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with confirmed CHRSR. Secondary end points included the incidence of HRS reversal (defined as at least 1 SCr value ≤1.5 mg/dL while on treatment), transplant-free survival, and overall survival. The study was performed at 50 investigational sites in the United States and 2 in Canada, from October 2010 through February 2013.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline demographic/clinical characteristics were similar between groups. CHRSR was observed in 19 of 97 patients (19.6%) receiving terlipressin vs 13 of 99 patients (13.1%) receiving placebo (P = .22). HRS reversal was achieved in 23 of 97 (23.7%) patients receiving terlipressin vs 15 of 99 (15.2%) receiving placebo (P = .13). SCr decreased by 1.1 mg/dL in patients receiving terlipressin and by only 0.6 mg/dL in patients receiving placebo (P < .001). Decreases in SCr and survival were correlated (r(2) = .882; P < .001). Transplant-free and overall survival were similar between groups. A significantly greater proportion of patients with CHRSR who received terlipressin survived until day 90 than patients who did not have CHRSR after receiving terlipressin (P < .001); this difference was not observed in patients who did vs did not have CHRSR after receiving placebo (P = .28). There were similar numbers of adverse events in each group, but patients in the terlipressin group had more ischemic events.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Terlipressin plus albumin was associated with greater improvement in renal function vs albumin alone in patients with cirrhosis and HRS-1. Patients had similar rates of HRS reversal with terlipressin as they did with albumin. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT01143246."

Median OS was 8·5 months for whole group (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7·9-9·1). Median OS in mGemOx was 9 months and 8·3 months in CisGem; p = 0·057 (hazard ratio = 0·78; 95% CI = 0·60-1·02). Restricted mean OS for follow-up limited to 30 months was 11·2 months (95% CI: 9·8-12·6) in mGemOx and 10·4 months (95% CI: 9·1-11·7) in CisGem. Difference of the mean was 0·8 months with 95% CI, exceeding 2 months (-1·1 to 2·7), hence rejecting equivalence.

Although commonly measured in urine, KIM-1 levels are also detectable in plasma, but its clinical and prognostic utility in ADHF is unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Baseline, 48- to 72-h, and 30-day KIM-1 plasma levels were measured in 874 subjects in the ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure) trial. Multivariable logistic and Cox models were used to assess the relationship between KIM-1 levels and outcomes during and after ADHF.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The median circulating KIM-1 level at baseline was 375.4 pg/ml (interquartile range [IQR]: 237.0 to 633.1 pg/ml), at 48 to 72 h was 373.7 pg/ml (IQR: 220.3 to 640.5 pg/ml), and at 30 days was 382.6 pg/ml (IQR: 236.5 to 638.0 pg/ml). There were no associations between KIM-1 levels and any 30-day outcomes. In univariable analysis, both baseline and follow-up KIM-1 were associated with greater 180-day mortality risk. However, after adjusting for blood urea nitrogen or creatinine in addition to established risk predictors from ASCEND-HF, higher KIM-1 at all time points during hospitalization was not associated with in-hospital or post-discharge outcomes (all p > 0.05), but KIM-1 levels measured at 30 days were associated independently with 180-day mortality (hazard ratio: 1.49; p = 0.04).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In our study cohort, circulating KIM-1 at baseline and during hospitalization was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes in ADHF after adjusting for standard indices of kidney function."
Non-interventional follow-up versus fluid bolus in RESPONSE to oliguria in hemodynamically stable critically ill patients: a randomized controlled pilot trial.,"Nina Inkinen, Ville Pettilä, Miia Valkonen, Maija Serlo, Minna Bäcklund, Johanna Hästbacka, Anni Pulkkinen, Tuomas Selander, Suvi T Vaara, Nina Inkinenet al.",2022 Dec 22,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36550559/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Fluid bolus therapy is a common intervention to improve urine output. Data concerning the effect of a fluid bolus on oliguria originate mainly from observational studies and remain controversial regarding the actual benefit of such therapy. We compared the effect of a follow-up approach without fluid bolus to a 500 mL fluid bolus on urine output in hemodynamically stable critically ill patients with oliguria at least for 2 h (urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/h) in randomized setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We randomized 130 patients in 1:1 fashion to receive either (1) non-interventional follow-up (FU) for 2 h or (2) 500 mL crystalloid fluid bolus (FB) administered over 30 min. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who doubled their urine output, defined as 2-h urine output post-randomization divided by urine output 2 h pre-randomization. The outcomes were adjusted for the stratification variables (presence of sepsis or AKI) using two-tailed regression. Obtained odds ratios were converted to risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The between-group difference in the continuous variables was compared using mean or median regression and expressed with 95% CIs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Altogether 10 (15.9%) of 63 patients in the FU group and 22 (32.8%) of 67 patients in FB group doubled their urine output during the 2-h period, RR (95% CI) 0.49 (0.23-0.71), P = 0.026. Median [IQR] change in individual urine output 2 h post-randomization compared to 2 h pre-randomization was - 7 [- 19 to 17] mL in the FU group and 19[0-53] mL in the FB group, median difference (95% CI) - 23 (- 36 to - 10) mL, P = 0.001. Median [IQR] duration of oliguria in the FU group was 4 [2-8] h and in the FB group 2 [0-6] h, median difference (95%CI) 2 (0-4) h, P = 0.038. Median [IQR] cumulative fluid balance on study day was lower in the FU group compared to FB group, 678 [518-1029] mL versus 1071 [822-1505] mL, respectively, median difference (95%CI) - 387 (- 635 to - 213) mL, P < 0.001.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Follow-up approach to oliguria compared to administering a fluid bolus of 500 mL crystalloid in oliguric patients improved urine output less frequently but lead to lower cumulative fluid balance. Trial registration clinical.

Preliminary clinical study of the effect of ascorbic acid on colistin-associated nephrotoxicity.,"Rujipas Sirijatuphat, Samornrod Limmahakhun, Vorapan Sirivatanauksorn, Roger L Nation, Jian Li, Visanu Thamlikitkul, Rujipas Sirijatuphatet al.",2015,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25801556/,No keywords found,"Nephrotoxicity is a dose-limiting factor of colistin, a last-line therapy for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. An earlier animal study revealed a protective effect of ascorbic acid against colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. The present randomized controlled study was conducted in 28 patients and aimed to investigate the potential nephroprotective effect of intravenous ascorbic acid (2 g every 12 h) against colistin-associated nephrotoxicity in patients requiring intravenous colistin. Thirteen patients received colistin plus ascorbic acid, whereas 15 received colistin alone. Nephrotoxicity was defined by the RIFLE classification system. Additionally, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) were measured as markers of renal damage, and plasma colistin concentrations were quantified. The baseline characteristics, clinical features, and concomitant treatments of the patients in the two groups were comparable. The incidences of nephrotoxicity were 53.8% (7/13) and 60.0% (9/15) in the colistin-ascorbic acid group and the colistin group, respectively (P = 0.956; relative risk [RR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.47 to 1.72). In both groups, the urinary excretion rates of NGAL and NAG on day 3 or 5 of colistin treatment and at the end of colistin treatment were significantly higher than those at the respective baselines (P < 0.05). However, the urinary excretion rates of these biomarkers at the various times during colistin treatment did not differ significantly between the groups (P > 0.05). The plasma colistin concentrations in the two groups were not significantly different (P > 0.28). The clinical and microbiological outcomes and mortality of the patients in the two groups were not significantly different. This preliminary study suggests that ascorbic acid does not offer a nephroprotective effect for patients receiving intravenous colistin.

Combination Therapy Use and Associated Events in Clinical Practice Following Dissemination of Trial Findings: A De-Implementation Study Using Interrupted Time Series Analysis.,"Heather M Campbell, Allison E Murata, Adam M Henrie, Todd A Conner, Heather M Campbellet al.",2024 Jan,Clin Ther,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37953077/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      It takes 17 years, on average, for trial results to be implemented into practice. Using data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), this study assessed the potential impact on clinical practice of the dissemination of findings from a randomized, controlled trial reporting harm with the use of combination therapy. Communication between research and VA Pharmacy Benefits Management Services (PBM) provided the impetus for communication from the PBM about the findings of the trial in accordance with policy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this de-implementation study, interrupted time series analysis was used for assessing prescribing patterns and adverse clinical events before and after the dissemination of the trial findings. The de-implementation strategy was multicomponent and multilevel. Strategies were aligned with categories outlined in the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change: train and educate stakeholders, use evaluative and iterative strategies, develop stakeholder inter-relationships, change infrastructure, provide interactive assistance, and engage consumers. VA patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease stages 1 to 3, and a moderate or severe albuminuria who received care between July 2008 and November 2017 were included. Patients were subgrouped according to treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor + angiotensin receptor blocker. The primary end point was the prevalence of combination therapy use. Secondary end points were the incidences of acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      This study followed 712,245 patients, 9297 of whom used combination therapy. Data were available from 428,535 and 283,710 patients pre- and post-intervention, respectively; among these, 8324 and 973 patients used combination therapy, the median ages were 66 and 68 years, and 96.92% and 98.82% were men. One month following communication from the PBM, the reductions in combination therapy users, acute kidney injury events, and hyperkalemia were 331.94 (95% CI, 500.27-163.32), 36.58% (95% CI, 31.90%-41.95%), and 25.49% (95% CI, 14.17%-36.07%) per 100,000 patients per month, respectively (all, P < 0.001), whereas before the communication, these changes were +14.84 (95% CI, 10.27-19.42), -3.46% (95% CI, 3.18-3.74), and -3.27% (95% CI, 2.66%-3.87%) (all, P < 0.001).
    


          Implications:
        
      
      The apparent speed and impact of the implementation of changes resulting from the dissemination of trial findings into VA clinical practice are encouraging. The speed of implementation was much faster than average for health care providers in the United States. Established communications between research and clinical practice, as well as established policy and communications between PBM and clinical practice, may be a model for other health care organizations."
A phase 2 trial of single low doses of rasburicase for treatment of hyperuricemia in adult patients with acute leukemia.,"Pankit Vachhani, Jeffrey Baron, Craig W Freyer, Austin Miller, Meir Wetzler, James E Thompson, Elizabeth A Griffiths, Eunice S Wang, Pankit Vachhaniet al.",2021 Aug:107:106588.,Leuk Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33957371/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Rasburicase can markedly and rapidly decrease uric acid (UA) levels, thereby preventing and treating tumor lysis syndrome. However, rasburicase is expensive, especially when used as per the manufacturer's recommended dosage of 0.2 mg/kg/day for up to 5 days. Numerous reports have shown that lower, and even single doses are effective in lowering UA levels but prospective randomized studies comparing low doses have not been performed.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To prospectively determine the efficacy and safety of two single low doses of rasburicase in adult patients (pts) with acute leukemia and elevated plasma UA.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eligible pts aged ≥ 18 years old with acute leukemia and UA ≥ 7.5 mg/dL were randomized to receive an initial single dose of rasburicase 1.5 mg (Arm A) or 3 mg (Arm B) on day 1 in an unblinded fashion. All pts received allopurinol 300 mg daily on days 1-6.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-four pts (median age 69 years; 14 males and 10 females) were enrolled in this phase 2 study (12 on each arm). Twenty pts had acute myeloid leukemia while 3 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1 had acute promyelocytic leukemia. Median initial UA level was 9.8 mg/dL. Eighty-three percent of pts in both arms achieved UA < 7.5 mg/dL by 24 h after therapy. Five pts (21 %; 2 from Arm A and 3 from Arm B) required additional doses of rasburicase. The majority (23/24) of pts achieved UA goals after 1-2 doses of rasburicase. None had worsening renal function. Both doses were well tolerated, and no treatment related adverse events were reported.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Single doses of rasburicase (as low as 1.5-3 mg) used in addition to allopurinol were well tolerated and highly efficacious (83 % response rate) in decreasing UA levels within 24 h of administration in adult acute leukemia pts with hyperuricemia."

      Treating to a lower blood pressure (BP) may increase acute kidney injury (AKI) events.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Data for AKI resulting in or during hospitalization or emergency department visits were collected as part of the serious adverse events reporting process of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).
    


          Setting & participants:
        
      
      9,361 participants 50 years or older with 1 or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants were randomly assigned to a systolic BP target of <120 (intensive arm) or <140mmHg (standard arm).
    


          Outcomes & measurements:
        
      
      Primary outcome was the number of adjudicated AKI events. Secondary outcomes included severity of AKI and degree of recovery of kidney function after an AKI event. Baseline creatinine concentration was defined as the most recent SPRINT outpatient creatinine value before the date of the AKI event.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 179 participants with AKI events in the intensive arm and 109 in the standard arm (3.8% vs 2.3%; HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.30-2.10; P<0.001). Of 288 participants with an AKI event, 248 (86.1%) had a single AKI event during the trial. Based on modified KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria for severity of AKI, the number of AKI events in the intensive versus standard arm by KDIGO stage was 128 (58.5%) versus 81 (62.8%) for AKI stage 1, 42 (19.2%) versus 18 (14.0%) for AKI stage 2, and 42 (19.2%) versus 25 (19.4%) for AKI stage 3 (P=0.5). For participants with sufficient data, complete or partial resolution of AKI was seen for 169 (90.4%) and 9 (4.8%) of 187 AKI events in the intensive arm and 86 (86.9%) and 4 (4.0%) of 99 AKI events in the standard arm, respectively.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Trial results are not generalizable to patients with diabetes mellitus or without risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      More intensive BP lowering resulted in more frequent episodes of AKI. Most cases were mild and most participants had complete recovery of kidney function.

Simplified Citrate Anticoagulation for CRRT Without Calcium Replacement.,"Marcus Broman, Bengt Klarin, Karin Sandin, Ola Carlsson, Anders Wieslander, Jan Sternby, Gabriela Godaly, Marcus Bromanet al.",2015 Jul-Aug,ASAIO J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25851312/,No keywords found,"Since 2012, citrate anticoagulation is the recommended anticoagulation strategy for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The main drawback using citrate as anticoagulant compared with heparin is the need for calcium replacement and the rigorous control of calcium levels. This study investigated the possibility to achieve anticoagulation while eliminating the need for calcium replacement. This was successfully achieved by including citrate and calcium in all CRRT solutions. Thereby the total calcium concentration was kept constant throughout the extracorporeal circuit, whereas the ionized calcium was kept at low levels enough to avoid clotting. Being a completely new concept, only five patients with acute renal failure were included in a short, prospective, intensely supervised nonrandomized pilot study. Systemic electrolyte levels and acid-base parameters were stable and remained within physiologic levels. Ionized calcium levels declined slightly initially but stabilized at 1.1 mmol/L. Plasma citrate concentrations stabilized at approximately 0.6 mmol/L. All postfilter ionized calcium levels were <0.5 mmol/L, that is, an anticoagulation effect was reached. All filter pressures were normal indicating no clotting problems, and no visible clotting was observed. No calcium replacement was needed. This pilot study suggests that it is possible to perform regional citrate anticoagulation without the need for separate calcium infusion during CRRT."
Effects of CYP3A5 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of a once-daily modified-release tacrolimus formulation and acute kidney injury in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Takaya Yamashita, Naohito Fujishima, Masatomo Miura, Takenori Niioka, Maiko Abumiya, Yoshinori Shinohara, Kumi Ubukawa, Miho Nara, Masumi Fujishima, Yoshihiro Kameoka, Hiroyuki Tagawa, Makoto Hirokawa, Naoto Takahashi, Takaya Yamashitaet al.",2016 Jul,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27217047/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Tacrolimus is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 3A5. We investigated the influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism and concurrent use of azole antifungal agents (AZ) on the pharmacokinetics of a once-daily modified-release tacrolimus formulation (Tac-QD) in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
    


          Design and methods:
        
      
      Twenty-four patients receiving allogeneic HSCT were enrolled. Genotyping for CYP3A5*3 was done by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Trough blood concentrations (C0) of tacrolimus were measured by chemiluminescence magnetic microparticle immunoassay. Continuous infusion of tacrolimus was administered from the day before transplantation and was switched to Tac-QD after adequate oral intake.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirteen patients had a CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype, and 11 patients had a CYP3A5*1/*1 or *1/*3 genotype. No significant difference was observed in daily dosages and the C0 of tacrolimus between the two genotype groups without AZ. However, in patients who were co-administered AZ, the C0 values of tacrolimus were higher in patients with the CYP3A5*3/*3 allele than with the CYP3A5*1 allele (P = 0.034), although daily doses of Tac-QD in patients with CYP3A5*3/*3 were significantly lower than those with the CYP3A5*1 allele (P = 0.041). The cumulative incidence of acute kidney injury was higher in patients with the CYP3A5*3/*3 than with the CYP3A5*1 allele when AZ was co-administered. The decrement for daily dosage of Tac-QD was significantly greater in patients expressing the CYP3A5*3/*3 than the CYP3A5*1 allele.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      CYP3A5 genotyping may be useful for safe and effective immunosuppressive therapy with Tac-QD in HSCT patients in whom the use of AZ is anticipated."
Effect of Aminophylline in Preventing Renal Dysfunction among Neonates with Prenatal Asphyxia: A Clinical Trial.,"Maryam Saboute, Javad Balasi, Saleheh Tajalli, Mahmoud Hajipour, Shaghayegh Heshmat, Nasrin Khalesi, Leila Allahqoli, Maryam Sabouteet al.",2020 May 1,Arch Iran Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32383615/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      As there are different views on the effects of aminophylline on neonatal renal function, we intended to observe the effects of aminophylline on renal dysfunction in neonates with prenatal asphyxia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This randomized trial was conducted in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from June 2016 to May 2017, in neonates with moderate to severe asphyxia during birth. Fifty-six neonates were divided randomly into two groups. The intervention group received one dose of 5mg/kg slow intravenous aminophylline injection and the placebo group received 2 mL/kg of intravenous 10% solution of dextrose saline during the first hour of life. They were monitored and compared for renal functional indices, electrolytes, and complications of asphyxia during the three days of life.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean of Cr (37.9 ± 8.8 vs 38.5 ± 9.4 and 20.8 ± 4.8 vs 30.1 ± 5.2 μmol/L), GFR (21.55 ± 4.7 vs 20.25 ± 4.4 and 30.8 ± 7.1 vs 20.1 ± 6.5 mL/minute/1.73 m2), Na (135.1 ± 12.4 vs134.5 ± 11.2 and 128.9 ± 11.5 vs 134.2 ± 10.9 mEq/L), and urine output (98.2 ± 25 vs 96.8 ± 23 and 148.7 ± 35 vs 108.8 ± 20 cc) were in the aminophylline treated and placebo group on the 1st and 3rd days, respectively. The mean difference of Cr (-9.3 (-8.9; -9.7) μmol/L); (P = 0.02), GFR (10.7 (10.1; 11.3) mL/minute/1.73 m2) (P = 0.009), Na (-5.3 (-5.9; -4.7) mEq/L) (P = 0.002), and urine volume (39.9 (24.9; 54.9) cc) (P = 0.001) presented statistically significant differences on the third day between the intervention and placebo group.

High-Dose Antibiotic Cement Spacers Independently Increase the Risk of Acute Kidney Injury in Revision for Periprosthetic Joint Infection: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.,"Michael M Valenzuela, Susan M Odum, William L Griffin, Bryan D Springer, Thomas K Fehring, Jesse E Otero, Michael M Valenzuelaet al.",2022 Jun,J Arthroplasty,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35210153/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Standard treatment for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) involves 2-stage exchange with placement of an antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer (ACS). Conflicting evidence exists on the role of ACS in development of acute kidney injury (AKI) after first-stage surgery. In this randomized clinical trial, we aimed to compare the incidence of AKI between the first-stage of a planned 2-stage exchange vs 1-stage exchange. This study design isolates the effect of the ACS in otherwise identical treatment groups.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The primary outcome variable was AKI, defined as a creatinine ≥1.5 times baseline or an increase of ≥0.3 mg/dL. Risk factors for AKI were evaluated using bivariate statistical tests and multivariable logistic regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients who underwent the first stage of a planned 2-stage exchange were significantly more likely to develop AKI compared with the 1-stage exchange group (15 [22.7%] vs 4 [6.6%], P = .011). On multivariable regression analysis, ACS placement (odds ratio 7.48, 95% confidence limit 1.77-31.56) and chronic kidney disease (odds ratio 3.84, 95% confidence limit 1.22-12.08) were independent risk factors for AKI.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our study provides evidence that high-dose antibiotic cement spacers for treatment of PJI are an independent risk factor for AKI. Therefore, efforts to minimize nephrotoxicity should be employed in revision for PJI when possible."
Long-term safety of withholding standard prophylaxis in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease.,"E C Nijssen, P J Nelemans, R J Rennenberg, G V van Ommen, J E Wildberger, E C Nijssenet al.",2023 Jan,Eur Radiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35763097/,"Acute kidney injury, Chronic kidney disease, Clinical practice guidelines, Contrast media, Prophylaxis.","In the latest ESUR contrast media guidelines, standard prophylaxis is no longer recommended for patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the absence of solid evidence, guideline updates are often based on indirect evidence and expert opinion. Likewise, evidence supporting the withdrawal of standard prophylaxis in moderate CKD patients was scarce and mostly indirect, but did include one randomised controlled trial evaluating guideline-recommended standard prophylactic intravenous hydration against a group receiving no prophylaxis (A MAastricht Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Guideline (AMACING) trial). Since then, benefits of the updated guideline recommendation for patient and hospital burden have been numerated and were shown to be substantial. The current special report provides data on long-term safety from the AMACING randomised controlled trial. KEY POINTS: • In the latest version of ESUR clinical practice guidelines for safe use of contrast media, standard prophylaxis is no longer recommended for patients with moderate chronic kidney disease. • Benefits of this change in recommendations for patient and hospital burden have been numerated. The current report provides data on long-term safety from the AMACING randomised controlled trial. • No disadvantage of withholding prophylaxis could be discerned. Results suggest that, in this population, underlying disease is more relevant for survival and prognosis than contrast administration itself."

          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed, previously treated (two or more lines of therapy) ES SCLC were enrolled into two cohorts. Cohort 1 received 0.3 mg/kg Rova-T (once every 6 wk for two cycles) plus 360 mg nivolumab (two 3-wk cycles beginning on week 4). Cohort 2 received the same dosage of Rova-T as cohort 1 plus 1 mg/kg nivolumab (four 3-wk cycles) and 1 mg/kg ipilimumab (beginning week 4). Both cohorts received 480 mg nivolumab every 4 weeks starting at week 10. Key objectives were to evaluate safety and tolerability and efficacy (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1). The response-related results are based on centrally read data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 42 patients received therapy: cohort 1, n = 30; cohort 2, n = 12. Overall, 43% received two or more previous lines of therapy. All patients experienced one or more treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE); 41 patients reported AEs considered related to the study drug by the investigator. The most frequent TEAE was pleural effusion (n = 20, 48%); most common grade greater than or equal to 3 was anemia (n = 9, 21%). Three grade 5 TEAEs considered related to the study drug were reported (cohort 1): pneumonitis (n = 2), acute kidney injury (n = 1). The objective response rate was 30% (12 of 40): cohort 1, 27.6% (8 of 29); cohort 2, 36.4% (4 of 11); all partial responses.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite encouraging antitumor activity in previously treated ES SCLC, combination therapy with Rova-T and nivolumab plus or minus ipilimumab was not well tolerated at the dose levels and administration schedules evaluated."
"Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of pradefovir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection.","Hong Zhang, Min Wu, Xiaoxue Zhu, Cuiyun Li, Xiaojiao Li, Weili Jin, Dengke Zhang, Hong Chen, Chengjiao Liu, Yanhua Ding, Junqi Niu, Jingrui Liu, Hong Zhanget al.",2020 Feb:174:104693.,Antiviral Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838002/,No keywords found,"Background & aims:
        
      
      Pradefovir is a liver targeted novel prodrug of adefovir (PMEA) developed to provide higher antiviral activity with reduced systemic toxicities. This study evaluated the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of pradefovir in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus infection.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve subjects with CHB were divided into five groups (10 patients each) and randomized within each group in a ratio of 6:2:2 to receive an ascending dose of 30, 60, 75, 90, or 120 mg pradefovir, 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), or 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) once a day for 28 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 51 subjects were randomized and 49 subjects completed the study. The groups were well matched and included 39 males, of whom 71% were hepatitis B e-antigen-negative with a mean hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level of 6.4-7.16 log10 IU/mL. No subject experienced a serious adverse event or nephrotoxicity. The most frequently reported adverse event was asymptomatic reduction in blood cholinesterase levels in the pradefovir group which recovered without any treatment about 13 ± 7 days after drug discontinuation. This adverse event was not observed in the ADV and TDF groups. The mean changes in serum HBV DNA were -2.78, -2.77, -3.08, -3.18, -3.44, -2.34, and -3.07 log10 IU/mL at 30, 60, 75, 90, and 120 mg pradefovir, 10 mg ADV and 300 mg TDF, respectively, with plateau levels reached with 60 mg pradefovir. Pradefovir and its metabolite PMEA showed linear pharmacokinetics proportional to the dose. The half-life of PMEA in the pradefovir group was 11.47-17.63 h.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Short-term use of pradefovir was well tolerated. A decline in HBV DNA levels was superior to TDF at higher doses of pradefovir. 30-60 mg pradefovir is recommended for CHB treatment.

Intensive Blood Pressure Control and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Elderly Patients: A Secondary Analysis of SPRINT Study Based on a 60-Year Age Cutoff.,"Manal F Cheema, Zeeshan Butt, Samreen Gilani, Sidra Shafiq, Shafiq Cheema, Manash K Das, Manal F Cheemaet al.",2023 Aug 5,Am J Hypertens,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37105717/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      In the original SPRINT article, age was categorized at 75 years, which was contrary to many previous clinical trials which is at 60 years.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The SPRINT trial randomized 9,361 hypertensive patients to a target blood pressure of <120 vs. <140 mm Hg (intensive vs. standard treatment, respectively). Age was re-categorized as <60 and ≥60 years and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes and adverse events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Intensive treatment reduced primary outcome significantly in both <60 and ≥60 years of age subgroups with a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 36% and 22%, respectively, and HR of 0.58 [95% CI, 0.36-0.94] and 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65-0.93], respectively. Although the intensive treatment rendered no effect on myocardial infarction (MI) in the overall comparison, it significantly reduced MI in patients <60 years of age with an RRR of 58% and HR of 0.39 [95% CI, 0.17-0.91]. In the ≥60-year age subgroup, reduced heart failure incidence was noted after intensive treatment, including death from other cardiovascular causes; however, these were not observed in the <60-year age subgroup. Intensive treatment resulted in significant hypotension, syncope, acute renal failure, or acute kidney injury in the ≥60-year age group; conversely, the risk of these adverse effects in patients <60 years of age did not increase.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intensive blood pressure control is beneficial for elderly patients (age ≥60 years), albeit with increased risk of adverse events."
Impact of Isolyte Versus 0.9% Saline on Postoperative Event of Acute Kidney Injury Assayed by Urinary [TIMP-2] [IGFBP7] in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.,"Nathan M Lee, Lev Deriy, Timothy R Petersen, Vallabh O Shah, Michael P Hutchens, Neal S Gerstein, Nathan M Leeet al.",2019 Feb,J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30181085/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      Administration of excess chloride in 0.9% normal saline (NS) decreases renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate, thereby increasing the risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). In this study, the effect of NS versus Isolyte use during cardiac surgery on urinary levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] and postoperative risk of AKI were examined.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Prospective, randomized, and single-blinded trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Single university medical center.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Thirty patients over 18 years without chronic renal insufficiency or recent AKI undergoing elective cardiac surgery.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Subjects were randomized to receive either NS or Isolyte during the intraoperative period.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      The primary outcome was the change in urinary levels of [TIMP2] × [IGFBP7] from before surgery to 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included serum creatinine pre- and postoperatively at 24 and 48 hours, serum chloride pre- and postoperatively at 24 and 48 hours, need for dialysis prior to discharge, and arterial pH measured 24 hours postoperatively. Sixteen patients received NS and 14 patients received Isolyte. Three patients developed AKI within the first 3 postoperative days, all in the NS group. The authors found increases in [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] in both groups. However, the difference in this increase between study arms was not significant (p = 0.92; -0.097 to 0.107).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The authors observed no change in urinary [TIMP-] × [IGFBP7] levels in patients receiving NS versus Isolyte during cardiac surgery. Future larger studies in patients at higher risk for AKI are recommended to evaluate the impact of high- versus lower-chloride solutions on the risk of postoperative AKI after cardiac surgery."

      Based on the randomised Euro-EWING99-R1 trial, vincristine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) may be able to replace vincristine, adriamycin, ifosfamide (VAI) in the treatment of standard-risk Ewing sarcoma. However some heterogeneity of treatment effect by gender was observed. The current exploratory study aimed at investigating the influence of gender on treatment efficacy and acute toxicity.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Impact of gender on event-free survival (EFS), acute toxicity by course, switches between treatment arms and cumulative dose of alkylating agents was evaluated in multivariable models adjusted for age including terms to test for heterogeneity of treatment effect by gender. The analysis of the EFS was performed on the intention-to-treat population.
    


          Results:
        
      
      EFS did not significantly differ between the 509 males and 347 females (p=0.33), but an interaction in terms of efficacy was suspected between treatment and gender (p=0.058): VAC was associated with poorer EFS than VAI in males, hazard ratio (HR) (VAC/VAI)=1.37 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98-1.90], contrasting with HR=0.81 [95%CI, 0.53-1.24] in females. Severe toxicity was more frequent in females, whatever the toxicity type. Thirty patients switched from VAI to VAC (9/251 males, 4%, and 21/174 females, 12%) mostly due to renal toxicity, and three from VAC to VAI (2/258 males, 0.8%, and 1/173 females, 0.6%). A reduction of alkylating agent cumulative dose >20% was more frequent in females (15% versus 9%, p=0.005), with no major difference between VAC and VAI (10% versus 13%, p=0.15).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Differences of acute toxicity rate and cumulative doses of alkylating agents could not explain the marginal interaction observed in the Euro-EWING99-R1 trial data. Effects of gender-dependent polymorphism/activity of metabolic enzymes (e.g. known for CYP2B6) of ifosfamide versus cyclophosphamide should be explored. External data are required to further evaluate whether there is heterogeneity of alkylating agent effect by gender.

"Intravenous magnesium sulfate for prevention of vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam induced acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: An open-label, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.","Hossein Khalili, Hamid Rahmani, Mostafa Mohammadi, Mohamadreza Salehi, Zahra Mostafavi, Hossein Khaliliet al.",2021 Dec,Daru,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34463929/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Recent studies have shown an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam (VPT) combination. In this study, the efficacy of intravenous magnesium sulfate in prevention of VPT induced AKI in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU has been evaluated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In an open-label, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, 72 adults (≥ 18 years old) who had indications to receive VPT as empiric therapy were assigned to the magnesium or control group in 1:1 ratio. Concomitant with VPT, intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate was started for patients in the magnesium group. The target serum level of magnesium was defined 3 mg/dl. Patients in the control group received normal saline as placebo. The target serum level of magnesium was defined 1.9 mg/dl in this group. The study's primary outcome was incidence of AKI during and up to 48 h after the treatment course. Escalation and de-escalation of VPT regimen, duration of hospitalization, length of ICU stay and 28-day mortality were secondary outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty patients in each group completed the examination. Five patients in the magnesium group and 11 patients in the control group experienced AKI (p = 0.072). De-escalation of VPT regimen was done approximately in 60% of patients. Duration of hospitalization and length of ICU stay were not statistically different between the groups. Finally, 28-day mortality was 23.33% in each group. Although the incidence of AKI was not statistically different between the groups in unadjusted logistic regression model, it became significant after adjusting for confounding factors [unadjusted model (OR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.10-1.16, p = 0.084), adjusted model: (OR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.07-0.96, p = 0.04)].
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Administration of magnesium sulfate with the target serum levels around 3 mg/dL reduced the incidence of AKI in critically ill patients who were receiving VPT as empric therapy."
"Is the use of hydroxyethyl starch as priming solution during cardiac surgery advisable? A randomized, single-center trial.","Øyvind S Svendsen, Marit Farstad, Arve Mongstad, Rune Haaverstad, Paul Husby, Venny L Kvalheim, Øyvind S Svendsenet al.",2018 Sep,Perfusion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29199540/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      The use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) leads to increased fluid filtration and edema. The use of artificial colloids to counteract fluid extravasation during cardiac surgery is controversial. Beneficial effects on global fluid loading, leading to better cardiac performance and hemodynamics, have been claimed. However, renal function and coagulation may be adversely affected, with unfavorable impact on outcome following cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Forty patients were randomly allocated to study groups receiving either acetated Ringer's solution (CT group) or hydroxyethyl starch (HES group, Tetraspan®) as CPB priming solution. Fluid balance, bleeding and hemodynamics, including cardiac output, were followed postoperatively. The occurrence of acute kidney injury was closely registered.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two patients were excluded from further analyzes due to surgical complications. Fluid accumulation was attenuated in the HES group (3374 (883) ml) compared with the CT group (4328 (1469) ml) (p=0.024). The reduced perioperative fluid accumulation was accompanied by an increased cardiac index immediately after surgery (2.7 (0.4) L/min/m2 in the HES group and 2.1 (0.3) L/min/m2 in the CT group (p<0.001)). No increase in bleeding could be demonstrated in the HES group. Three patients, all of them in the HES group, experienced acute kidney injury postoperatively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      CPB priming with HES solution lowers fluid loading during bypass and improves cardiac function in the early postoperative period. The manifestation of acute kidney injury exclusively in the HES group of patients raises doubts about the use of HES products in conjunction with cardiac surgery.

Acute Kidney Function Declines in the Context of Decongestion in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure.,"Wendy McCallum, Hocine Tighiouart, Jeffrey M Testani, Matthew Griffin, Marvin A Konstam, James E Udelson, Mark J Sarnak, Wendy McCallumet al.",2020 Jul,JACC Heart Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32535124/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      This study aimed to examine whether incorporation of a comprehensive set of measures of decongestion modifies the association of acute declines in kidney function with outcomes.
    


          Background:
        
      
      In-hospital acute declines in kidney function occur in approximately 20% to 30% of patients admitted with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and may be associated with adverse outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using data from EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan), we used multivariable Cox regression models to evaluate the association between in-hospital changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with death and a composite outcome of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. We evaluated eGFR declines within the context of changes in markers of volume overload including b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and weight, as well as changes in measures of hemoconcentration including hematocrit, albumin, and total protein.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 3,715 patients over a median follow-up of 9.9 months, every 30% decline in eGFR was associated with higher risk of both death (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 1.31) and the composite outcome (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.18) in adjusted models. The acute decline in eGFR was no longer associated with higher risk of either outcome as long as there was evidence of decongestion, either by declines in BNP, NT-proBNP, or weight or by increases in hematocrit, albumin or total protein. Interaction testing between decline in eGFR and changes in hematocrit, albumin, and total protein was statistically significant (p interaction of <0.01 for death and p interaction of ≤0.01 for composite for all 3 biomarkers). Interaction between change in eGFR and changes in BNP (p interaction = 0.07 for death; p interaction = 0.08 for composite), NT-proBNP (p interaction = 0.15 for death; p interaction = 0.18 for composite) and weight (p interaction = 0.13 for death; p interaction = 0.19 for composite) did not meet statistical significance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, acute declines in eGFR are associated with adverse outcomes, with evidence of modification by changes in markers of decongestion, suggesting that they are no longer associated with adverse outcomes if these markers are concomitantly improving."
"Effect of atorvastatin on the incidence of acute kidney injury following valvular heart surgery: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Jin Ha Park, Jae-Kwang Shim, Jong-Wook Song, Sarah Soh, Young-Lan Kwak, Jin Ha Parket al.",2016 Sep,Intensive Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27120082/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have the potential to reduce acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery through their pleiotropic properties. Here we studied the preventive effect of atorvastatin on AKI after valvular heart surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two-hundred statin-naïve patients were randomly allocated to receive either statin or placebo. Atorvastatin was administered orally to the statin group according to a dosage schedule (80 mg single dose on the evening prior to surgery; 40 mg on the morning of surgery; three further doses of 40 mg on the evenings of postoperative days 0, 1, and 2). AKI incidence was assessed during the first 48 postoperative hours on the basis of Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of AKI was similar in the statin and control groups (21 vs. 26 %, respectively, p = 0.404). Biomarkers of renal injury including plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and interleukin-18 were also similar between the groups. The statin group required significantly less norepinephrine and vasopressin during surgery, and fewer patients in the statin group required vasopressin. There were no significant differences in postoperative outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Acute perioperative statin treatment was not associated with a lower incidence of AKI or improved clinical outcome in patients undergoing valvular heart surgery. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01909739)."

Course 1 filgrastim/pegfilgrastim was permitted after initial DLT determination, if neutropenia was dose limiting. Seventeen patients received 59 courses. Without filgrastim (n=9), DLT was neutropenia in 2 patients at dose level 1. No DLT was observed after adding filgrastim (n=8). There was no ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity >grade 1, or neurotoxicity >grade 2. One patient experienced a partial response and 9 had stable disease after 2 courses. In conclusion, the IOE regimen was well tolerated. Without filgrastim, neutropenia was dose limiting with MTD at ifosfamide 1200 mg/m/d and etoposide 75 mg/m/d. The MTD with filgrastim was not defined due to early study closure. Filgrastim allowed ifosfamide and etoposide dose escalation and should be included in future studies."
Impact of Rosuvastatin on contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients at high risk for nephropathy undergoing elective angiography.,"Okay Abaci, Alev Arat Ozkan, Cuneyt Kocas, Gokhan Cetinkal, Osman Sukru Karaca, Onur Baydar, Aysem Kaya, Tevfik Gurmen, Okay Abaciet al.",2015 Apr 1,Am J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25670636/,No keywords found,"Although statins have been shown to prevent contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients with acute coronary syndromes, the benefit of statins is not known for patients at high risk for nephropathy who undergo elective coronary angiography. Two hundred twenty consecutive statin-naive patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) who underwent elective coronary or peripheral angiography were randomly assigned to receive rosuvastatin (40 mg on admission, followed by 20 mg/day; n = 110) or no statin treatment (control group, n = 110). Contrast-induced acute kidney injury was defined by an absolute increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.5 mg/dl or a relative increase of ≥25% measured 48 or 72 hours after the procedure. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury occurred in 15 patients (7.2%), 9 (8.5%) in the control group and 6 (5.8%) in the rosuvastatin group (p = 0.44). The incidences of adverse cardiovascular and renal events (death, dialysis, myocardial infarction, stroke, or persistent renal damage) were similar between the two groups at follow-up.

Putative novel mediators of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: handling by continuous venovenous hemofiltration and effect of anticoagulation modalities.,"Louise Schilder, S Azam Nurmohamed, Pieter M ter Wee, Nanne J Paauw, Armand R J Girbes, Albertus Beishuizen, Robert H J Beelen, A B Johan Groeneveld, Louise Schilderet al.",2015 Oct 30:16:178.,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26519056/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Novel putative mediators of acute kidney injury (AKI) include immune-cell derived tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and protein pentraxin-3 (PTX3). The effect of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and different anticoagulation regimens on plasma levels were studied.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      At 0, 10, 60, 180 and 720 min of CVVH, samples were collected from pre- and postfilter blood and ultrafiltrate. No anticoagulation (n = 13), unfractionated heparin (n = 8) or trisodium citrate (n = 21) were compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Concentrations of TWEAK, Ang-2 and PTX3 were hardly affected by CVVH since the mediators were not (TWEAK, PTX3) or hardly (Ang-2) detectable in ultrafiltrate, indicating negligible clearance by the filter in spite of molecular sizes (TWEAK, PTX3) at or below the cutoff of the membrane. Heparin use, however, was associated with an increase in in- and outlet plasma TWEAK.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Novel AKI mediators are not cleared nor produced by CVVH. However, heparin anticoagulation increased TWEAK levels in patient's plasma whereas citrate did not, favouring the latter as anticoagulant in CVVH for AKI."

      Preclinical studies demonstrate renal proximal tubular injury after administration of some intravenous iron preparations but clinical data on renal effects of intravenous iron are sparse.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      FIND-CKD was a 56-week, randomized, open-label, multicenter study in which patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD), anemia and iron deficiency without erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy received intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), targeting either higher (400-600 μg/L) or lower (100-200 μg/L) ferritin values, or oral iron.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean (SD) eGFR at baseline was 34.9 (11.3), 32.8 (10.8) and 34.2 (12.3) mL/min/1.73 m2 in the high ferritin FCM (n = 97), low ferritin FCM (n = 89) and oral iron (n = 167) groups, respectively. Corresponding values at month 12 were 35.6 (13.8), 32.1 (12.7) and 33.4 (14.5) mL/min/1.73 m2. The pre-specified endpoint of mean (SE) change in eGFR from baseline to month 12 was +0.7 (0.9) mL/min/1.73 m2 with high ferritin FCM (p = 0.15 versus oral iron), -0.9 (0.9) mL/min/1.73 m2 with low ferritin FCM (p = 0.99 versus oral iron) and -0.9 (0.7) mL/min/1.73 m2 with oral iron. No significant association was detected between quartiles of FCM dose, change in ferritin or change in TSAT versus change in eGFR. Dialysis initiation was similar between groups. Renal adverse events were rare, with no indication of between-group differences.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Intravenous FCM at doses that maintained ferritin levels of 100-200 μg/L or 400-600 μg/L did not negatively impact renal function (eGFR) in patients with ND-CKD over 12 months versus oral iron, and eGFR remained stable. These findings show no evidence of renal toxicity following intravenous FCM over a 1-year period.

Preclinical data demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile and preserved or improved antitumor activity compared with cisplatin across animal models. We evaluated the safety and tolerability of NC-6004 and gemcitabine using a Bayesian continual reassessment model (N-CRM) to determine the optimal dose.Experimental Design: Patients with advanced solid tumors received NC-6004 at 60 to 180 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine at 1,250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Dose escalation of NC-6004 began with a single patient run-in until a dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 180 mg/m2 Cohorts of four patients were enrolled at doses predicted by the N-CRM. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as having the greatest probability of target toxicity <25%. Quality of life was assessed using EORTC-QLQ-C30.Results: Among 22 patients, the most common grade III/IV hematologic adverse events were leukopenia (68%) and thrombocytopenia (59%). Of 20 pretreated patients evaluable for response, half were previously exposed to a platinum agent. The MTD was 135 mg/m2 Nine patients were treated at the MTD with median treatment duration of 15 weeks (range, 3-50). Tumor shrinkage occurred in 11 (55%), partial responses in 3 (15%), and stable disease in 14 (70%). Most patients reported stable or improved EORTC QLQ-C30 scores.Conclusions: Greater cisplatin equivalent doses were achieved with no clinically significant neuro-, oto-, or nephrotoxicity.

Role of aminophylline in prevention of acute kidney injury in term neonates with severe perinatal asphyxia: a randomized open-label controlled trial.,"Dinesh Munian, Sukanta Dutta, Arindam Ghosh, Ripan Saha, Dinesh Munianet al.",2024 Oct 4,J Trop Pediatr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39390900/,No keywords found,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the frequently observed complications in neonates with severe perinatal asphyxia. The efficacy of aminophylline in preventing or alleviating renal dysfunction in these neonates remains controversial. The current study aimed to explore whether treatment with aminophylline as adjunctive therapy is superior to standard care alone in preventing AKI in severely asphyxiated term neonates and to delineate the changes in other renal parameters. In this open-label randomized clinical trial, term neonates with severe asphyxia (n = 41) received a 5 mg/kg intravenous dose of aminophylline within the first hour after birth, in addition to standard care for birth asphyxia. The control group (n = 40) received standard care alone. Their daily urine output, weight, serum creatinine, renal functional status, and complications during the first 5 days of life were monitored and compared. The statistical package for social sciences version 25 was used for analysis. Approximately 24.39% of neonates in the aminophylline group developed AKI, compared to 35.0% in the control group (P = .088). Although urine output was generally higher in aminophylline-treated newborns than in the control group, this increase was not statistically significant (P > .05), with the most notable differences observed on the second and third postnatal days. Also, the changes in plasma creatinine levels between the two groups during this time were not statistically significant. Administering a single dose of aminophylline (5 mg/kg) within the first hour of life to severely asphyxiated term neonates might temporarily enhance urine output, but does not reduce the overall incidence of AKI."
"Saline versus balanced crystalloids for intravenous fluid therapy in the emergency department: study protocol for a cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial.","Wesley H Self, Matthew W Semler, Jonathan P Wanderer, Jesse M Ehrenfeld, Daniel W Byrne, Li Wang, Leanne Atchison, Matthew Felbinger, Ian D Jones, Stephan Russ, Andrew D Shaw, Gordon R Bernard, Todd W Rice, Wesley H Selfet al.",2017 Apr 13,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28407811/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Prior studies in critically ill patients suggest the supra-physiologic chloride concentration of 0.9% (""normal"") saline may be associated with higher risk of renal failure and death compared to physiologically balanced crystalloids. However, the comparative effects of 0.9% saline and balanced fluids are largely unexamined among patients outside the intensive care unit, who represent the vast majority of patients treated with intravenous fluids.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      This study, entitled Saline Against Lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte in the Emergency Department (SALT-ED), is a pragmatic, cluster, multiple-crossover trial at a single institution evaluating clinical outcomes of adults treated with 0.9% saline versus balanced crystalloids for intravenous fluid resuscitation in the emergency department. All adults treated in the study emergency department receiving at least 500 mL of isotonic crystalloid solution during usual clinical care and subsequently hospitalized outside the intensive care unit are included. Treatment allocation of 0.9% saline versus balanced crystalloids is assigned by calendar month, with study patients treated during the same month assigned to the same fluid type. The first month (January 2016) was randomly assigned to balanced crystalloids, with each subsequent month alternating between 0.9% saline and balanced crystalloids. For balanced crystalloid treatment, clinicians can choose either Lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte A©. The study period is set at 16 months, which will result in an anticipated estimated sample size of 15,000 patients. The primary outcome is hospital-free days to day 28, defined as the number of days alive and out of the hospital from the index emergency department visit until 28 days later. Major secondary outcomes include proportion of patients who develop acute kidney injury by creatinine measurements; major adverse kidney events by hospital discharge or day 30 (MAKE30), which is a composite outcome of death, new renal replacement therapy, and persistent creatinine elevation >200% of baseline; and in-hospital mortality.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This ongoing pragmatic trial will provide the most comprehensive evaluation to date of clinical outcomes associated with 0.9% saline compared to physiologically balanced fluids in patients outside the intensive care unit.

A phase 1b dose-escalation study of carfilzomib in combination with thalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory systemic immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis.,"Sriram Ravichandran, Andrew Hall, Matthew Jenner, Mamta Garg, Bhuvan Kishore, Helen Lachmann, Julian Gillmore, Alexandra Pitchford, Jamie B Oughton, Shameem Mahmood, Sajitha Sachchithantham, Philip Hawkins, Sarah Brown, Ashutosh Wechalekar, Sriram Ravichandranet al.",2023 Sep,Amyloid,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37216268/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Proteasome inhibitors are the backbone of AL amyloidosis treatment - bortezomib being most widely used. Carfilzomib is a proteasome inhibitor licenced to treat multiple myeloma; autonomic and peripheral neuropathy are uncommon toxicities with carfilzomib. There is limited data on the use of carfilzomib in AL amyloidosis. Here, we report the results of a phase Ib dose-escalation study of Carfilzomib-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (KTD) in relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial registered 11 patients from 6 UK centres from September 2017 to January 2019; 10 patients received at least one dose of trial treatment. 80 adverse events were reported from 10 patients in the 1st three cycles. One patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity (acute kidney injury) at a dose of 45 mg/m2, and another patient had a SAR (fever). Five patients experienced an AE ≥ grade 3. There were no haematologic, infectious, or cardiac AE ≥ grade 3. The overall haematological response rate (ORR) at the end of three cycles of treatment was 60%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Carfilzomib 45 mg/m2 weekly can be safely given with thalidomide and dexamethasone. The efficacy and tolerability profile appears comparable to other agents in relapsed AL amyloidosis. These data provide a framework for further studies of carfilzomib combinations in AL amyloidosis."
Protocol of a randomised controlled trial in cardiac surgical patients with endothelial dysfunction aimed to prevent postoperative acute kidney injury by administering nitric oxide gas.,"Francesco Marrazzo, Stefano Spina, Francesco Zadek, Tenzing Lama, Changhan Xu, Grant Larson, Emanuele Rezoagli, Rajeev Malhotra, Hui Zheng, Edward A Bittner, Kenneth Shelton, Serguei Melnitchouk, Nathalie Roy, Thoralf M Sundt, William D Riley, Purris Williams, Daniel Fisher, Robert M Kacmarek, Taylor B Thompson, Joseph Bonventre, Warren Zapol, Fumito Ichinose, Lorenzo Berra, Francesco Marrazzoet al.",2019 Jul 4,BMJ Open,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31278097/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in cardiac surgery. Levels of intravascular haemolysis are strongly associated with postoperative AKI and with prolonged (>90 min) use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Ferrous plasma haemoglobin released into the circulation acts as a scavenger of nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial cells. Consequently, the vascular bioavailability of NO is reduced, leading to vasoconstriction and impaired renal function. In patients with cardiovascular risk factors, the endothelium is dysfunctional and cannot replenish the NO deficit. A previous clinical study in young cardiac surgical patients with rheumatic fever, without evidence of endothelial dysfunction, showed that supplementation of NO gas decreases AKI by converting ferrous plasma haemoglobin to ferric methaemoglobin, thus preserving vascular NO. In this current trial, we hypothesised that 24 hours administration of NO gas will reduce AKI following CPB in patients with endothelial dysfunction.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a single-centre, randomised (1:1) controlled, parallel-arm superiority trial that includes patients with endothelial dysfunction, stable kidney function and who are undergoing cardiac surgery procedures with an expected CPB duration >90 min. After randomisation, 80 parts per million (ppm) NO (intervention group) or 80 ppm nitrogen (N2, control group) are added to the gas mixture. Test gases (N2 or NO) are delivered during CPB and for 24 hours after surgery. The primary study outcome is the occurrence of AKI among study groups. Key secondary outcomes include AKI severity, occurrence of renal replacement therapy, major adverse kidney events at 6 weeks after surgery and mortality. We are recruiting 250 patients, allowing detection of a 35% AKI relative risk reduction, assuming a two-sided error of 0.05.

      It has been shown that, in contrast to other inotropic agents, levosimendan improves glomerular filtration rate after adult cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of levosimendan, compared with milrinone, in preventing acute kidney dysfunction in infants after open-heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Two-center, double-blinded, prospective, randomized clinical trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      The study was performed in two tertiary pediatric centers, one in Sweden (Gothenburg) and one in Finland (Helsinki).
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Infants between 1 and 12 months old, diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot, complete atrioventricular septal defect or nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect, undergoing total corrective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Seventy-two infants were randomized to receive a perioperative infusion of levosimendan (0.1 µg/kg/min) or milrinone (0.4 µg/kg/min). The infusion was initiated at the start of cardiopulmonary bypass and continued for 26 hours.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      The primary outcome variable was the absolute value of serum creatinine data on postoperative day 1. Secondary outcomes included the following: 1) acute kidney injury according to the serum creatinine criteria of the Kidney Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes; 2) acute kidney injury with serum creatinine corrected for fluid balance; 3) plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin; 4) cystatin C; 5) urea; 6) lactate; 7) hemodynamic variables; 8) use of diuretics in the PICU; 9) need of dialysis; 10) length of ventilator therapy; and 11) length of PICU stays. There was no significant difference in postoperative serum creatinine between the treatment groups over time (p = 0.65). The occurrence rate of acute kidney injury within 48 hours was 46.9% in the levosimendan group and 39.5% in the milrinone group (p = 0.70). There were no significant differences in other secondary outcome variables between the groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Levosimendan compared with milrinone did not reduce the occurrence rate of acute kidney injury in infants after total corrective heart surgery for atrioventricular septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or Tetralogy of Fallot."

      To evaluate the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on renal function and medical costs in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with cardiac surgery.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The Japanese trial for AKI in Post-cardiovascular surgery patients by ANP (JAPAN) was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 11 hospitals in Japan. Acute kidney injury was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours. The patients were randomly assigned to receive ANP (0.02 μg kg-1 min-1) or placebo. The primary end point was a change in renal function. The secondary end points were a need for renal replacement therapy, the lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and medical costs incurred over the 90-day follow-up.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 77 randomized patients, 37 were in the ANP group and 40 were in the placebo group. Although ANP significantly (P = .018) increased urine output, it did not significantly improve renal function compared with placebo. There were no significant differences between the groups in the renal replacement therapy rate, the lengths of the intensive care unit and hospital stays, or medical costs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Atrial natriuretic peptide infusion did not show a renoprotective effect or cost-saving effect in the treatment of cardiac surgery-associated AKI."

Both kidneys were harvested on day 6; histopathology was described and scored and smooth muscle actin was quantified with histomorphometry. A 2-way ANOVA was used to compare time and treatment. Chi square analysis was used to determine the % of cats with at least International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) Grade 1 AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Time, but not treatment, had a significant effect on renal function. No difference was noted in % of cats with IRIS AKI. Significantly fewer mitotic figures were observed in ischemic kidneys that received bone-marrow derived MSCs vs. fibroblasts. No differences in smooth muscle actin staining were noted.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study did not support the use of allogeneic MSCs in AKI in the regimen described here. Type of renal injury, MSC dose, allogenicity, duration, and route or timing of administration could influence the efficacy MSCs."
Tacrolimus combined with corticosteroids versus Modified Ponticelli regimen in treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy: Randomized control trial.,"Raja Ramachandran, Harsha Kumar Hn, Vinod Kumar, Ritambhra Nada, Ashok Kumar Yadav, Ajay Goyal, Vivek Kumar, Manish Rathi, Vivekanand Jha, Krishan Lal Gupta, Vinay Sakhuja, Harbir Singh Kohli, Raja Ramachandranet al.",2016 Feb,Nephrology (Carlton),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26205759/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      There have been very few studies comparing cyclophosphamide (CTX) and calcineurin inhibitor based regimens in the management of non-immunosuppressive symptomatic therapy (NIST) resistant idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN). The present study was aimed at comparing the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus (TAC)/steroids with cyclical CTX/steroids (Modified Ponticelli regimen (MPR)) in patients with IMN.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Idiopathic membranous nephropathy patients (n = 70) with persistent nephrotic syndrome after at least 6 months of antiproteinuric therapy or with complications of nephrotic syndrome were equally randomized to receive TAC with oral prednisolone (TAC*) or MPR. Antibodies against m-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R Ab) were tested for at baseline and, at 6 and 12 months after the start of therapy. The primary end point was achievement of remission and secondary objectives were adverse effects and estimated glomerular filtration rate in both the study groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Intention-to-treat analysis showed that remissions at the end of 6 (74% with TAC* vs. 60% with MPR; P = 0.30) and 12 months (71% with TAC* vs. 77% with MPR; P = 0.78) were comparable. PLA2R Ab titres at 6/12 months correlated with urine protein (r 0.54/0.58) and serum albumin (r -0.49/-0.53) at the end of therapy. Patients on CTX had a significantly higher risk of amenorrhea and while those on TAC had a greater risk of reversible nephrotoxicity.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In NIST refractory IMN, both TAC* and MPR are comparable, but with different adverse effect profile. PLA2 R Ab has a very good association with proteinuria, and should be regularly monitored on clinical follow-up."
Utility of Urinary Biomarkers in Predicting Loss of Residual Renal Function: The balANZ Trial.,"Yeoungjee Cho, David W Johnson, David A Vesey, Carmel M Hawley, Margaret Clarke, Nicholas Topley                              ;, balANZ Trial Investigators, G Rangan, L Liew, H Kulkarni, U Steinwandel, B Jones, L Garvey, John Hunter, M G Suranyi, M Gilbert, F G Brown, I Abraham, J Nandkumar, A Coburn, V Bali, S McDonald, S Frasca, M Hockley, C Russ, T J Elias, K Bannister, K Pirone, D Ranganathan, L Williams, K Warr, G Smith, N Boudville, S Pellicano, R Langham, E O'Flaherty, J Schollum, L Reed, L Anderson, D Voss, B Jagannathan, P Nicholls, M W Y Foo, C K Tam, R Lee, Tang Tock Seng, S H Tan, Yeoungjee Choet al.",2015 Mar-Apr,Perit Dial Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24711637/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The ability of urinary biomarkers to predict residual renal function (RRF) decline in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients has not been defined. The present study aimed to explore the utility of established biomarkers from kidney injury models for predicting loss of RRF in incident PD patients, and to evaluate the impact on RRF of using neutral-pH PD solution low in glucose degradation products.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study included 50 randomly selected participants from the balANZ trial who had completed 24 months of follow-up. A change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was used as the primary clinical outcome measure. In a mixed-effects general linear model, baseline measurements of 18 novel urinary biomarkers and albumin were used to predict GFR change. The model was further used to evaluate the impact of biocompatible PD solution on RRF, adjusted for each biomarker.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline albuminuria was not a useful predictor of change in RRF in PD patients (p = 0.84). Only clusterin was a significant predictor of GFR decline in the whole population (p = 0.04, adjusted for baseline GFR and albuminuria). However, the relationship was no longer apparent when albuminuria was removed from the model (p = 0.31). When the effect of the administered PD solutions was examined using a model adjusted for PD solution type, baseline albuminuria, and GFR, higher baseline urinary concentrations of trefoil factor 3 (TFF3, p = 0.02), kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1, p = 0.04), and interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10, p = 0.03) were associated with more rapid decline of RRF in patients receiving conventional PD solution compared with biocompatible PD solution.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Higher urinary levels of kidney injury biomarkers (TFF3, KIM-1, IP-10) at baseline predicted significantly slower RRF decline in patients receiving biocompatible PD solutions. Findings from the present investigation should help to guide future studies to validate the utility of urinary biomarkers as tools to predict RRF decline in PD patients."

      This phase I/II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of streptozocin (STZ) in Japanese patients with unresectable or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-two patients received up to 4 cycles of intravenous STZ at either 500 mg/m2 once daily for 5 consecutive days every 6 weeks (daily regimen) or at 1000-1500 mg/m2 once weekly for 6 weeks (weekly regimen). Tumor response was evaluated using the modified RECIST criteria ver. 1.1, and adverse events were assessed by grade according to the National Cancer Institute CTCAE (ver. 4.0).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fourteen (63.6%) patients completed the study protocol. No patients had complete response; partial response in 2 (9.1%), stable disease in 17 (77.3%), non-complete response/non-progressive disease in 2 (9.1%) and only 1 (4.5%) had non-evaluable disease. Excluding the latter, the response rate in the daily and weekly regimens was 6.7% (1/15) and 16.7% (1/6), respectively, with an overall response rate of 9.5% (2/21). However, the best overall response in each patient showed that the disease control rate was 100%.Adverse events occurred in all 22 patients, including 17 grade 3 adverse events in 11 patients; however, no grade 4 or 5 adverse events were reported. Prophylactic hydration and antiemetic treatment reduced the severity and incidence of nephrotoxicity, nausea and vomiting. Plasma STZ concentrations decreased rapidly after termination of infusion, with a half-life of 32-40 min. Neither repeated administration nor dose increases affected pharmacokinetic parameters.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      STZ may be a useful option for Japanese patients with unresectable or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors."
Biweekly Carboplatin Plus Gemcitabine as First-Line Treatment of Elderly Patients With Advanced Squamous Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer: A Multicenter Phase I-II Trial by the Hellenic Oncology Research Group.,"Athanasios Karampeazis, Lambros Vamvakas, Nikolaos Kentepozidis, Aris Polyzos, Vassilis Chandrinos, Georgios Rigas, Charalambos Christofyllakis, Athanasios Kotsakis, Dora Hatzidaki, Athanasios G Pallis, Vassilis Georgoulias, Athanasios Karampeaziset al.",2016 Nov,Clin Lung Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27397849/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The present study was a phase I/II study to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) and dose-limiting toxicities of the biweekly carboplatin/gemcitabine combination and evaluate its safety and efficacy in patients aged ≥ 70 years with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Patients aged ≥ 70 years with advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC received escalated doses of carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] 2-2.5 intravenously) and gemcitabine (800-1100 mg/m2 intravenously) every 2 weeks (phase I). In the phase II, the drugs were administered at their previously defined MTDs (carboplatin, AUC 2.5; gemcitabine, 1100 mg/m2). The primary endpoint was the overall response rate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 69 patients were enrolled (phase I, n = 15). The median age was 76 years (range, 70-84 years); 52 patients had stage IV disease, and 61 and 8 patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 and 2, respectively. The MTDs could not be reached at the predefined last dose levels. The dose-limiting toxicities were grade 5 renal toxicity and grade 3 thrombocytopenia. In the phase II study, the overall response rate was 35.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.0%-48.8%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median progression-free survival was 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.2-8.8 months), and the median overall survival was 13.3 months (95% CI, 7.1-19.6 months). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in 7 patients (12.3%), grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 4 patients (7.1%), and grade 2 or 3 fatigue in 10 patients (17.5%). One toxic death occurred in the phase I of the study.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The biweekly regimen of gemcitabine and carboplatin showed satisfactory efficacy and a favorable toxicity profile in elderly patients with advanced or metastatic squamous cell NSCLC."
Study protocol for the Balanced Solution versus Saline in Intensive Care Study (BaSICS): a factorial randomised trial.,"Fernando G Zampieri, Luciano C P Azevedo, Thiago D Corrêa, Maicon Falavigna, Flavia R Machado, Murillo S C de Assunção, Suzana M A Lobo, Letícia K Dourado, Otavio Berwanger, John A Kellum, Nilton Brandão, Alexandre B Cavalcanti                              ;, BaSICS Investigators and the BRICNet, Fernando G Zampieriet al.",2017 Jun,Crit Care Resusc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28651514/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The effectiveness and safety of balanced crystalloid fluids compared with saline (0.9% sodium chloride) as a fluid of choice in critically ill patients remain unclear. The effects of different fluid infusion rates on outcomes are also unknown.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To test the hypothesis that a balanced crystalloid solution, compared with saline, decreases 90-day all-cause mortality among critically ill patients; and to test the hypothesis that slow, compared with rapid, infusion rate decreases 90-day mortality in this population of patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Balanced Solution versus Saline in Intensive Care Study (BaSICS) is a pragmatic, 2 ??2 factorial, randomised controlled trial. A total of 11 000 patients will be recruited from at least 100 Brazilian intensive care units. Patients will be randomised to receive Plasma-Lyte 148 or saline, and to rapid infusion (999 mL/h) or slow infusion (333 mL/h). Study fluids will be used for resuscitation episodes (at rapid or slow infusion rates), dilution of compatible medications and maintenance solutions. Patients, health care providers and investigators will be blinded to the solutions being tested. The rate of bolus infusion will not be blinded.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      The primary outcome is 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes are: incidence of renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy within 90 days, incidence of acute kidney injury (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stages 2 and 3), incidence of non-renal organ dysfunction assessed by Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score at Days 3 and 7, and number of mechanical ventilationfree days within the first 28 days after randomisation.
    


          Results and conclusions:
        
      
      The BaSICS trial will provide robust evidence on whether a balanced crystalloid, compared with saline, improves important patient outcomes in critically ill patients. BaSICS will also provide relevant information on whether bolus infusion rate affects outcomes in this population.

"A study of axitinib, a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in children and adolescents with recurrent or refractory solid tumors: A Children's Oncology Group phase 1 and pilot consortium trial (ADVL1315).","James I Geller, Elizabeth Fox, Brian K Turpin, Stuart L Goldstein, Xiaowei Liu, Charles G Minard, Rachel A Kudgus, Joel M Reid, Stacey L Berg, Brenda J Weigel, James I Gelleret al.",2018 Dec 1,Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30394521/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Axitinib is an oral small molecule that inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 to 3. A phase 1 and pharmacokinetic (PK) trial evaluating axitinib was conducted in children with refractory solid tumors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Axitinib was administered orally twice daily in continuous 28-day cycles. Dose levels (2.4 mg/m2 /dose and 3.2 mg/m2 /dose) were evaluated using a rolling 6 design. Serial PKs (cycle 1, days 1 and 8) and exploratory biomarkers were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 19 patients were enrolled; 1 patient was ineligible due to inadequate time having elapsed from prior therapy. The median age of the patients was 13.5 years (range, 5-17 years). Two of 5 patients who were treated at dose level 2 experienced dose-limiting toxicities (palmar-plantar erythryodysesthesia syndrome in 1 patient and intratumoral hemorrhage in 1 patient). Frequent (>20%) grade 1 to 2 toxicities during cycle 1 included anemia, anorexia, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, and hypertension. Nonhematological toxicities of grade ≥3 in subsequent cycles included hypertension and elevated serum lipase. PK analysis demonstrated variability in axitinib exposure, the median time to peak plasma concentration was 2 hours, and the half-life ranged from 0.7 to 5.2 hours. Exposure and dose were not found to be significantly associated with hypertension. Five patients achieved stable disease for ≤6 cycles as their best response, including patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (1 patient), Ewing sarcoma (1 patient), hepatocellular carcinoma (1 patient), and osteosarcoma (2 patients). One patient with alveolar soft part sarcoma achieved a partial response. Kidney injury biomarkers were found to be elevated at baseline; no trends were identified.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In children with refractory solid tumors, the maximum tolerated and recommended dose of axitinib appears to be 2.4 mg/m2 /dose, which provides PK exposures similar to those of adults."
Remote ischemic preconditioning to reduce contrast-induced acute kidney injury in chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial.,"Ali Ghaemian, Jamshid Yazdani, Soheil Azizi, Ali A Farsavian, Maryam Nabati, Alireza Malekrah, Mozhdeh Dabirian, Fatemeh Espahbodi, Bahareh Mirjani, Hossein Mohsenipouya, Javad Heshmatian, Ali Ghaemianet al.",2018 Dec 22,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30577785/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The impact of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) on patients with chronic renal disease is well-known. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a non-invasive method that can reduce the risk of CI-AKI, but studies on RIPC have had different results. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential impact of RIPC on CI-AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial, 132 patients with chronic renal dysfunction (glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/m2) who underwent coronary angiography or angioplasty received adequate hydration. RIPC was performed in 66 patients by applying an upper arm blood pressure cuff. The cuff was inflated four times for 5 min to 50 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure, followed by deflation for 5 min. In the control group, the blood pressure cuff was inflated only to 10 mmHg below the patient's diastolic blood pressure. The primary endpoint was an increase in serum cystatin C ≥ 10% from baseline to 48-72 h after exposure to the contrast.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The primary endpoint was achieved in 48 (36.4%) patients (24 in each group). RIPC did not show any significant effect on the occurrence of the primary endpoint (P = 1). In addition, when the results were analyzed based on the Mehran risk score for subgroups of patients, RIPC did not reduce the occurrence of the primary endpoint (P = 0.97).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients at moderate-to-high risk of developing CI-AKI when an adequate hydration protocol is performed, RIPC does not have an additive effect to prevent the occurrence of CI-AKI.

      The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate remains at 50% for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LAHNSCC), thereby underscoring the need for improved treatments. An antidiabetic agent, metformin, was found in retrospective studies to improve survival in patients with HNSCC. Therefore, the authors conducted a phase 1 dose escalation study combining metformin with chemoradiotherapy in patients with LAHNSCC.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Nondiabetic patients with LAHNSCC were enrolled in the current study to receive escalating doses of metformin and CRT based on the modified toxicity probability interval design. Metformin cohort doses included 2000 mg, 2550 mg, and 3000 mg daily in divided doses in addition to cisplatin (at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22, and 43) and standard radiotherapy (70 grays). Adverse events were categorized as per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty patients were enrolled, 2 of whom withdrew consent. The median age of the patients was 56 years and the majority were male (83%), were white (88%), had p16-positive disease (72%), and were tobacco users (61%). The median length of metformin exposure was 28.5 days. The most common grade ≥3 toxicities were nausea (11%), vomiting (11%), mucositis (6%), acute kidney injury (17%), anemia (6%), and leukopenia (11%). Dose-limiting toxicities included diarrhea and acute kidney injury. After a median follow-up of 19 months, the 2-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 90% and 84%, respectively. No hypoglycemia events or lactic acidosis were observed. Cisplatin administration did not appear to affect metformin pharmacokinetics. The maximum tolerated dose for metformin could not be determined given the limited number of patients who tolerated metformin during chemoradiotherapy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first phase 1 trial combining metformin with chemoradiotherapy. Rates of overall survival and progression-free survival were encouraging in this limited patient population, and warrant further investigation in a phase 2 trial."

      Following the treatment with aminophylline, NGAL levels in asphyxiated neonates are likely to reduce. Further studies based on other kidney dysfunction parameters can lead to the better and accurate conclusions."
Effect of high-dose sodium selenite in cardiac surgery patients: A randomized controlled bi-center trial.,"Tanja Schmidt, Hans Pargger, Esther Seeberger, Friedemann Eckhart, Stefanie von Felten, Christoph Haberthür, Tanja Schmidtet al.",2018 Aug,Clin Nutr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28502744/,No keywords found,"Background & aims:
        
      
      Cardiac surgery is accompanied by oxidative stress and systemic inflammatory response, which may be associated with organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Selenium and selenoenzymes are important constituents of anti-oxidative defense. We hypothesized that high-dose sodium selenite supplementation can attenuate the postoperative inflammation and might, therefore, improve clinical outcome.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, bi-center study on 411 adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients received an intravenous bolus of 4000 μg selenium (in the form of sodium selenite) or placebo after induction of anesthesia and 1000 μg/d selenium or placebo during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Primary outcome measure was the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on the second postoperative day. Secondary endpoints included the change in perioperative selenium levels, change of inflammatory and cardiac markers, use of vasoactive medication, incidence of acute kidney injury, ICU and hospital length of stay, and mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The perioperative administration of high-dose sodium selenite prevented the postoperative drop of blood and serum selenium levels, reduced the number of patients depending on postoperative vasoactive support but failed to reduce the postoperative SOFA score and its related organ-specific scores compared to placebo. Except for an increase of postoperative procalcitonin and bilirubin levels in the sodium selenite group, other inflammatory markers, organ function variables and clinical endpoints remained unchanged.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The perioperative administration of high-dose sodium selenite in cardiac surgery patients prevented the postoperative fall of blood selenium levels and reduced the need for postoperative vasoactive support by a yet unknown mechanism.

Effects of probucol on contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Yong Wang, Yun Shi, Xuesheng Xu, Wenkun Ge, Shuo Yang, Chengzhi Lu, Yong Wanget al.",2019 Jun,Medicine (Baltimore),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31232940/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      This study was performed to explore the effects of probucol on contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) in patients with coronary heart disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In total, 220 patients undergoing PCI were randomly assigned to either the control group (hydration from 12 hours before to 12 hours after contrast administration; n = 110) or the probucol group (hydration plus probucol 500 mg twice daily 1 day before and 3 days after the operation; n = 110). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of serum creatinine (Scr)-based CIAKI, defined as an absolute increase in Scr by 0.5 mg/dl (44.2 μmol/L) or a relative 25% increase from baseline within 48 to 72 hours after exposure to contrast medium. The secondary outcomes were composite variations in Scr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine clearance rate (Ccr) within 48 to 72 hours, and major adverse events during hospitalization or the 7-day follow-up period after PCI.

      The overall incidence of Scr-based CIAKI was 7.3% (16/220): 5.5% (6/110) in the control group and 9.1% (10/110) in the probucol group (χ = 1.078, P = .298). There were no significant differences in the occurrence rate of major adverse events during hospitalization or the 7-day follow-up period after PCI between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that probucol was not an independent protective factor for CIAKI (odds ratio, 1.825; 95% confidence interval, 0.639-5.212; P = .261). However, hydration was an independent protective factor (odds ratio, 0.997; 95% confidence interval, 0.995-0.999; P = .004).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Probucol cannot effectively reduce the incidence of CIAKI through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effects."
Bioimpedance-Guided Hydration for the Prevention of Contrast-Induced Kidney Injury: The HYDRA Study.,"Mauro Maioli, Anna Toso, Mario Leoncini, Nicola Musilli, Gabriele Grippo, Claudio Ronco, Peter A McCullough, Francesco Bellandi, Mauro Maioliet al.",2018 Jun 26,J Am Coll Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29929610/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intravascular volume expansion plays a major role in the prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). Recommended standard amounts of fluid infusion before procedures do not produce homogeneous responses in subjects with different initial hydration status.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The goal of this study was to compare the effect of standard and double intravenous (IV) infusion volumes in patients with low body fluid level, assessed by using bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA), on the incidence of CI-AKI after elective coronary angiographic procedures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 303 patients with low BIVA level on admission were randomized to receive standard volume saline (1 ml/kg/h for 12 h before and after the procedure) or double volume saline (2 ml/kg/h). Patients (n = 715) with an optimal BIVA level received standard volume saline and were included in a prospective registry. The saline infusion was halved in all patients with an ejection fraction <40%. BIVA was repeated immediately before the angiographic procedure in all patients. CI-AKI was defined as an increase in levels of cystatin C ≥10% above baseline at 24 h after contrast administration.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of CI-AKI was significantly lower (11.5% vs. 22.3%; p = 0.015) in patients receiving double volume saline than in those receiving standard volume saline, respectively. Before the angiographic procedure, 50% of the double volume patients achieved the optimal BIVA level compared with only 27.7% in the standard group (p = 0.0001). The findings were consistent in all the pre-specified subgroups excluding patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction <40% (p for interaction = 0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Evaluation of BIVA levels on admission in patients with stable coronary artery disease allows adjustment of intravascular volume expansion, resulting in lower CI-AKI occurrence after angiographic procedures.

Comparison of efficacy of oral paracetamol versus ibuprofen for PDA closure in preterms - a prospective randomized clinical trial.,"Bharathi Balachander, Nivedita Mondal, Vishnu Bhat, Bethou Adhisivam, Mahesh Kumar, Santhosh Satheesh, Mahalakshmi Thulasingam, Bharathi Balachanderet al.",2020 May,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30227731/,"Ductus, PDA, ibuprofen, paracetamol, preterm.","Background: Currently nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, ibuprofen and indomethacin, are approved drugs for closure of patent ductus arteriosus but have potential toxicities. There are reports of the effectiveness of paracetamol in ductal closure. However, there is paucity of data comparing paracetamol to ibuprofen or indomethacin in relation to the efficacy and safety profile.Methods: This randomized clinical trial was done in our tertiary care neonatal unit from October 2014 to January 2016 after clearance from ethical committee. It was registered with clinical trial registry of India (CTRI/2016/09/007261) and drug controller general of India (CT/Drugs/56/2014). Preterm neonates with clinical suspicion of hemodynamically significant PDA after echo confirmation were included in the study. Randomization was done by stratified randomization through sealed opaque envelopes. A sample size of 150 was estimated with an expected difference in success of closure as 20% between the treatment groups at level of 5% significance and 80% power. The echocardiography was done 24 hours after completion of treatment by a cardiologist blinded to treatment.Results: The baseline parameters were comparable between two groups. One hundred and forty-six babies had hs-PDA, out of which 110 babies were randomized. No significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to PDA closure (RR 0.97, 95%CI 0.78-1.20, p = 1), mortality or cardio-respiratory morbidity. The babies who received ibuprofen had a higher occurrence of acute kidney injury (RR 0.33, 95%CI 0.13-0.85, p = 0.024).Conclusions: Paracetamol is as effective as ibuprofen for PDA closure in preterm neonates. Ibuprofen used for PDA closure in preterms poses an increased risk for acute kidney injury compared to paracetamol."

      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a serious complication in patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention. We aimed to evaluate the preventive effects of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)-guided hydration for the prevention of CI-AKI in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing cardiac catheterization.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial enrolled 114 eligible patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 < eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [according to the level-modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula (MDRD)] and stable ischemic heart disease undergoing coronary procedures. The patients were randomly allocated 1:1 into the LVEDP-guided hydration group (n = 57) or the standard hydration group (n = 57). CI-AKI was defined as a greater than 25% or greater than 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 mmol/L) increase in the serum creatinine concentration compared with the baseline value. Hydration with 0.9% sodium chloride at a rate of 1 mL/kg/h (0.5 mL/kg/h if left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%) within 12 h was given to all the patients in both groups before the procedure. In the LVEDP-guided group, the hydration infusion rate was adjusted according to the LVEDP level during and after the procedure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of CI-AKI was 7.01% (4/57) in the LVEDP-guided group vs 3.84% (2/52) in the standard hydration group (summary odds ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.093-3.022; P = 0.463). Major adverse cardiac events, hemodialysis, or related deaths occurred in neither of the groups during hospitalization or the 30-day follow-up.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In the present study, LVEDP-guided fluid administration, by comparison with standard hydration, failed to offer protection against the risk of CI-AKI in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention."
Evaluation of the effectiveness of caspofungin against febrile neutropenia and the factors related to the alteration in its plasma concentration.,"Yuhei Shibata, Yuri Miyahara, Yuna Sadaka, Mika Yasue, Minami Fujimura, Midori Soda, Miho Yamamoto, Hiroko Kato, Akio Suzuki, Katsura Tsukamoto, Takeshi Hara, Hisashi Tsurumi, Kiyoyuki Kitaichi, Yuhei Shibataet al.",2019 Oct,J Infect Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31047782/,"Caspofungin, Febrile neutropenia, Japanese patients, Pharmacokinetics.","Caspofungin (CPFG) is an echinocandin antifungal agent that inhibits the synthesis of β-1, 3-D-glucan, a critical component of the cell wall of target fungi. Several clinical studies have confirmed the efficacy and safety of CPFG in patients with febrile neutropenia (FN); however, there are no reports available in Japanese patients with FN. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetics of CPFG as an empirical therapy in a Japanese hospital. Twenty-four Japanese patients, who were diagnosed with FN at Gifu University Hospital from February 2014 to August 2017, were enrolled. Blood samples were collected at the end of CPFG dosing (0.5 h after the infusion) on day 1 and immediately prior to the next infusion on days 2, 3, and 4. The concentration of CPFG in plasma was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The efficacy was assessed by five of the component endpoints, and safety was monitored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. CPFG showed an excellent effect against FN (75%, 18/24), without any serious hepatic or renal toxicity. Regarding the pharmacokinetics, the plasma concentration of CPFG was significantly correlated with body weight; although, no correlation was observed between the plasma concentration of CPFG and the other factors investigated, such as gender or laboratory results. These results suggest the high efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CPFG as an empirical antifungal therapy for Japanese patients with FN."
Comparison of postoperative ascites replacement strategies on time to first flatus after living donor liver transplantation: Albumin vs. lactated Ringer's solution.,"Seung-Young Oh, Hye-Young Woo, Leerang Lim, Hyunjae Im, Hannah Lee, Jeong-Moo Lee, Suk Kyun Hong, YoungRok Choi, Nam-Joon Yi, Kwang-Woong Lee, Kyung-Suk Suh, Ho Geol Ryu, Seung-Young Ohet al.",2024 Jan,Clin Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38289882/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      There is insufficient evidence regarding the optimal regimen for ascites replacement after living donor liver transplantation (LT) and its effectiveness. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of replacing postoperative ascites after LT with albumin on time to first flatus during recovery with early ambulation and incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Adult patients who underwent elective living donor LT at Seoul National University Hospital from 2019 to 2021 were randomly assigned to either the albumin group or lactated Ringer's group, based on the ascites replacement regimen. Replacement of postoperative ascites was performed for all patients every 4 h after LT until the patient was transferred to the general ward. Seventy percent of ascites drained during the previous 4 h was replaced over the next 4 h with continuous infusion of fluids with a prescribed regimen according to the assigned group. In the albumin group, 30% of a total of 70% of drained ascites was replaced with 5% albumin solution, and remnant 40% was replaced with lactated Ringer's solution. In the lactated Ringer's group, 70% of drained ascites was replaced with only lactated Ringer's solution. The primary outcome was the time to first flatus from the end of the LT and the secondary outcome was the incidence of AKI for up to postoperative day 7.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among the 157 patients who were screened for eligibility, 72 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 63 ± 8.2 years, and 73.0 % (46/63) were male. Time to first flatus was similar between the two groups (66.7 ± 24.1 h vs. 68.5 ± 25.6 h, p = .778). The albumin group showed a higher glomerular filtration rate and lower incidence of AKI until postoperative day 7, compared to the lactated Ringer's group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Using lactated Ringer's solution alone for replacement of ascites after living donor LT did not reduce the time to first flatus and was associated with an increased risk of AKI. Further research on the optimal ascites replacement regimen and the target serum albumin level which should be corrected after LT is required."
"Effect of perioperative sodium bicarbonate administration on renal function following cardiac surgery for infective endocarditis: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Jin Sun Cho, Sarah Soh, Jae-Kwang Shim, Sanghwa Kang, Haegi Choi, Young-Lan Kwak, Jin Sun Choet al.",2017 Jan 5,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28057030/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with infective endocarditis (IE) have an elevated risk of renal dysfunction because of extensive systemic inflammation and use of nephrotoxic antibiotics. In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we investigated whether perioperative sodium bicarbonate administration could attenuate postoperative renal dysfunction in patients with IE undergoing cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seventy patients randomly received sodium chloride (n = 35) or sodium bicarbonate (n = 35). Sodium bicarbonate was administered as a 0.5 mmol/kg loading dose for 1 h commencing with anesthetic induction, followed by a 0.15 mmol/kg/h infusion for 23 h. The primary outcome was peak serum creatinine (SCr) level during the first 48 h postoperatively. The incidence of acute kidney injury, SCr level, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and major morbidity endpoints were assessed postoperatively.
    


          Results:

          Control:
        
      
      1.01 (0.74, 1.37) mg/dl vs. 0.88 (0.76, 1.27) mg/dl, P = 0.474) and the incidence of acute kidney injury (bicarbonate vs.
    


          Control:
        
      
      29% vs. 23%, P = 0.584) were similar in both groups. The postoperative increase in SCr above baseline was greater in the bicarbonate group than in the control group on postoperative day 2 (0.21 (0.07, 0.33) mg/dl vs. 0.06 (0.00, 0.23) mg/dl, P = 0.028) and postoperative day 5 (0.23 (0.08, 0.36) mg/dl vs. 0.06 (0.00, 0.23) mg/dl, P = 0.017).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Perioperative sodium bicarbonate administration had no favorable impact on postoperative renal function and outcomes in patients with IE undergoing cardiac surgery. Instead, it was associated with possibly harmful renal effects, illustrated by a greater increase in SCr postoperatively, compared to control.

      This study was an open-label phase I study to confirm the safety and tolerability of NC-6004 in combination with gemcitabine in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors and to assess the PK effects of NC-6004 monotherapy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This phase I study used a 3 + 3 design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose of NC-6004 combined with gemcitabine. Safety and pharmacokinetics were assessed. The administration of NC-6004 alone was started at 60 mg/m2 every treatment cycle (21 days per cycle). From the second through eighth cycles, patients received NC-6004 in combination with 1000 mg/m2 of gemcitabine that was administered on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle, except for the first treatment cycle.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve patients with advanced solid tumors received 60 or 90 mg/m2 NC-6004. Both MTD and RD were determined to be 90 mg/m2. The most common drug-related adverse events were neutrophil decrease (66.7%) and white blood cell count decrease (41.7%). Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis revealed that NC-6004 PK profile in Japanese study was not significantly different from that in a previous Caucasian study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Both MTD and RD of NC-6004 were determined to be 90 mg/m2. The pharmacodynamic (PD) model well explained the time course of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and amplitude of decrease in eGFR. The decrease in eGFR appeared to reach saturation at >100 mg/m2 with NC-6004. Estimated probability of acute kidney injury on this PK/PD simulation was 30% with NC-6004 and 70% with cisplatin, which may better explain the renal toxicity profile."

      CSL112 (apolipoprotein A-I [human]) is a plasma-derived apolipoprotein A-I developed for early reduction of cardiovascular risk following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The safety of CSL112 among AMI subjects with moderate, stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      CSL112_2001, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized phase 2 trial, enrolled patients with moderate CKD within 7 days following AMI. Enrollment was stratified on the basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate and presence of diabetes requiring treatment. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 4 weekly infusions of CSL112 6 g or placebo. The co-primary safety end points were renal serious adverse events (SAEs) and acute kidney injury, defined as an increase ≥26.5 μmol/L in baseline serum creatinine for more than 24 hours, during the treatment period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 83 patients were randomized (55 CSL112 vs 28 placebo). No increase in renal SAEs was observed in the CSL112 group compared with placebo (CSL112 = 1 [1.9%], placebo = 4 [14.3%]). Similarly, no increase in acute kidney injury events was observed (CSL112 = 2 [4.0%], placebo = 4 [14.3%]). Rates of other SAEs were similar between groups. CSL112 administration resulted in increases in ApoA-I and cholesterol efflux similar to those observed in patients with AMI and normal renal function or stage 2 CKD enrolled in the ApoA-I Event Reducing in Ischemic Syndromes I trial.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results demonstrate the acceptable safety of the 6-g dose of CSL112 among AMI subjects with moderate stage 3 CKD and support inclusion of these patients in a phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial powered to assess efficacy."

          Measurement and main results:
        
      
      A total of 76 patients were randomized with the following characteristics (continuous venovenous hemofiltration-high cutoff vs continuous venovenous hemofiltration-standard); median age of 65 versus 70 year, percentage of males 47% versus 68%, and median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores of 25 versus 23.5. The median hours of norepinephrine-free time at day 7 were 32 (0-110.8) for continuous venovenous hemofiltration-high cutoff and 56 hours (0-109.3 hr) (p = 0.520) for continuous venovenous hemofiltration-standard. Inhospital mortality was 55.6% with continuous venovenous hemofiltration-high cutoff versus 34.2% with continuous venovenous hemofiltration-standard (adjusted odds ratio, 2.49; 95% CI, 0.81-7.66; p = 0.191). There was no significant difference in time to cessation of norepinephrine (p = 0.358), time to cessation of hemofiltration (p = 0.563), and filter life (p = 0.21). Serum albumin levels (p = 0.192) were similar and the median dose of IV albumin given was 90 grams (20-212 g) for continuous venovenous hemofiltration-high cutoff and 80 grams (15-132 g) for continuous venovenous hemofiltration-standard (p = 0.252).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In critically ill patients with acute kidney injury, continuous venovenous hemofiltration-high cutoff did not reduce the duration of vasopressor support or mortality or change albumin levels compared with continuous venovenous hemofiltration-standard."

Secondary outcomes included the development of severe acute kidney injury, time between cardiovascular ICU admission and first successful extubation, percent fluid overload, total fluid balance, urine output, bioelectrical impedance, and serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. The unadjusted rate and severity of acute kidney injury were not different between groups; 43 of 72 (60%) of the treatment group and 36 of 72 (50%) of the placebo group developed acute kidney injury (p = 0.32). Stage 2/3 acute kidney injury occurred in 23 of 72 (32%) of the treatment group and 15 of 72 (21%) of the placebo group (p = 0.18). Secondary outcome measures also demonstrated no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups. Aminophylline administration was safe; no deaths occurred in either group, and rates of adverse events were similar (14% in the treatment group vs 18% in the placebo group; p = 0.30).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, we found no effect of aminophylline to prevent acute kidney injury in children recovering from cardiac surgery performed with cardiopulmonary bypass. Future study of preoperative aminophylline administration to prevent acute kidney injury may be warranted."

This phase 1 study determined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the anti-CSF-1R antibody LY3022855 in solid tumors. Methods Patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy were enrolled and treated in 2 dosing cohorts: weight-based (part A) and non-weight-based (part B). Part A patients were assigned to intravenous (IV) dose-escalation cohorts: 2.5 mg/kg once per week (QW), 0.3 mg/kg QW, 0.6 mg/kg QW, 1.25 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 1.25 mg/kg QW doses of LY3022855. Non-weight-based doses in part B were 100 mg and 150 mg IV QW. Results Fifty-two patients (mean age 58.6 ± 10.4 years) were treated with ≥1 dose of LY3022855 (range: 4-6). Five dose-limiting toxicities (left ventricular dysfunction, anemia, pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury) occurred in 4 patients. The non-weight-based 100 mg QW dose was established as the RP2D. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were increase in liver function variables, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, pyrexia, increased lipase, amylase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Clearance decreased with increasing dose and weight-based dosing had minimal effect on pharmacokinetics. Serum CSF-1, and IL-34 levels increased at higher doses and more frequent dosing, whereas TAMs and CD14dimCD16bright levels decreased. Three patients achieved stable disease. No responses were seen. Conclusions LY3022855 was well tolerated and showed dose-dependent pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics and limited clinical activity in a heterogenous solid tumor population.

Goal-directed fluid therapy during post-resection phase in low central venous pressure assisted laparoscopic hepatectomy: a randomized controlled superiority trial.,"Shichao Li#, Yue Yin#, Pei Wang, Long Jiang, Huan Yan, Jing Cang, Shichao Liet al.",2024 Feb,J Anesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38091035/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this prospective single blinded randomized controlled trial was to find out whether goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) strategy in post-transection period in low central venous pressure (CVP) assisted laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) has more benefit than traditional fluid strategy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Between April 2020 and Dec 2021, patients who were scheduled for laparoscopic liver resection surgery were eligible to participate in the study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: control group that received traditional fluid strategy in post-transection period in low CVP assisted laparoscopic hepatectomy and GDFT strategy group that received GDFT strategy in post-transection period. The primary outcome parameter is the incidence of postoperative complications. Secondary outcome parameters include perioperative clinical outcomes, postoperative clinical outcomes, length of hospital stay after surgery, postoperative lactic acid, fluids and vasoactive medications during the operation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 159 patients in the control group and 160 patients in the GDFT were included. Two groups had no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications including pneumonia (P = 0.34), acute kidney injury (P = 0.72), hepatic insufficiency (P = 0.25), pleural effusion (P = 0.08) and seroperitoneum (P = 1.00), respectively. The amount of perioperative urine output is fewer in GDFT group than in the control group (P = 0.0354), while other perioperative variables and postoperative variables were comparable between two groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results show the implementation of GDFT strategy is not associated with fewer postoperative complications. GDFT strategy did not result in improved outcomes in low CVP-assisted laparoscopic hepatectomy."
A retrospective analysis to estimate target trough concentration of vancomycin for febrile neutropenia in patients with hematological malignancy.,"Yosuke Suzuki, Issei Tokimatsu, Yuko Morinaga, Yuhki Sato, Kuniko Takano, Kazuhiro Kohno, Masao Ogata, Kazufumi Hiramatsu, Hiroki Itoh, Jun-ichi Kadota, Yosuke Suzukiet al.",2015 Feb 2:440:183-7.,Clin Chim Acta,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25476135/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The target trough concentration of vancomycin in patients with febrile neutropenia has not been reported. The aim of this study was to estimate the target trough concentration for febrile neutropenia in patients with hematological malignancy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this retrospective, single-center, observational cohort study, 63 hospitalized patients with hematological malignancy who were treated with vancomycin for febrile neutropenia due to bacteriologically documented or presumptive Gram-positive infections were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A significant difference in the first trough concentration of vancomycin was observed between the response and non-response groups, and between the nephrotoxicity and non-nephrotoxicity groups. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified the first trough concentration as the only independent variable associated with clinical efficacy and nephrotoxicity of vancomycin. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.72 and 0.83 for clinical efficacy and nephrotoxicity, respectively. The cut-off values of the first trough concentration were 11.1 μg/ml for clinical efficacy (sensitivity 60%, specificity 87%) and 11.9 μg/ml for nephrotoxicity (sensitivity 77%, specificity 82%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results suggest a relationship of trough vancomycin concentration with clinical efficacy and incidence of nephrotoxicity. We propose a target trough vancomycin concentration of around 11.5 μg/ml for febrile neutropenia in patients with hematological malignancy."
"Evaluating the efficacy, safety and evolution of renal function with early initiation of everolimus-facilitated tacrolimus reduction in de novo liver transplant recipients: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.","Bjorn Nashan, Peter Schemmer, Felix Braun, Markus Dworak, Peter Wimmer, Hans Schlitt, Bjorn Nashanet al.",2015 Mar 26:16:118.,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25873064/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Introduction of calcineurin inhibitors had led to improved survival rates in liver transplant recipients. However, long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of chronic renal failure, neurotoxicity, de novo malignancies, recurrence of hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. Several studies have shown that everolimus has the potential to provide protection against viral replication, malignancy, and progression of fibrosis, as well as preventing nephrotoxicity by facilitating calcineurin inhibitor reduction without compromising efficacy. The Hephaistos study evaluates the beneficial effects of early initiation of everolimus in de novo liver transplant recipients.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      Hephaistos is an ongoing 12-month, multi-center, open-label, controlled study aiming to enroll 330 de novo liver transplant recipients from 15 centers across Germany. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio (7-21 days post-transplantation) to receive everolimus (trough levels 3-8 ng/mL) with reduced tacrolimus (trough levels <5 ng/mL), or standard tacrolimus (trough levels 6-10 ng/mL) after entering a run-in period (3-5 days post-transplantation). In the run-in period, patients are treated with induction therapy, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and corticosteroids according to local practice. Randomization is stratified by HCV status and model of end-stage liver disease scores at transplantation. The primary objective of the study is to exhibit superior renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate assessed by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)-4 formula) with everolimus plus reduced tacrolimus compared to standard tacrolimus at Month 12. Other objectives are: to assess the incidence of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death; the incidences of components of the composite efficacy endpoint; renal function via estimated glomerular filtration rate using various formulae (MDRD-4, Nankivell, Cockcroft-Gault, chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration and Hoek formulae); the incidence of proteinuria; the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events; the incidence and severity of cytomegalovirus and HCV infections and HCV-related fibrosis.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This study aims to demonstrate superior renal function, comparable efficacy, and safety in de novo liver transplant recipients receiving everolimus with reduced tacrolimus compared with standard tacrolimus. This study also evaluates the antiviral benefit by early initiation of everolimus.

Effect of periprocedural furosemide-induced diuresis with matched isotonic intravenous hydration in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Lisa Voigtländer-Buschmann, Sarina Schäfer, Christian Schmidt-Lauber, Jessica Weimann, Mina Shenas, Julian Giraldo Cortes, Piotr Mariusz Kuta, Tanja Zeller, Raphael Twerenbold, Moritz Seiffert, Niklas Schofer, Yvonne Schneeberger, Andreas Schäfer, Johannes Schirmer, Hermann Reichenspurner, Stefan Blankenberg, Lenard Conradi, Ulrich Schäfer, Lisa Voigtländer-Buschmannet al.",2024 Jun,Clin Res Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37264143/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a serious complication which is associated with increased mortality. The RenalGuard system was developed to reduce the risk of AKI after contrast media exposition by furosemide-induced diuresis with matched isotonic intravenous hydration. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the RenalGuard system on the occurrence of AKI after TAVI in patients with chronic kidney disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The present study is a single-center randomized trial including patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing TAVI. Overall, a total of 100 patients treated by TAVI between January 2017 and August 2018 were randomly assigned to a periprocedural treatment with the RenalGuard system or standard treatment by pre- and postprocedural intravenous hydration. Primary endpoint was the occurrence of AKI after TAVI, and secondary endpoints were assessed according to valve academic research consortium 2 criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, the prevalence of AKI was 18.4% (n = 18). The majority of these patients developed mild AKI according to stage 1. Comparing RenalGuard to standard therapy, no significant differences were observed in the occurrence of AKI (RenalGuard: 21.3%; control group: 15.7%; p = 0.651). In addition, there were no differences between the groups with regard to 30-day and 12-month mortality and procedure-associated complication rates.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this randomized trial, we did not detect a reduction in AKI after TAVI by using the RenalGuard system. A substantial number of patients with chronic kidney disease developed AKI after TAVI, whereas the majority presented with mild AKI according to stage 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04537325)."
A Low Psoas Muscle Index before Treatment Can Predict a Poorer Prognosis in Advanced Bladder Cancer Patients Who Receive Gemcitabine and Nedaplatin Therapy.,"Ryo Kasahara, Takashi Kawahara, Shinji Ohtake, Yoko Saitoh, Sohgo Tsutsumi, Jun-Ichi Teranishi, Yasuhide Miyoshi, Noboru Nakaigawa, Masahiro Yao, Kazuki Kobayashi, Hiroji Uemura, Ryo Kasaharaet al.",2017:2017:7981549.,Biomed Res Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28497065/,No keywords found,"Introduction. Gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) is a gold-standard first-line systemic chemotherapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). However, it may cause severe adverse effects such as renal toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and neurotoxicity. Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass. A correlation between sarcopenia and the oncological prognosis has been reported. In UC, several studies have noted that patients with sarcopenia had a greater incidence of complications and worse survival after radical cystectomy or chemotherapy. Our institute introduced gemcitabine and nedaplatin (GN) for UC patients with renal failure. We investigated whether the presence of sarcopenia predicted the prognosis of patients with advanced UC who were treated by GN chemotherapy. Methods. A total of 27 patients (male, n = 21; female, n = 6) received GN therapy for metastatic UC from 2005 to 2016. The institutional review board of Yokohama City University Hospital approved this study. The psoas muscle index (PMI, cm2/m2) was calculated using this formula: right psoas muscle area (cm2)/the square of the body height (m2). The overall survival (OS) of the high PMI group (male: ≥2.49, female: ≥2.07) and low PMI group (male: <2.49, female: <2.07) was compared. Results. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a log-rank test revealed that the high PMI group had significantly better OS than the low PMI group (p = 0.015). The mean survival of the high and low PMI groups was 561 days and 223 days, respectively. Conclusions. In the present study, we revealed that sarcopenia (a low psoas muscle volume) might be a predictive factor for poorer overall survival in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who are undergoing GN chemotherapy."
Efficacy of Short Hydration for Intermediate to High-Dose Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy for Outpatients: SHORTCIS Trial.,"Chaichana Chantharakhit, Nantapa Sujaritvanichpong, Chaichana Chantharakhitet al.",2022 Oct 1,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36308355/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      Supporting data exists concerning short hydration to prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. However, only a few studies exist. Further, data remains limited, comprising mostly retrospective data. Therefore, the study would like to evaluate the efficacy of short hydration using a prospective cohort study.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This is a prospective cohort non-randomized controlled study in patients receiving intermediate to high doses of cisplatin. Short hydration was set as the intervention arm, while conventional hydration was set as the controlled arm. The consecutive estimates glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) were compared at baseline, Week 3, Week 6, Week 9, Week 12, and Week 15 for both groups by using multilevel regression analysis with the random-effects model with double adjustment (propensity score and confounding adjustment) was used. The trial was registered with the Thai Registry of Clinical Trials, SHORTCIS ThaiClinicalTrials.org, number TCTR20210128002.
    


          Results:
        
      
      30 patients were registered. 14 were assigned to a short hydration group, while 16 were assigned to a conventional hydration group. The levels of consecutive eGFR of the group receiving short hydration were stable (regression coefficients 0.05), while the levels of consecutive eGFR of the group receiving conventional hydration were declined (regression coefficients -1.94). The multilevel regression analysis of consecutive eGFR between conventional group and short hydration group when adjusted for random-effects parameters and double adjustment were significantly different (p-value = 0.001). When analyzing the relationship of received short hydration, it could significantly reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity as well, i.e. acute kidney injury (odds ratio 0.06, 95%CI 0.003, 0.990, p-value 0.049).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Short hydration was more efficient for preventing nephrotoxicity than conventional hydration protocols in patients receiving intermediate to high doses of cisplatin."

      The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of 15 mEq magnesium supplied as part of a prehydration regimen in preventing cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in patients undergoing therapy with cisplatin-alone (40 mg/m(2)/week) for cervical cancer.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      We studied 28 patients with cervical cancer. This prospective cohort study compared nephrotoxicity in patients who received hydration with and without magnesium sulfate (Mg-hydration group, n=14; non-Mg-hydration group, n=14).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline characteristics, stage of cervical cancer, cisplatin dose and renal function did not differ significantly between the two groups. The serum creatinine level significantly increased from 0.58 to 0.75 mg/dl, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate significantly decreased from 85.1 to 66.5 ml/min by chemotherapy in the non-Mg-hydration group. In contrast, these levels did not change significantly in the Mg-hydration group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A magnesium dose of 15 mEq was found to provide nephroprotective effects among patients with cervical cancer undergoing chemotherapy with cisplatin alone."

In this case-control study, we evaluated the clinical outcomes and safety of telavancin in cancer patients with uncomplicated Gram-positive bloodstream infections (BSIs). Between March 2011 and May 2013, we enrolled cancer patients with uncomplicated Gram-positive BSIs to receive intravenous telavancin therapy for at least 14 days for Staphylococcus aureus and 7 days for other Gram-positive cocci. Patients with baseline creatinine clearance (CLCR) values of >50 ml/min received 10 mg/kg/day of telavancin, and those with CLCR values between 30 and 49 ml/min received 7.5 mg/kg/day. Patients were compared with a retrospective cohort of 39 historical patients with Gram-positive BSIs, matched for underlying malignancy, infecting organism, and neutropenia status, who had been treated with vancomycin. A total of 78 patients were analyzed, with 39 in each group. The most common pathogen causing BSIs was S. aureus (51%), followed by alpha-hemolytic streptococci (23%), Enterococcus spp. (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (3%). Sixty-two percent of patients had hematological malignancies, and 38% had solid tumors; 51% of the patients were neutropenic. The overall response rate determined by clinical outcome and microbiological eradication at 72 h following the initiation of therapy, in the absence of relapse, deep-seated infections, and/or infection-related death, was better with telavancin than with vancomycin (86% versus 61%; P = 0.013). Rates of drug-related adverse events were similar in the two groups (telavancin, 31%; vancomycin, 23%; P = 0.79), with similar rates of renal adverse events. Telavancin may provide a useful alternative to standard vancomycin therapy for Gram-positive BSIs in cancer patients. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no.

Utility of N-acetylcysteine in ischemic hepatitis in cirrhotics with acute variceal bleed: a randomized controlled trial.,"Rakhi Maiwall, Awinash Kumar, Ajeet Singh Bhadoria, Ankur Jindal, Guresh Kumar, Ankit Bhardwaj, Jaswinder Singh Maras, Manoj Kumar Sharma, Barjesh Chandra Sharma, Shiv Kumar Sarin, Rakhi Maiwallet al.",2020 Jul,Hepatol Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32048131/,No keywords found,"Background and aims:
        
      
      Ischemic hepatitis (IH) following acute variceal bleed (AVB) carries an ominous prognosis. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent anti-oxidant, may prevent IH by improving tissue oxygen delivery and improving hepatic hypoxia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Consecutive cirrhotics with AVB were prospectively randomized to receive either standard of care (SOC) plus NAC intravenously for 72 h(at 150 mg/kg/h for 1 h followed by 12.5 mg/kg/h for 4 h, followed by 6.25 mg/kg for 67 h) (Group A, n = 107) or SOC alone (Group B, n = 107).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline characteristics were comparable. IH developed more frequently in Gr.B 25(23%) than A-15(14%); p = 0.08). Incidence of IH increased with severity of liver disease. Binary logistic regression analysis showed reduced incidence of IH in Gr.A than B [odds ratio (OR) 0.33, 0.11-0.93] patients after controlling for other significant factors. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was also reduced in Gr.A [OR 0.34, 0.15-0.75]. Development of IH was significantly associated with increased deaths due to liver failure at 6 weeks [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 21.6, 7.4-62.8]. On multivariate competing risk analysis, significantly lower deaths due to liver failure (SHR 0.33, 0.11-0.97) were noted in Gr.A than B.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      One in five patients with acute variceal bleed develops ischemic hepatitis which is associated with worse outcomes. NAC therapy averts deaths due to liver failure by preventing IH and reduces AKI and is, therefore, recommended for cirrhotics with acute variceal bleed.

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel combined with a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg/m2) delivered via hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to patients with ovarian cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This multicenter Phase I trial employed a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design. The MTD was determined to have a target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of 25%. The starting dose was 175 mg/m2. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board made decisions regarding dose escalation or de-escalation in increments of 25 mg/m2 for subsequent patient cohorts, up to a maximum sample size of 30 or 12 patients treated at a given dose.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-one patients participated in this study. Among the three evaluable patients who received 150 mg/m2 paclitaxel, no DLTs were observed. Among the 12 evaluable patients who received 175 mg/m2 paclitaxel, two reported DLTs: one had grade 4 neutropenia and one had grade 4 anemia, neutropenia, and leukopenia. Four of the six evaluable patients who received 200 mg/m2 paclitaxel reported DLTs: one patient had grade 4 diarrhea, one had grade 3 kidney injury, and two had grade 4 anemia. The isotonic estimate of the DLT rate in the 175 mg/m2 dose group was 0.17 (95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.42), and this dose was selected as the MTD.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Paclitaxel, when combined with a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg/m2), can be safely administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 175 mg/m2 in patients with ovarian cancer who received HIPEC (43 °C, 90 min) following cytoreductive surgery."

AKI as the primary outcome of this study occurred only in one patient in group C and the rate of AKI did not differ significantly among patients receiving different types of fluid resuscitation (P > 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Normal saline was equivalent to fluids containing alkalinizing agents in preventing heme-induced nephropathy in patients with G6PDd. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information."
Randomized Controlled Trial to Determine the Efficacy of Early Switch From Vancomycin to Vancomycin Alternatives as a Strategy to Prevent Nephrotoxicity in Patients With Multiple Risk Factors for Adverse Renal Outcomes (STOP-NT).,"Joseph J Carreno, Rachel M Kenney, George Divine, Jose A Vazquez, Susan L Davis, Joseph J Carrenoet al.",2017 Mar,Ann Pharmacother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27838680/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Use of alternative antimicrobials to vancomycin is a potential strategy to reduce acute kidney injury (AKI) in high-risk patients, but current data do not support widespread adoption of this practice.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine the efficacy of early switch to a nonnephrotoxic alternative for prevention of AKI in high-risk patients who receive vancomycin.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was an IRB-approved, prospective randomized controlled trial in a single, tertiary care academic medical center. Patients initially prescribed vancomycin between October 2011 to April 2013 with at least 2 risk factors for AKI were included. Treatment randomization was stratified by indication for therapy. Patients were randomized to continuation of dose-optimized vancomycin or early switch to an alternative antimicrobial agent. The primary end point was nephrotoxicity by consensus guideline definition adjudicated by blinded review; the secondary end point was AKI network-defined AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 103 patients were randomized; 100 were included in the modified intent-to-treat population, 51 in the vancomycin group and 49 in the alternative group. The incidence of nephrotoxicity was 6.1% in the alternative therapy arm and 9.8% in the vancomycin group ( P = 0.72). The incidence of AKI was 32.7% in the alternative therapy group and 31.4% in the vancomycin group ( P = 0.89).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      No significant difference in nephrotoxicity or AKI was detected among patients treated with alternative antimicrobials compared with vancomycin. The use of alternative antimicrobial therapy instead of vancomycin solely for the purpose of preventing AKI in high-risk patients does not appear to be warranted."
Negligible Systemic Uptake of Suprafascial Vancomycin Powder Following Instrumented Posterior Spinal Fusion-Preliminary Results From A Randomized Clinical Trial (VANCO Trial).,"Ralph T Schär, C Marvin Jesse, Matteo Montalbetti, Nicole Söll, Katharina Lutz, Valentin Steinsiepe, Mattia Branca, Andreas Raabe, Stefan Zimmerli, Ralph T Schäret al.",2021 Nov 18,Neurosurgery,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34528089/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intrawound vancomycin powder is an emerging strategy to reduce surgical site infections (SSIs) in spine surgery. However, there are concerns relating to its safety profile and toxicity. Data on systemic uptake of suprafascially administered vancomycin powder following instrumented spinal fusion is lacking.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To study the systemic uptake and safety of suprafascially administered vancomycin powder in the early postoperative phase following open instrumented posterior spinal fusion.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a substudy of an ongoing randomized clinical trial. Eligible adult patients were randomized 1:1 to either receive suprafascial vancomycin powder before wound closure or not to receive vancomycin powder. Serum vancomycin levels were assessed on postoperative days 1 and 2, serum creatinine levels were measured pre- and post-operatively. Adverse events up to 6 wk following surgery were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 34 randomized patients (mean age 62 yr, range 31-84 yr; 18 [53%] women), 17 received vancomycin powder. No detectable serum vancomycin levels (>4.0 mg/L) were found. Proportion of adverse events per patient in the vancomycin and control group, respectively, were 29.4% (5/17) vs 11.8% (2/17) (OR 3.12; 95% CI, 0.52; 19.38; P = .398). No patient had nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity in either group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Suprafascial vancomycin powder in open instrumented spinal fusion surgery is safe and results in negligible systemic uptake. Final results of the VANCO Trial need to be awaited for conclusive data on the efficacy of vancomycin for SSI prevention and its impact on wound healing."
Effects of Renal Impairment on Steady-State Plasma Concentrations of Rivastigmine: A Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Capsule and Patch Formulations in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.,"Gilbert Lefèvre, Francesca Callegari, Sandro Gsteiger, Yuan Xiong, Gilbert Lefèvreet al.",2016 Oct,Drugs Aging,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27681702/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of renal function, decreases by approximately 10 mL/min every 10 years after the age of 40 years, which could lead to the accumulation of drugs and/or renal toxicity. Pharmacokinetic studies of drugs excreted both renally and non-renally are desirable in patients with impaired renal function, defined by parameters including estimated GFR (eGFR) and creatinine clearance (CLCR).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We describe here a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the possible effects of renal impairment on steady-state plasma concentrations of rivastigmine and its metabolite NAP226-90 after rivastigmine patch (5 cm2 [4.6 mg/24 h], 10 cm2 [9.5 mg/24 h], 15 cm2 [13.3 mg/24 h], and 20 cm2 [17.4 mg/24 h]) and capsule (1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 mg/12 h) treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The data used to conduct the current pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained from the pivotal phase III, 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group study (IDEAL). One blood sample was collected from each patient at steady-state to measure plasma concentrations of rivastigmine and NAP226-90 using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The steady-state plasma concentrations of rivastigmine and NAP226-90 were plotted against CLCR and eGFR data, and boxplots were constructed after stratification by renal function.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The two groups (mild/no renal impairment vs. moderate/severe/end-stage renal impairment) showed comparable demographic covariates for all patch sizes and capsule doses. No correlation was observed between CLCR or eGFR and plasma concentrations of rivastigmine or NAP226-90. Boxplots of concentrations of rivastigmine or NAP226-90 for each dose largely overlapped for patch and capsule. Additionally, model-based estimates of plasma concentrations adjusted for body weight yielded similar results.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results of this study show that renal function does not affect rivastigmine or NAP226-90 steady-state plasma concentrations, and no dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is required. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT00099242."
High clinical and morphologic response using (90)Y-DOTA-octreotate sequenced with (177)Lu-DOTA-octreotate induction peptide receptor chemoradionuclide therapy (PRCRT) for bulky neuroendocrine tumours.,"Grace Kong, Jason Callahan, Michael S Hofman, David A Pattison, Tim Akhurst, Michael Michael, Peter Eu, Rodney J Hicks, Grace Konget al.",2017 Mar,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27678267/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Bulky disease is an adverse prognostic factor for 177Lu-DOTA-octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). 90Y-DOTA-octreotate (90Y-DOTATATE) has theoretical advantages in this setting but may less effectively treat co-existent smaller deposits and have higher toxicity than 177Lu-DOTATATE. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of using these agents sequentially.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We reviewed patients (pts) with at least one lesion of a transaxial diameter >4 cm who completed 1-2 cycles of 90Y-DOTATATE followed by 2-3 cycles of 177Lu-DOTATATE, with treatment empirically adapted to disease size and burden in individual patients. Data collected included morphological and molecular imaging response, toxicity, and progression-free and overall survival.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-six pts (17 men; aged 27-74 years) received a median cumulative activity of 6.5 GBq 90Y-DOTATATE, and 21 GBq 177Lu-DOTATATE. All but one received radiosensitising chemotherapy. Adverse prognostic factors included ENETS grade 2 or 3 in 58 %, and FDG-avid disease in 73 %. Nineteen pts treated for progressive disease had stabilisation (37 %) or regression on CT (42 % partial response, 21 % minor response), with a mean 59 % (8-99 %) reduction in disease burden. All seven pts treated for uncontrolled symptoms reported improvement during PRRT with 4/7 having complete symptom resolution at 3 months. Eight patients had grade 3/4 lymphopaenia, and two patients grade 3/4 thrombocytopaenia without significant hepatic or renal toxicity. Median survival was not reached after a median follow-up of 35 months. Median progression-free survival was 33 months.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      PRCRT with 90Y -DOTATATE followed by 177Lu-DOTATATE in individualised regimens achieved high clinical and morphological response in patients with bulky tumours. Despite lack of a control arm, the efficacy of this treatment approach appears higher than reported results with either agent used alone or other approved treatments, particularly given the adverse prognostic features of this cohort."
Comparison of 6% hydroxyethyl starch and 5% albumin for volume replacement therapy in patients undergoing cystectomy (CHART): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Tobias Kammerer, Florian Klug, Michaela Schwarz, Sebastian Hilferink, Bernhard Zwissler, Vera von Dossow, Alexander Karl, Hans-Helge Müller, Markus Rehm, Tobias Kammereret al.",2015 Aug 28:16:384.,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26314293/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The use of artificial colloids is currently controversial, especially in Central Europe Several studies demonstrated a worse outcome in intensive care unit patients with the use of hydroxyethyl starch. This recently even led to a drug warning about use of hydroxyethyl starch products in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The data on hydroxyethyl starch in non-critically ill patients are insufficient to support perioperative use.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      We are conducting a single-center, open-label, randomized, comparative trial with two parallel patient groups to compare human albumin 5% (test drug) with hydroxyethyl starch 6% 130/0.4 (comparator). The primary endpoint is cystatin C ratio, calculated as the ratio of the cystatin value at day 90 after surgery relative to the preoperative value. Secondary objectives are inter alia the evaluation of the influence of human albumin and hydroxyethyl starch on further laboratory chemical and clinical parameters, glycocalyx shedding, intensive care unit and hospital stay and acute kidney injury as defined by RIFLE criteria (risk of renal dysfunction, injury to the kidney, failure of kidney function, loss of kidney function, and end-stage kidney disease) criteria.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      There is a general lack of evidence on the relative safety and effects of hydroxyethyl starch compared with human albumin for volume replacement in a perioperative setting. Previously conducted studies of surgical patients in which researchers have compared different hydroxyethyl starch products included too few patients to properly evaluate clinical important outcomes such as renal function. In the present study in a high-risk patient population undergoing a major surgical intervention, we will determine if perioperative fluid replacement with human albumin 5% will have a long-term advantage over a third-generation hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 on the progression of renal dysfunction until 90 days after surgery.

      We performed a phase I, single-arm, non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation trial to determine the dose-limiting toxicity of intraperitoneal cisplatin and doxorubicin applied as pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) in women with recurrent ovarian cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design with doxorubicin 1.5 mg/m2, cisplatin 7.5 mg/m2 q 4 to 6 weeks for 3 cycles and subsequent dose escalation steps (20% increment per step) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Toxicity and clinical efficacy were monitored. The primary endpoint was the maximum-tolerable dose. Secondary endpoints included histologic tumor regression and serum parameters.
    


          Results:
        
      
      15 evaluable patients (3, 7, and 5 in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively) on average received 2.3 PIPAC cycles. No dose limiting toxicities were found. Adverse side effects were 1 grade 3 event (colon perforation) and 85 grade 1/2 events including fatigue (n = 19), abdominal pain (n = 18), nausea/vomiting (n = 14), sleep disorder (n = 8), diarrhea (n = 5), and fever (n = 2). Liver and renal toxicity was not observed in any of the 3 cohorts (AST 19.1 ± 3.2, 25.8 ± 6.5, and 22.1 ± 4.5 IU/L, respectively; ALT 14.7 ± 3.5, 18.5 ± 5.6, and 23.3 ± 13.0 IU/L, respectively; GGT 45.7 ± 35.1, 25.2 ± 10.3, and 43.9 ± 26.4 IU/L, respectively; serum creatinine 1.06 ± 0.23, 0.80 ± 0.17, and 0.89 ± 0.35 mg/dL, respectively). No systemic hematologic toxicity, alopecia, or neurotoxicity was noted. The maximum tolerable dose was not reached. Histologic tumor regression was observed in 7/11 (64%) patients who underwent ≥2 PIPAC cycles.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PIPAC with cisplatin and doxorubicin may be safely used at an intraperitoneal dose of 10.5 mg/m2 and 2.1 mg/m2, respectively. Systemic toxicity of this therapy is low."
The effects of 0.9% saline versus Plasma-Lyte 148 on renal function as assessed by creatinine concentration in patients undergoing major surgery: A single-centre double-blinded cluster crossover trial.,"Laurence Weinberg, Michael Hua-Gen Li, Leonid Churilov, Christopher Macgregor, Kent Garrett, Jade Eyles, Rinaldo Bellomo, Laurence Weinberget al.",2021 May 19,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34010324/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Saline and Plasma-Lyte have different physiochemical contents; consequently, they may differently affect patients' renal function. We compared the effects of fluid therapy with 0.9% saline and with Plasma-Lyte 148 on renal function as assessed by creatinine concentration among patients undergoing major surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a prospective, double-blinded cluster crossover trial comparing the effects of the two fluids on major surgery patients. The primary aim was to establish the pilot feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy evidence base for a large interventional trial to establish whether saline or Plasma-Lyte is the preferred crystalloid fluid for managing major surgery patients. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with changes in renal function as assessed by creatinine concentration during their index hospital admission. We used changes in creatinine to define acute kidney injury (AKI) according to the RIFLE criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study was feasible with 100% patient and clinician acceptance. There were no deviations from the trial protocol. After screening, we allocated 602 patients to saline and 458 to Plasma-Lyte. The median (IQR) volume of intraoperative fluid received was 2000 mL (1000:2000) in both groups. Forty-nine saline patients (8.1%) and 49 Plasma-Lyte patients (10.7%) developed a postoperative AKI (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]: 1.34; 95% CI: 0.93-1.95; p = 0.120). No differences were observed in the development of postoperative complications (aIRR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.89-1.08) or the severity of the worst complication (aIRR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.78-1.30). The median (IQR) length of hospital stay was six days (3:11) for the saline group and five days (3:10) for the Plasma-Lyte group (aIRR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73-0.98). There were no serious adverse events relating to the trial fluids, nor were there fluid crossover or contamination events.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study design was feasible to support a future follow-up larger clinical trial. Patients treated with saline did not demonstrate an increased incidence of postoperative AKI (defined as changes in creatinine) compared to those treated with Plasma-Lyte. Our findings imply that clinicians can reasonably use either solution intraoperatively for adult patients undergoing major surgery.

"Phase I study of cisplatin, hyperthermia, and lapatinib in patients with recurrent carcinoma of the uterine cervix in a previously irradiated area.","Esther van Meerten, Martine Franckena, Erik Wiemer, Lena van Doorn, Jaco Kraan, Anneke Westermann, Stefan Sleijfer, Esther van Meertenet al.",2015 Mar,Oncologist,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660155/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with recurrent cervical cancer in a previously irradiated area might benefit from cisplatin combined with hyperthermia. Lapatinib inhibits the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2. Overexpression of EGFR and HER2 is frequently seen in patients with cervical cancer and is potentially involved in chemotherapy resistance. In addition, preclinical data suggest a synergistic effect of combining cisplatin and lapatinib. Consequently, this phase I dose-escalation study was performed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lapatinib added to fixed doses of cisplatin and hyperthermia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eight patients with previously irradiated recurrent cervical carcinoma were enrolled and scheduled for 6 weekly administrations of 70 mg/m(2) cisplatin combined with locoregional hyperthermia. Hyperthermia consisted of the achievement of intraluminal temperatures of 40-43°C as homogeneously as possible over 60 minutes. Daily lapatinib was added on days 1-56, starting with a dose level of 1,000 mg. The MTD was defined as the highest dose at which ≤1 of 6 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT was defined as grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days, febrile neutropenia grade ≥3, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade ≥2 renal toxicity, postponement of cisplatin and hyperthermia for ≥2 weeks, or grade ≥3 nonhematologic adverse events except for nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, or skin toxicity, for which the following DLT definitions were applied: grade ≥3 persistent nausea or vomiting or diarrhea despite optimal medical treatment or grade 4 skin toxicity. Safety, pharmacodynamics, and response were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The first two patients of both the 1,000- and 750-mg dose level experienced DLTs. Of the four patients treated at dose level -2 (500 mg), only one patient was able to complete the treatment as planned, two patients experienced a DLT, and one patient was not evaluable because of early progressive disease. In the evaluable patients, one patient with progressive disease, four patients with stable disease, and two patients with partial response were observed. One patient with a partial response had a resection of the local recurrence. Pathological analysis showed a complete pathological response. Enumeration of circulating endothelial cells measured at baseline and during therapy did not show consistent results. The same applied for the pharmacodynamic effects on Ki-67, p27Kip1, and EGFR in pretreatment and on-therapy skin biopsies.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      It is not feasible to combine lapatinib with fixed doses of cisplatin and hyperthermia in patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma in a previously irradiated area mainly because of increased cisplatin-related toxicity. The observed complete pathological response is intriguing and warrants further investigation of combinations consisting of HER2 blockade and cisplatin plus hyperthermia."
Blood pressure variability predicts adverse events and cardiovascular outcomes in SPRINT.,"Kenechukwu Mezue, Abhinav Goyal, Gregg S Pressman, Roy Matthew, Jay C Horrow, Janani Rangaswami, Kenechukwu Mezueet al.",2018 Sep,J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29984884/,"blood pressure variability, cardiovascular outcomes, hypertension.","SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) highlighted the benefits of intensive targeted antihypertensive therapy but resulted in higher rates of treatment-related adverse events. Blood pressure (BP) variability has emerged as a significant predictor of outcomes over and above levels of BP. Using the SPRINT data set, we aimed to determine the relationship of BP variability with cardiovascular outcomes and side effects of antihypertensive therapy. The analyses included all participants randomized in SPRINT who reached the target systolic BP (SBP) for their respective groups (intensive < 120 mm Hg; standard < 140 mm Hg). Coefficients of variation (CV) for SBP, diastolic BP (DBP), and PP for each patient characterized variability. Student t test was used to compare treatment arms for each CV metric. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent predictors of the SPRINT primary outcome and adverse events. P < .15 on univariate analysis was required to enter the model and P < .05 to remain in it. A total of 8884 patients (4561 standard group; 4323 intensive group) met inclusion criteria. DBP CV differed between the groups (9.12 ± 3.20 standard group; 9.47 ± 3.49 intensive group [P < .0001]). DBP CV predicted a greater hazard for the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14) in the overall model as well as separate analyses by treatment arms (standard group HR, 1.15; intensive group HR, 1.19), each P < .0001. DBP CV also independently predicted a greater hazard for acute kidney injury (HR, 1.12) and hypotensive events (HR, 1.12). Visit-to-visit DBP variability independently predicted worse cardiovascular outcomes and hypoperfusion-related adverse events in SPRINT."
"Switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed patients with chronic hepatitis B: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, multicentre non-inferiority study.","Pietro Lampertico, Maria Buti, Scott Fung, Sang Hoon Ahn, Wan-Long Chuang, Won Young Tak, Alnoor Ramji, Chi-Yi Chen, Edward Tam, Ho Bae, Xiaoli Ma, John F Flaherty, Anuj Gaggar, Audrey Lau, Yang Liu, George Wu, Vithika Suri, Susanna K Tan, G Mani Subramanian, Huy Trinh, Seung-Kew Yoon, Kosh Agarwal, Young-Suk Lim, Henry L Y Chan, Pietro Lamperticoet al.",2020 May,Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32087795/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with renal toxicity or reductions in bone mineral density, or both, in some patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Tenofovir alafenamide is a tenofovir prodrug with high intrahepatic concentrations of active drug and reduced systemic tenofovir exposures compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In patients with chronic HBV, tenofovir alafenamide has shown efficacy non-inferior to that of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with improved renal and bone safety. With this non-inferiority study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tenofovir alafenamide in patients with HBV infection switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate who are virally suppressed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with chronic HBV infection who had been receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 48 weeks or more and who had HBV DNA less than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for at least 12 weeks were recruited to this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority study. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg once a day or to continue tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once a day. The primary efficacy endpoint was loss of virological control, defined as the proportion of patients who received at least one dose of study drug who had HBV DNA of at least 20 IU/mL at week 48 by the modified US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm. Key safety endpoints were changes in hip and spine bone mineral density, estimated creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault, and markers of bone turnover and renal tubular function. The study was powered for non-inferiority in efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with a 4% margin. Investigators and patients were unaware of treatment allocation and on-treatment results. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02979613.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Participants in this study were enrolled between Dec 29, 2016, and Oct 20, 2017. 541 patients were screened and 490 patients were randomly assigned to switch to tenofovir alafenamide or to stay on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Two patients assigned to receive tenofovir alafenamide did not receive treatment; thus the full analysis set for efficacy and safety analyses consisted of 243 patients in the tenofovir alafenamide group and 245 in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group. At week 48, one patient from each treatment group (both <1%) had HBV DNA of at least 20 IU/mL (difference in proportion 0·0%, 95% CI -1·9 to 2·0), thereby showing non-inferior efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Patients who received tenofovir alafenamide had significantly increased bone mineral density at hip (mean change 0·66% [SD 2·08] vs -0·51% [SD 1·91]; difference in least square means 1·17% [95% CI 0·80 to 1·54; p<0·0001]) and at spine (mean change 1·74% [3·46] vs -0·11% [3·13]; difference in least square means 1·85% [1·24 to 2·46; p<0·0001]), creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault relative to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (median change 0·94 mL/min [IQR -4·47 to 6·24] vs -2·74 mL/min [-7·89 to 1·88]; p <0·0001), and improved markers of bone turnover and tubular function at week 48. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection (18 [7%] of 243 patients in the tenofovir alafenamide group and 16 [7%] of 245 patients in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group) and nasopharyngitis (13 [5%] of 243 patients in the tenofovir alafenamide group and 12 [5%] of 245 patients in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group). The incidence of grade 3 and above adverse events and serious adverse events was low and similar between groups. No viral resistance was observed in patients who qualified for viral sequencing.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      These findings suggest that tenofovir alafenamide can be substituted for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with HBV infection for improved safety without a loss of efficacy.

Is oral nano-curcumin formulation a safe and effective measure for preventing cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients?,"Sare Hosseini, Sara Rahsepar, Sara Naghipour, Sepideh Elyasi, Sare Hosseiniet al.",2024 Oct 1,Anticancer Drugs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39017207/,No keywords found,"Nephrotoxicity is one of the most important complications in cancer patients under treatment with cisplatin-containing regimens. Curcumin, as the most important active component of Curcuma longa, is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound. In this clinical trial, we assessed the preventive effect of nano-curcumin oral formulation against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients. In this triple-blind clinical trial 30 cancer patients on cisplatin were randomly included in the treatment group, receiving nano-curcumin 40 mg capsules ( n = 15) or the placebo group ( n = 15) twice a day during four chemotherapy courses. Kidney function was measured at the beginning of the study and then at the end of each course of chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in acute kidney injury occurrence rate and creatinine and blood urine nitrogen serum levels between the treatment and placebo groups at the end of each chemotherapy course ( P value >0.05). Just at the end of the first course, the difference was close to significant ( P = 0.055). We also found no difference in mortality and recurrence rate in an average 30-month follow-up. Nano-curcumin in the prescribed dose and duration was not effective in preventing cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients in comparison with the placebo. Further studies with larger sample size using different doses and duration of nano-curcumin are recommended."
"Clinical outcomes of linezolid and vancomycin in patients with nosocomial pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus stratified by baseline renal function: a retrospective, cohort analysis.","Ping Liu, Blair Capitano, Amy Stein, Ali A El-Solh, Ping Liuet al.",2017 May 22,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28532398/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether baseline renal function impacts treatment outcomes of linezolid and vancomycin (with a dose-optimized regimen) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of data generated from a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial (NCT 00084266). The analysis included 405 patients with culture-proven MRSA pneumonia. Baseline renal function was stratified based on creatinine clearance. Clinical and microbiological success rates and presence of nephrotoxicity were assessed at the end of treatment (EOT) and end of study (EOS). Multivariate logistic regression analyses of baseline patient characteristics, including treatment, were performed to identify independent predictors of efficacy. Vancomycin concentrations were analyzed using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. The relationships between vancomycin exposures, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index (trough concentration, area under the curve over a 24-h interval [AUC0-24], and AUC0-24/MIC) and efficacy/nephrotoxicity were assessed in MRSA pneumonia patients using univariate logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards regression analysis approach.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After controlling for use of vasoactive agents, choice of antibiotic therapy and bacteremia, baseline renal function was not correlated with clinical and microbiological successes in MRSA pneumonia at either end of treatment or at end of study for both treatment groups. No positive association was identified between vancomycin exposures and efficacy in these patients. Higher vancomycin exposures were correlated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity (e.g., hazards ratio [95% confidence interval] for a 5 μg/ml increase in trough concentration: 1.42 [1.10, 1.82]).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In non-dialysis patients, baseline renal function did not impact the differences in efficacy or nephrotoxicity with treatment of linezolid versus vancomycin in MRSA pneumonia."

      Despite aggressive pharmacotherapy and stenting, there is a residual risk of major adverse cardiovascular events among patients with acute coronary syndrome. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been a major target for secondary acute coronary syndrome prevention; however, a better understanding of the physiologic function of HDL has demonstrated that a high cholesterol efflux capacity, rather than high HDL concentrations alone, may be critical to improving outcomes. CSL112, a reconstituted, infusible human apolipoprotein A-I, has been demonstrated to increase cholesterol efflux capacity and to have a protective effect in experimental models of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
    


          Design:
        
      
      The AEGIS-I trial (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02108262) is a phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical trial to evaluate the hepatic and renal safety of multiple administrations of 2 doses of CSL112 among subjects with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Approximately 1,200 subjects (400 per treatment group) with either normal renal function or mild renal impairment will be enrolled up to 7 days after an AMI and will be stratified by renal function and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either 1 of 2 doses of CSL112 (either 2 g or 6 g) or placebo as a weekly 2-hour infusion over the course of 4 consecutive weeks. The coprimary safety endpoints will be the incidence of hepatic and renal toxicity, defined as either confirmed ALT >3 × ULN, total bilirubin >2 × ULN, serum creatinine ≥1.5×baseline value, or a new requirement for renal replacement therapy through the end of the active treatment period.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The AEGIS-I trial will characterize the safety profile of CSL112, a reconstituted formulation of apolipoprotein A-I, and will assess if administration to patients with a recent AMI is associated with a clinically significant alteration in either liver or kidney function when compared with placebo."

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a thiol compound with antioxidant and vasodilatory properties that has been investigated for the prevention of AKI in several clinical settings. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of intravenous NAC on the prevention of AKI in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients. A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted, and 80 patients were recruited to receive 100 mg/kg/day NAC or placebo as intermittent intravenous infusion from day -6 to day +15. AKI was determined on the basis of the Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End-stage renal disease and AKI Network criteria as the primary outcome. We assessed urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) on days -6, -3, +3, +9 and +15 as the secondary outcome. Moreover, transplant-related outcomes and NAC adverse reactions were evaluated during the study period. Statistical analysis was performed using appropriate parametric and non-parametric methods including Kaplan-Meier for AKI and generalized estimating equation for uNGAL. At the end of the trial, data from 72 patients were analysed (NAC: 33 patients and placebo: 39 patients). Participants of each group were not different considering baseline characteristics. AKI was observed in 18% of NAC recipients and 15% of placebo group patients, and the occurrence pattern was not significantly different (p = 0.73). Moreover, no significant difference was observed between groups for uNGAL measures (p = 0.10). Transplant-related outcomes were similar for both groups, and all patients had successful engraftment. Three patients did not tolerate NAC because of abdominal pain, shortness of breath and rash with pruritus and were dropped from the intervention group before transplantation. However, the frequency of adverse reactions was not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, our findings could not show any clinical benefits from high-dose NAC particularly for AKI prevention in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients."
Influence of 6% Hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.4 Versus Crystalloid Solution on Structural Renal Damage Markers After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: A Post Hoc Subgroup Analysis of a Prospective Trial.,"Thomas Datzmann, Markus Hoenicka, Helmut Reinelt, Andreas Liebold, Hagen Gorki, Thomas Datzmannet al.",2018 Feb,J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29221978/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      The restriction of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) has mandated changes in volume management based on data of critically ill patients. Reliable data of structural renal damage after HES treatment in cardiac surgical patients are lacking. The influence of 6% HES 130/0.4 was investigated in this study.
    


          Design:
        
      
      An exploratory post hoc subgroup analysis of a prospective trial was performed.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      The study was carried out at a university hospital.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Forty-four low-risk cardiac surgical patients were examined.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Twenty-two patients received only crystalloid solutions, and 22 were treated with balanced 6% HES 130/0.4.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Functional renal parameters and the structural biomarkers α-glutathione S-transferase, kidney injury molecule-1, liver fatty acid-binding protein, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were investigated. Volume balances, vasopressor dosages, blood losses, and coagulation parameters were compared. Most functional and structural renal parameters did not differ between the groups (serum creatinine p = 0.8380). Liver fatty acid-binding protein was transiently higher in the HES group only at 24 hours postoperatively (p = 0.0002). No differences in mortality, acute kidney injury, and need for renal replacement therapy were observed. Blood coagulation was significantly more compromised in the HES group at intensive care unit arrival (factor II, p = 0.0012; factor X, p = 0.0031; thrombocytes, p = 0.0010). Blood losses, and vasopressor dosages tended to be higher in HES-treated patients without significance.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Overall, the values and time courses of the biomarkers used did not indicate evidence of a mechanism for tubular injury caused by HES."

          Patients and methods:
        
      
      We used the Bayesian Escalation with Overdose Control design to test escalating doses of everolimus (5 or 10 mg) and buparlisib (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg) in eligible patients. Pharmacokinetic assessment was conducted using blood samples collected on cycle 1, days 8 and 15. Pharmacodynamic impact on mTOR/PI3K pathway modulation evaluated in paired skin biopsies collected at baseline and end of cycle 1.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We enrolled 43 patients, median age of 63 (range, 39-78) years; 25 (58.1%) females, 35 (81.4%) Caucasians, and 8 (18.6%) Blacks. The most frequent toxicities were hyperglycemia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and aspartate aminotransferase elevation. Dose-limiting toxicities observed in 7 patients were fatigue (3), hyperglycemia (2), mucositis (1), acute kidney injury (1), and urinary tract infection (1). The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination was established as everolimus (5 mg) and buparlisib (60 mg). The best response in 27 evaluable patients was progressive disease and stable disease in 3 (11%) and 24 (89%), respectively. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.7 (1.8-4.2) and 9 (6.4-13.2) months. Steady-state pharmacokinetic analysis showed dose-normalized maximum concentrations and AUC values for everolimus and buparlisib in combination to be comparable with single-agent pharmacokinetic.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The combination of everolimus and buparlisib is safe and well-tolerated at the RP2D of 5 and 60 mg on a continuous daily schedule."

To date, carfilzomib-associated TMA has predominantly been described in relapsed/refractory myeloma patients. We report eight patients with newly diagnosed myeloma who experienced TMA events while receiving carfilzomib on the phase II CARDAMON trial. The first three occurred during maintenance single-agent carfilzomib, two occurred at induction with carfilzomib given with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (KCd) and three occurred during KCd consolidation. At TMA presentation 6/8 were hypertensive; 7/8 had acute kidney injury and in three, renal impairment persisted after resolution of TMA in other respects. The mechanism of carfilzomib-associated TMA remains unclear, though patients with known hypertension seem particularly susceptible. Given the first three cases occurred during maintenance after a longer than five-week treatment break, a protocol amendment was instituted with: aggressive hypertension management, carfilzomib step-up dosing (20 mg/m2 on day 1) at start of maintenance before dose escalation to 56 mg/m2 maximum, and adding 10 mg dexamethasone as premedication to maintenance carfilzomib infusions. No further TMA events occurred during maintenance following this amendment and the TMA incidence reduced from 4·2 to 1·6 per 1 000 patient cycles."
Treating perinatal asphyxia with theophylline at birth helps to reduce the severity of renal dysfunction in term neonates.,"Alok Raina, Aakash Pandita, Rekha Harish, Monika Yachha, Ashu Jamwal, Alok Rainaet al.",2016 Oct,Acta Paediatr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27173369/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      Perinatal asphyxia is a common neonatal problem and contributes significantly to neonatal morbidity and mortality. This study was designed to determine whether theophylline could prevent or ameliorate renal dysfunction in term neonates with perinatal asphyxia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We randomised 159 severely asphyxiated term newborns to receive a single dose of 5 mg/kg intravenous theophylline (n = 78) or a placebo (n = 81) during the first hour of life. The infant's 24-hour fluid intake, urine volume, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and sodium excretion were recorded during days one, three and five of life, starting 12 hours after the theophylline or placebo infusion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Neonates in the theophylline group had lower serum creatinine levels (0.83 ± 0.35 versus 1.47 ± 0.61; p = 0.00) and higher endogenous creatinine clearance (32.16 ± 16.34 versus 17.73 ± 7.92; p = 0.00) than the placebo group. Severe renal dysfunction, namely acute kidney injury, was present in 36 (15%) of the neonates in the theophylline group versus 117 (48%) in the placebo group (p < 0.01).

Fluid loading in abdominal surgery - saline versus hydroxyethyl starch (FLASH Trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Emmanuel Futier, Matthieu Biais, Thomas Godet, Lise Bernard, Christine Rolhion, Justine Bourdier, Dominique Morand, Bruno Pereira, Samir Jaber                              ;, FLASH trial management committee, Emmanuel Futieret al.",2015 Dec 21:16:582.,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26690683/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Inappropriate fluid therapy during surgery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Few studies have examined the effects of particular types of fluids (crystalloid or colloid solutions) in surgical patients, especially with the goal of hemodynamic optimization. Isotonic saline is the most commonly used fluid worldwide but may be associated with potential nephrotoxicity. Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions are widely used in surgical patients as a component of goal-directed fluid optimization strategies, but several large multicenter studies have suggested increased rates of acute kidney injury and adverse events with the use of HES in ICU patients. Despite what may be inferred from physiological studies, the benefit and harm of 0.9 % saline and HES during hemodynamic therapy have not been clearly established in surgical patients.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      The FLASH trial is an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, two-arm trial, randomizing 826 patients with moderate-to-high risk of postoperative complications to receive 6 % HES 130/0.4 or 0.9 % saline during individualized goal-directed fluid optimization. The primary outcome measure is a composite of death or major postoperative complications within 14 days following surgery. The sample size will allow the detection of a 10 % absolute between-group difference in the primary outcome measure with a type 1 error rate of 5 % and power of 95 %, assuming a 5 % mortality rate and 20 % morbidity (thus 25 % for the composite endpoint).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The FLASH trial may provide important data on the efficacy and safety of commonly used fluid solutions and could have a significant impact on future treatment of surgical patients.

      The prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is poor in older adults and elderly patients, and subtype-oriented prospective trials are scarce in these patients. We present the results of three prospective parallel subtype-oriented protocols in fit patients older than 55 years.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      In 2008, three prospective phase II trials in patients older than 55 years were activated: ALLOLD07 for Philadephia (Ph) chromosome-negative ALL, ALLOPH07 for Ph-positive ALL, and BURKIMAB08 for mature B-ALL. Early death (ED), complete remission (CR), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      56, 53 and 21 patients from the ALLOLD07, ALLOPH07 and BURKIMAB08 trials, respectively, were evaluable. CR was 74%, 87% and 70%, with an ED rate of 13%, 11% and 15%, respectively. The medians of DFS were 8 and 38 months for ALLOLD07 and ALLOPH07 protocols, not being achieved in the BURKIMAB08 trial (p=0.001), and the median OS was 12, 37 and 25 months, respectively (p=0.030). Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and infections were less frequent in the ALLOPH07 trial vs. ALLOLD07 and BURKIMAB trials, and renal toxicity and mucositis were more frequent in the BURKIMAB08 trial vs. the ALLOLD07 and ALLOPH07 trials. ECOG score and WBC count had prognostic significance for OS in ALLOPH07 and BURKIMAB08 trials, whereas no prognostic factors were identified in ALLOLD07 protocol.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Subtype-oriented treatment had an impact in the outcome of older adults with ALL. The poorest outcome was observed in Ph-negative non-Mature B-cell ALL patients, for whom improvements in therapy are clearly needed."

One patient experienced abdominal cramps and diarrhea necessitating interruption of brincidofovir and none developed nephrotoxicity with brincidofovir. Thus, brincidofovir is well-tolerated and highly efficacious in controlling adenoviremia during the lymphopenic phase of HCT."

          Patients:
        
      
      Sixty patients who are planned to receive cisplatin for the first time were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups as Group 1 (n = 30) (standard treatment arm) and Group II (n = 30) (theophylline arm).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In both groups after the administration of cisplatin, GFR showed a significant decrease within time (p = 0.006). Urine NGAL levels were significantly high after 2 h of cisplatin administration (p < 0.001), no significant difference was observed between groups. However, when the time*group effects were considered together, higher NGAL levels were detected in the group not receiving theophylline (p = 0.025). After 5 days of cisplatin administration, urine protein levels were significantly higher in both groups (p < 0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Results showed that urine NGAL level is a superior biomarker compared to serum creatinine and serum cystatin C in the detection of early AKI. Theophylline was found not to bring a complete protection for the kidneys, but less nephrotoxicity was developed when compared to the group not receiving theophylline."
Clinical efficacy and safety of multidrug therapy including thrice weekly intravenous amikacin administration for Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary disease in outpatient settings: a case series.,"Ho Namkoong, Kozo Morimoto, Tomoyasu Nishimura, Hiromu Tanaka, Hiroaki Sugiura, Yoshitake Yamada, Atsuko Kurosaki, Takanori Asakura, Shoji Suzuki, Hiroshi Fujiwara, Kazuma Yagi, Makoto Ishii, Sadatomo Tasaka, Tomoko Betsuyaku, Yoshihiko Hoshino, Atsuyuki Kurashima, Naoki Hasegawa, Ho Namkoonget al.",2016 Aug 9:16:396.,BMC Infect Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27506679/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus) pulmonary disease is a refractory chronic infectious disease. Options for treating M. abscessus pulmonary disease are limited, especially in outpatient settings. Among parenteral antibiotics against M. abscessus, intravenous amikacin (AMK) is expected to be an effective outpatient antimicrobial therapy. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of intravenous AMK therapy in outpatients with M. abscessus pulmonary disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective chart review of cases of M. abscessus pulmonary disease evaluated patient background data, AMK dosage and duration, sputum conversion, clinical symptoms radiological findings, and adverse events. M. massiliense was excluded on the basis of multiplex PCR assay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirteen patients (2 men and 11 women) with M. abscessus pulmonary disease were enrolled at 2 hospitals. The median age at the initiation of intravenous AMK treatment was 65 years (range: 50-86 years). Patients received a median AMK dose of 12.5 mg/kg (range: 8.3-16.2 mg/kg) for a median duration of 4 months (range: 3-9 months). The addition of intravenous AMK led to sputum conversion in 10 of 13 patients, and 8 patients continued to have negative sputum status 1 year after treatment. Approximately half of the patients showed improvement on chest high-resolution computed tomography. There were no severe adverse events such as ototoxicity, vestibular toxicity, and renal toxicity.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Thrice weekly intravenous AMK administration in outpatient settings is effective and safe for patients with M. abscessus pulmonary disease."
Blockade of interleukin seventeen (IL-17A) with secukinumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients - the BISHOP study.,"Gustavo Gomes Resende, Ricardo da Cruz Lage, Samara Quadros Lobê, Amanda Fonseca Medeiros, Alessandra Dias Costa E Silva, Antônio Tolentino Nogueira Sá, Argenil José de Assis Oliveira, Denise Sousa, Henrique Cerqueira Guimarães, Isabella Coelho Gomes, Renan Pedra Souza, Renato Santana Aguiar, Roberto Tunala, Francisco Forestiero, Julio Silvio Souza Bueno Filho, Mauro Martins Teixeira, Gustavo Gomes Resendeet al.",2022 Aug,Infect Dis (Lond),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35485381/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with severe COVID-19 seem to evolve with a compromised antiviral response and hyperinflammation. Neutrophils are critical players in COVID-19. IL-17A plays a major role in protection against extracellular pathogens and neutrophil attraction/activation. We hypothesized that secukinumab, an anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody, could prevent the deleterious hyperinflammation in COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      BISHOP was a randomized, open-label, single-centre, phase-II controlled trial. Fifty adult patients hospitalized with PCR-positive Covid-19, were randomized 1:1 to receive 300 mg of secukinumab subcutaneously at day-0 plus standard of care (group A) or standard of care alone (group B). A second dose of 300 mg of secukinumab could be administered on day-7, according to staff judgement. The primary endpoint was ventilator-free days at day-28 (VFD-28). Secondary efficacy and safety outcomes were also explored.
    


          Results:
        
      
      An intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in VFD-28: 23.7 (95%CI 19.6-27.8) in group A vs. 23.8 (19.9-27.6) in group B, p = .62; There was also no difference in hospitalization time, intensive care unit demand and the incidence of circulatory shock, acute kidney injury, fungal or bacterial co-infections. There was no difference in the incidence of severe adverse events. Pulmonary thromboembolism occurred only in males and was less frequent in secukinumab-treated patients (4.2% vs. 26.2% p = .04). There was one death in each group. Upper airway viral clearance was also similar in both groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of Covid19 was not demonstrated. Secukinumab decreased pulmonary embolism in male patients. There was no difference between groups in adverse events and no unexpected events were observed."

      A phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine and S-1 combination chemotherapy in patients with metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with pathologically confirmed, unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic adenocarcinoma that originated from the intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ducts or gallbladder were assessed for eligibility. The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR). The treatment consisted of 1,000 mg/m(2) intravenous gemcitabine administered over 30 min on days 1 and 8, and 80 mg/m(2) oral S-1 on days 1-14 of each cycle. The treatment was repeated every 3 weeks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-eight patients were enrolled between November 2005 and 2010. All patients had metastatic disease, and the primary sites of cancer were as follows: gallbladder in 12 (31.6%), intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts in 23 (60.5%), and the ampulla of Vater in 3 (7.9%) patients. One patient achieved a complete response, and six experienced a partial response. The ORR was 20.6% (95% CI 8.5-36.7] in the per-protocol (PP) population, and 18.4% (95%CI 6.1-30.7) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population; the median response duration was 10.8 months. Nineteen patients had stable disease, and the disease control rate was 76.5% (95%CI 60.6-87.6) in the PP population. The median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (95%CI 1.8-6.9), and the median overall survival was 9.0 months (95%CI 4.0-13.9) with a 1-year survival rate of 44.7% (95%CI 29.0-61.5) in the ITT population. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were observed in 13 (37.1%), 9 (25.7%), 2 (5.7%), and 2 (5.7%) patients, respectively. One patient experienced a grade 3 febrile neutropenia without any documented infection. The grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities were hepatic toxicity (11.4%), anorexia (2.9%), and renal toxicity (2.9%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Gemcitabine and S-1 combination chemotherapy showed acceptable efficacy and favorable toxicity profiles. Therefore, it might offer an alternative therapeutic strategy in patients with BTC."

This trial aimed to minimize CNI exposure and total immunosuppression while maintaining efficacy. We performed a randomized controlled, open-label multicenter trial with early cyclosporine A (CsA) elimination. Patients started with basiliximab, prednisolone (P), mycophenolate sodium (MPS), and CsA. At 6 months, immunosuppression was tapered to P/CsA, P/MPS, or P/everolimus (EVL). Primary outcomes were renal fibrosis and inflammation. Secondary outcomes were estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and incidence of rejection at 24 months. The P/MPS arm was prematurely halted. The trial continued with P/CsA (N = 89) and P/EVL (N = 96). Interstitial fibrosis and inflammation were significantly decreased and the eGFR was significantly higher in the P/EVL arm. Cumulative rejection rates were 13% (P/EVL) and 19% (P/CsA), (p = 0.08). A post hoc analysis of HLA and donor-specific antibodies at 1 year after transplantation revealed no differences. An individualized immunosuppressive strategy of early CNI elimination to dual therapy with everolimus was associated with decreased allograft fibrosis, preserved allograft function, and good efficacy, but also with more serious adverse events and discontinuation. This can be a valuable alternative regimen in patients suffering from CNI toxicity."

      It is not known if use of colloid solutions containing hydroxyethyl starch (HES) to correct for intravascular deficits in high-risk surgical patients is either effective or safe.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the effect of HES 130/0.4 compared with 0.9% saline for intravascular volume expansion on mortality and postoperative complications after major abdominal surgery.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 775 adult patients at increased risk of postoperative kidney injury undergoing major abdominal surgery at 20 university hospitals in France from February 2016 to July 2018; final follow-up was in October 2018.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were randomized to receive fluid containing either 6% HES 130/0.4 diluted in 0.9% saline (n = 389) or 0.9% saline alone (n = 386) in 250-mL boluses using an individualized hemodynamic algorithm during surgery and for up to 24 hours on the first postoperative day, defined as ending at 7:59 am the following day.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was a composite of death or major postoperative complications at 14 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes included predefined postoperative complications within 14 days after surgery, durations of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and all-cause mortality at postoperative days 28 and 90.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 826 patients enrolled (mean age, 68 [SD, 7] years; 91 women [12%]), 775 (94%) completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 139 of 389 patients (36%) in the HES group and 125 of 386 patients (32%) in the saline group (difference, 3.3% [95% CI, -3.3% to 10.0%]; relative risk, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.91-1.34]; P = .33). Among 12 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, 11 showed no significant difference, but a statistically significant difference was found in median volume of study fluid administered on day 1: 1250 mL (interquartile range, 750-2000 mL) in the HES group and 1500 mL (interquartile range, 750-2150 mL) in the saline group (median difference, 250 mL [95% CI, 83-417 mL]; P = .006). At 28 days after surgery, 4.1% and 2.3% of patients had died in the HES and saline groups, respectively (difference, 1.8% [95% CI, -0.7% to 4.3%]; relative risk, 1.76 [95% CI, 0.79-3.94]; P = .17).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients at risk of postoperative kidney injury undergoing major abdominal surgery, use of HES for volume replacement therapy compared with 0.9% saline resulted in no significant difference in a composite outcome of death or major postoperative complications within 14 days after surgery. These findings do not support the use of HES for volume replacement therapy in such patients.

Safety and efficacy of lobaplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil as first-line induction chemotherapy followed by lobaplatin-radiotherapy in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: preliminary results of a prospective phase II trial.,"Liang-Ru Ke, Wei-Xiong Xia, Wen-Ze Qiu, Xin-Jun Huang, Jing Yang, Ya-Hui Yu, Hu Liang, Guo-Ying Liu, Yan-Fang Ye, Yan-Qun Xiang, Xiang Guo, Xing Lv, Liang-Ru Keet al.",2017 Feb 15,BMC Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28202000/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Due to improvements in imaging and radiological techniques as well as the use of chemotherapy, distant metastasis has become the predominant mode of treatment failure in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-NPC). Platinum-based systemic chemotherapy has shown survival benefits and is now the standard strategy for systemic therapy in patients with LA-NPC. Notably, the third-generation platinum reagent lobaplatin has shown anti-tumor effects in several solid tumors with lower incidences of gastrointestinal, hepatic and renal toxicity relative to other platinum drugs. However, the safety and efficacy of lobaplatin as a first-line regimen in patients with LA-NPC are undetermined.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with stage III-IVa-b NPC received lobaplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 22 combined with a continuous 120-h intravenous injection of 5-fluorouracil at a dose of 4 g/m2 followed by lobaplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 on days 43 and 64 concomitant with intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Objective response rates and acute toxicity were assessed based on RECIST (1.1) and CTCAE v.3.0, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate survival rates.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-nine patients were enrolled, and 44 patients (74.6%) received allocated cycles of chemotherapy. The objective response rates were 88.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.95) and 100% after induction chemotherapy (ICT) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT), respectively. With a median follow-up period of 44 months, the 3-year estimated progression-free survival and overall survival were 86.4% (95% CI, 69.8 to 98.8) and 94.9% (95% CI, 89.5 to 100), respectively. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (8.5%) and thrombocytopenia (40.7%) after ICT and CRT, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Lobaplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil followed by lobaplatin-RT treatment showed encouraging anti-tumor effects with tolerable toxicities in patients with LA-NPC. Randomized controlled trials of lobaplatin in patients with LA-NPC are warranted.

      This phase 1b study evaluated the safety and efficacy of 3 dose levels of carfilzomib when provided with fixed dose oral cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (KCyd) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      CHAMPION-2 was a multicenter single-arm study. Patients with newly diagnosed secretory MM were enrolled and received KCyd treatment for up to 8 cycles. A 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme was used to evaluate twice-weekly carfilzomib at 36, 45, and 56 mg/m2 dose levels, followed by a dose expansion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in any of the dose evaluation cohorts. The KCyd regimen that included the maximum planned carfilzomib dose of 56 mg/m2 twice weekly was brought forward into dose expansion. A total of 16 patients were treated at this dose level. At 56 mg/m2 the overall response rate was 87.5% (95% confidence interval, 61.7-98.4), and the median time to response of 14 patients whose disease responded to therapy was 1 month. At this dose level, common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were anemia (25.0%), neutropenia (18.8%), acute kidney injury (12.5%), and decreased white blood cell count (12.5%). Ten of 16 patients who received carfilzomib at 56 mg/m2 completed all 8 cycles, 5 patients discontinued study therapy before cycle 8 as a result of adverse events, and 1 patient discontinued therapy as a result of progressive disease.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Carfilzomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone is effective and has manageable toxicity for patients with newly diagnosed MM."

We attempted to evaluate the clinical usefulness of arbekacin in treating chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) by comparing its clinical efficacy and toxicity with those of vancomycin. Efficacy was classified according to bacterial elimination or bacteriologic failure and improved or failed clinical efficacy response. Ninety-five subjects were diagnosed with CSOM caused by MRSA. Twenty of these subjects were treated with arbekacin, and 36 with vancomycin. The bacteriological efficacy (bacterial elimination, arbekacin vs. vancomycin: 85.0% vs. 97.2%) and improved clinical efficacy (arbekacin vs. vancomycin; 90.0% vs. 97.2%) were not different between the two groups. However, the rate of complications was higher in the vancomycin group (33.3%) than in the arbekacin group (5.0%) (P=0.020). In addition, a total of 12 adverse reactions were observed in the vancomycin group; two for hepatotoxicity, one for nephrotoxicity, eight for leukopenia, two for skin rash, and one for drug fever. It is suggested that arbekacin be a good alternative drug to vancomycin in treatment of CSOM caused by MRSA."

      Target plasma level achievement has remained a challenge in neurosurgical intensive care unit patients receiving intravenous vancomycin. We evaluated continuous infusion (CI) and intermittent vancomycin dosing strategies in these patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective cohort compared CI vancomycin (target random levels, 20-30 mg/L) to intermittent vancomycin (target troughs, 15-20 mg/L) in regards to achievement of target plasma levels, nephrotoxicity, pharmacodynamic target attainment, and cost savings in 130 patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Continuous infusion resulted in greater achievement of goal plasma concentrations at the first steady-state level (40 vs 21.5%, P = .02), more rapid achievement of goal plasma concentrations (2.04 vs 3.76 days, P < .0001), and increased time within therapeutic range (55% vs 34%, P < .0001) but no significant difference in nephrotoxicity (15.4% vs 21.5%, P = .5). Continuous infusion improved pharmacodynamic target attainment (92.3% vs 30.8%, P < .0001) and also reduced levels drawn (3.8 vs 5.7, P = .0007), dose adjustments (1.4 vs 2.4, P = .0006), days of therapy (10.4 vs 14.1, P = .01), and mean total daily dose requirements (33 vs 35.7 mg/kg, P < .0001) per patient.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Continuous infusion appears beneficial for improving attainment of target plasma concentrations, pharmacodynamic goals, and financial burden, without increasing risk of acute kidney injury."

While vancomycin is effective against MRSA, its relatively poor penetration into lung secretions and dose-limiting renal toxicity make it less effective in the respiratory setting. As inhaled administration of vancomycin would overcome these limitations, we developed a dry powder formulation suitable for inhalation (AeroVanc). Here, we report a phase I, single-dose, dose-escalating study aimed at demonstrating safety and tolerability of AeroVanc. In part I, 18 healthy subjects received a single dose of 16 mg, 32 mg, or 80 mg of AeroVanc. Two subjects also received a 250-mg dose of intravenous vancomycin. In part 2 of the study, 32 mg and 80 mg AeroVanc were administered to subjects with cystic fibrosis as single doses. There were no serious side effects. A small drop in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was observed in 3 subjects with cystic fibrosis, one of whom required salbutamol. Vancomycin was rapidly absorbed after inhalation. Peak and mean plasma concentrations of vancomycin were dose proportional. The average minimum concentration of vancomycin in sputum remained above the usual MIC values for MRSA for up to 24 h (minimum sputum concentration [Cmin], 32-mg dose = 3.05 μg/ml, 80-mg dose = 8.0 μg/ml). In conclusion, AeroVanc was well tolerated and achieved high levels in sputum with a mean systemic absorption of 49%, making it a potential therapeutic strategy for respiratory infection with MRSA."

Especially in Europe, increasing attention has been focused on E. angustifolium extracts (EAEs), which are widely used for their positive effects on the symptoms of BPH, although human clinical trials are limited. The aim of this monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to evaluate if a daily intake of hard, gastric-resistant capsules containing a chemically characterized EAE (500 mg) for 6 months may allow a significant improvement in symptoms in subjects with BPH. This study was conducted in 128 adult men, randomly assigned to receive either EAE food supplement (N = 70) or placebo (N = 58), who underwent four visits (baseline = t0, after 15 days = t1, after 2 months = t2 and after 6 months = t3) in an outpatient setting to evaluate post-void residual (PVR) and prostate volume (PV) by means of prostate ultrasound, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and neutrofile/lymphocyte ratio (N/L), nocturia before the clinical visits and International Prostate Specific Score (IPSS) registered by the physicians. EAE food supplement induced a significant decrease in the PVR and consequently nocturia improving the quality of life as suggested by the decrease of IPSS. No subjects reported adverse effects related to oral intake of EAE food supplement. Moreover, EAE food supplement did not show hepatic or renal toxicity. In conclusion, EAE food supplements can be used in subjects with BPH, to improve their quality of life and general renal function."
Noninterventional follow-up vs fluid bolus in RESPONSE to oliguria-The RESPONSE trial protocol and statistical analysis plan.,"Nina Inkinen, Tuomas Selander, Ville Pettilä, Miia Valkonen, Minna Bäcklund, Johanna Wennervirta, Anni Pulkkinen, Johanna Hästbacka, Suvi T Vaara, Nina Inkinenet al.",2020 Sep,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32270496/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Oliguria is a frequent trigger for administering a fluid bolus, but the effect of fluid bolus in improving urine output is inadequately demonstrated. Here, we summarize the protocol and detailed statistical analysis plan of the randomized, controlled RESPONSE trial comparing follow-up as the experimental group and a 500 mL crystalloid fluid bolus as the control group for oliguria in critically ill oliguric patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Our trial is an investigator-initiated, randomized, controlled, pilot trial conducted in three ICUs in two centers. We aim to randomize 1:1 altogether 130 hemodynamically stable oliguric patients either to a 2-hour follow-up without interventions or to receive a crystalloid bolus of 500 mL over 30 minutes. The primary outcome is the change in individual urine output during the 2-hour period compared to 2 hours preceding randomization. Doubling of the urine output is considered clinically significant. Additionally, we record the duration of oliguria, physiological and biochemical variables, adverse events, and the incidences of acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Oliguria is a frequent trigger for potentially harmful fluid loading. Therefore, the RESPONSE trial will give information of the potential effect of fluid bolus on oliguria in critically ill patients.

Comparison of two Anti Snake Venom protocols in hemotoxic snake bite: A randomized trial.,"Pramod Sagar, Chanaveerappa Bammigatti, Tamilarasu Kadhiravan, K T Harichandrakumar, Rathinam Palamalai Swaminathan, Mahendra M Reddy, Pramod Sagaret al.",2020 Jul:73:101996.,J Forensic Leg Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32658754/,"Anti snake venom, Dosing protocol, Efficacy, Hemotoxic, Snake bite.","The dose of Anti Snake Venom (ASV) in hemotoxic snake bite depends on the amount of venom injected and species of snake. All trials in South East Asia have studied different doses of ASV, wherein the ASV in high dose group itself was lower than the dose that is recommended in Indian National protocol. These studies favored low dose protocol, as there was no difference in mortality and morbidity between the groups. So, this study intended to assess the efficacy of National protocol in reducing morbidity and mortality in hemotoxic snake bite in comparison to current protocol followed in institution. This was an open label randomized trial of 140 hemotoxic snakebite patients. Group A received national protocol: initial dose of 100 ml followed by 100 ml 6th hourly till 20-min Whole Blood Clotting Time (20WBCT) was negative or 300 ml of ASV was given, whichever was earlier. Group B received 70 ml followed by 30 ml every 6th hourly until two consecutive 20WBCT were negative. There was no statistical difference in the amount of ASV required in both the groups. Mortality and acute kidney injury were higher in group A (statistically not significant), probably due to sicker patients in that group. There was no relapse of clotting time abnormality in both the groups. In a significant number of patients (12%), clotting time was persistently prolonged till death. We found that the use of National ASV dosing protocol did not decrease the mortality and morbidity."
Renal Function Improvement Following ANG-3777 Treatment in Patients at High Risk for Delayed Graft Function After Kidney Transplantation.,"Jonathan S Bromberg, Matthew R Weir, A Osama Gaber, Michael A Yamin, Itzhak D Goldberg, Tracy J Mayne, Weizhong Cal, Matthew Cooper, Jonathan S Bromberget al.",2021 Feb 1,Transplantation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32265417/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients (20%-50%) undergoing renal transplantation experience acute kidney injury resulting in delayed graft function. ANG-3777 is an hepatocyte growth factor mimetic that binds to the c-MET receptor. In animal models, ANG-3777 decreases apoptosis, increases proliferation, and promotes organ repair and function.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of patients undergoing renal transplantation with <50 cc/h urine output for 8 consecutive hours over the first 24 hours posttransplantation, or creatinine reduction ratio <30% from pretransplantation to 24 hours posttransplantation. Subjects were randomized as 2:1 to 3, once-daily IV infusions of ANG-3777, 2 mg/kg (n = 19), or placebo (n = 9). Primary endpoint: time in days to achieve ≥1200 cc urine for 24 hours.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients treated with ANG-3777 were more likely to achieve the primary endpoint of 1200 cc urine for 24 hours by 28 days posttransplantation (83.3% versus 50% placebo; log-rank test: χ2 = 2.799, P = 0.09). Compared with placebo, patients in the ANG-3777 arm had larger increases in urine output; lower serum creatinine; greater reduction in C-reactive protein and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin; fewer dialysis sessions and shorter duration of dialysis; fewer hospital days; significantly less graft failure; and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate. Adverse events occurred in a similar percentage of subjects in both arms. Events per subject were twice as high in the placebo arm.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There was an efficacy signal for improved renal function in subjects treated with ANG-3777 relative to placebo, with a good safety profile."
Clinical Evaluation of a Vancomycin Dosage Strategy Based on a Serum Trough Concentration Model in Elderly Patients with Severe Pneumonia.,"Wei Yan, Xiao Yan Sun, Meng Wang, Fei Fan Zhao, Qing Tao Zhou, Wei Yanet al.",2023 May 20,Biomed Environ Sci,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37253666/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to evaluate the clinical benefits of a vancomycin dosage strategy based on a serum trough concentration model in elderly patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial categorized 66 elderly patients with severe pneumonia into study and control groups. The control group received vancomycin using a regimen decided by the attending physician. Meanwhile, the study group received individualized vancomycin therapy with a dosing strategy based on a serum trough concentration model. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with serum trough concentrations reaching the target values. The secondary endpoints were clinical response, vancomycin treatment duration, and vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (VA-AKI) occurrence.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All patients were at least 60 years old (median age = 81 years). The proportion of patients with target trough concentration achievement (≥ 15 mg/L) with the initial vancomycin regimen was significantly higher in the study group compared to the control group (75.8% vs. 42.4%, P = 0.006). Forty-five patients (68.2%) achieved clinical success, the median duration of vancomycin therapy was 10.0 days, and VA-AKI occurred in eight patients (12.1%). However, there were no significant differences in these parameters between the two groups. The model for predicting vancomycin trough concentrations was upgraded to: serum trough concentration (mg/L) = 17.194 - 0.104 × creatinine clearance rate (mL/min) + 0.313 × vancomycin daily dose [(mg/(kg∙d)].
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A vancomycin dosage strategy based on a serum trough concentration model can improve the proportion of patients achieving target trough concentrations in elderly patients with severe pneumonia."
Diltiazem co treatment with cyclosporine for induction of disease remission in sight-threatening non-infectious intraocular inflammation.,"Usama Shalaby, Usama Shalaby.",2017 Mar,Jpn J Ophthalmol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27943089/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      To investigate the effects of diltiazem co-treatment with microemulsified cyclosporine-A (CsA) on dosage, blood concentrations of CsA, as well as therapeutic and side effects in patients with sight-threatening non-infectious intraocular inflammation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label trial of 39 patients with sight-threatening non-infectious intraocular inflammation. The change in visual acuity (LogMAR), the grade of inflammatory activity, therapeutic concentration of CsA in the blood and systemic and renal toxicity were determined after comparing two groups, one treated with CsA and diltiazem (treatment group), and the other without diltiazem (control group).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared with the control group, the concentration of CsA in the blood of the treatment group significantly increased (P < 0.05) requiring a reduction in dosage of CsA (P < 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In patients with severe intraocular inflammation treated with CsA and diltiazem, blood concentrations of CsA increased as the dosage decreased. This efficient combination therapy reduced patient's economic burden, at the same time decreasing systemic and renal toxicity which in turn may promote the use of CsA for longer periods."
Outcomes of standard dose EC-MPS with low exposure to CsA in DCD renal transplantation recipients with DGF.,"C Ding, W Xue, P Tian, X Ding, X Pan, H Yan, H Xiang, X Feng, J Hou, X Tian, Y Li, J Zheng, C Dinget al.",2015 May:(183):8-15.,Int J Clin Pract Suppl,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26176940/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      The lower limit of exposure to cyclosporine A (CsA) has not yet been established in donation after cardiac death (DCD) renal transplantation recipients with delayed graft function (DGF) receiving enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) therapy. Stable and adequate mycophenolic acid (MPA) dosing may facilitate lower CsA exposure after DCD renal transplantation in recipients with DGF without compromising safety.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A 12-month, single-centre open-label prospective trial was performed in our centre. According to their DGF risk index using the previous DGF prediction models, we divided up the patients on oral CsA into either a DGF group (n = 26) and no DGF group (n = 48). All of the patients initially received the standard EC-MPS dosing (1440 mg/day). The initial dose of CsA in the low risk of DGF group was 4.5 mg/kg/day and in the high risk of DGF group was 2.5 mg/kg/day. Efficacy parameters, safety and tolerability were assessed over a 12-month study period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of DGF was 18.5% in the 162 DCD recipients. Between the DGF group and the no DGF group, the 1-year patient survival and graft survival were not significantly different. The incidence of BPAR was higher in the DGF group (26.9% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.032). Most patients in the DGF group had recovery of renal function after 1 month. The adverse events between the two groups were not significantly different. The daily EC-MPS doses of the DGF group were significantly higher than the no DGF group before the 6-month follow-up period. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the mean AUC levels during the follow-up period.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results show that low expose CsA with standard dosing of EC-MPS and thymoglobulin was efficacious, safe and well-tolerated in DCD renal transplant recipients with DGF in China. Furthermore, stable and adequate MPA exposure helped to reduce the dose of and exposure to CsA. Thus, this may lead to less-induced nephrotoxicity and better renal function recovery."
Postoperative Hydrocortisone Infusion Reduces the Prevalence of Low Cardiac Output Syndrome After Neonatal Cardiopulmonary Bypass.,"Stephen M Robert, Santiago Borasino, Robert J Dabal, David C Cleveland, Kristal M Hock, Jeffrey A Alten, Stephen M Robertet al.",2015 Sep,Pediatr Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25901540/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      Neonatal cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is often complicated by morbidity associated with inflammation and low cardiac output syndrome. Hydrocortisone ""stress dosing"" is reported to provide hemodynamic benefits in some patients with refractory shock. Development of cardiopulmonary bypass-induced adrenal insufficiency may provide further rationale for postoperative hydrocortisone administration. We sought to determine whether prophylactic, postoperative hydrocortisone infusion could decrease prevalence of low cardiac output syndrome after neonatal cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Double-blind, randomized control trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Pediatric cardiac ICU and operating room in tertiary care center.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Forty neonates undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized (19 hydrocortisone and 21 placebo). Demographics and known risk factors were similar between groups.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      After cardiopulmonary bypass separation, bolus hydrocortisone (50 mg/m²) or placebo was administered, followed by continuous hydrocortisone infusion (50 mg/m²/d) or placebo tapered over 5 days. Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing (1 μg) was performed before and after cardiopulmonary bypass, prior to steroid administration. Blood was collected for cytokine analysis before and after cardiopulmonary bypass.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Subjects receiving hydrocortisone were less likely to develop low cardiac output syndrome (5/19, 26% vs 12/21, 57%; p = 0.049). Hydrocortisone group had more negative net fluid balance at 48 hours (-114 vs -64 mL/kg; p = 0.01) and greater urine output at 0-24 hours (2.7 vs 1.2 mL/kg/hr; p = 0.03). Hydrocortisone group weaned off catecholamines and vasopressin sooner than placebo, with a difference in inotrope-free subjects apparent after 48 hours (p = 0.033). Five placebo subjects (24%) compared with no hydrocortisone subjects required rescue steroids (p = 0.02). Thirteen (32.5%) had adrenal insufficiency after cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients with adrenal insufficiency randomized to receive hydrocortisone had lower prevalence of low cardiac output syndrome compared with patients with adrenal insufficiency randomized to placebo (1/6 vs 6/7, respectively; p = 0.02). Hydrocortisone significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokines. Ventilator-free days, hospital length of stay, and kidney injury were similar.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Prophylactic, postoperative hydrocortisone reduces low cardiac output syndrome, improves fluid balance and urine output, and attenuates inflammation after neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Further studies are necessary to show if these benefits lead to improvements in more important clinical outcomes."
Mannitol Is Comparable to Hypertonic Saline for Raised Intracranial Pressure in Acute Liver Failure (MAHAL Study): A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Chetan Ramesh Kalal, Rakhi Maiwall, Ashok Choudhary, Madhumita Premkumar, Guresh Kumar, Ashish Kumar Vyas, Shiv Kumar Sarin, Chetan Ramesh Kalalet al.",2022,Dig Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34763338/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cerebral edema (CE) is central to development of hepatic encephalopathy in acute liver failure (ALF). Mannitol (MT) and hypertonic saline (HS) have been shown to improve CE. We compared the efficacy and safety of the 2 modalities.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      ALF with CE was prospectively randomized in an open study to receive either 5 mL/kg of either 3% HS, as continuous infusion; titrated every 6 hourly to achieve serum sodium of <160 (Group A; n = 26) or 1 g/kg of 20% MN as a IV bolus, repeated every 6 hourly (Group B; n = 25) in addition to standard ALF care. Primary end-point was reduction of ICP defined as optic nerve sheath diameter <5 mm and middle cerebral arterial pulsatility index <1.2 at 12 h.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-one patients with ALF, hepatitis E being commonest (33.3%), median jaundice to HE interval of 8 (1-16) days, were randomized to HS (n = 26) or MN (n = 25). Baseline characteristics were comparable including King's college criteria (>2: 38.4% vs.40%). Overall, 61.5% patients in the HS and 56% in the MN group showed reduction in ICP at 12 h (p = 0.25). Rebound increase in ICP indices was noted in 5 (20%) patients in MT and none in HS (p < 0.05) group. New onset acute kidney injury was common in the MT group than in the HS group. The ICU stay and 28-day transplant-free survival were not different between the groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While both agents had comparable efficacy in reducing ICP and mortality in ALF patients was comparable, HS was significantly better in preventing reducing rebound CE with lower renal dysfunction."
Safety and Efficacy of Low-Volume Preparation in the Elderly: Oral Sulfate Solution on the Day before and Split-Dose Regimens (SEE SAFE) Study.,"Min Seob Kwak, Jae Myung Cha, Hyo-Joon Yang, Dong Il Park, Kyeong Ok Kim, Jun Lee, Jeong Eun Shin, Young-Eun Joo, Jongha Park, Jeong-Sik Byeon, Hyun Gun Kim, Min Seob Kwaket al.",2019 Mar 15,Gut Liver,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30400725/,No keywords found,"Background/aims:
        
      
      The use of a low-volume bowel cleansing agent is associated with a greater willingness to undergo repeat colonoscopy. Oral sulfate solution (OSS) is a recently approved low-volume agent; however, its efficacy and safety in the elderly population remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the OSS preparation, in comparison to those of a standard polyethylene glycol (PEG; 4 L) preparation, in elderly patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded study was conducted. Participants were randomized to receive OSS or 4-L PEG with a split-dose regimen. Bowel cleansing efficacy was assessed using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). Acceptance, satisfaction, and preparation-related symptoms were recorded. Additionally, blood parameters were analyzed for electrolyte abnormalities and nephrotoxicity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 193 patients were analyzed. No group differences in overall bowel cleansing efficacy were observed, with ""adequate""preparations achieved in 95.9% (93/97) and 94.8% (91/96) of patients in the OSS and 4L PEG groups, respectively (p=0.747). However, mean BBPS scores for the entire (p=0.010) and right colon (p=0.001) were significantly higher in the OSS group than in the 4-L PEG group. The severity of clinical adverse events and frequency of acute kidney injury were similarly low, and no clinically meaningful electrolyte changes were identified. Self-reported scores regarding amount (p<0.001) and feeling (p=0.007), as well as overall satisfaction (p=0.001) and willingness to repeat the preparation (92.8% vs 67.7%, p<0.001), were significantly better in the OSS group than in the 4-L PEG group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In elderly individuals, OSS with a split-dose regimen has greater acceptability and comparable efficacy in bowel cleansing compared to 4-L PEG. (Clinical trials registration number: NCT03112967)."

      The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of perioperative N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration, a known antioxidant, on the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) after off-pump coronary bypass surgery (OPCAB) in patients with known risk factors of AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred and seventeen patients with ≥1 of the following risk factors of AKI were randomized into either the control (n = 57) or the NAC (n = 60) group; (i) preoperative serum creatinine >1.4 mg/dL; (ii) left ventricular ejection fraction <35% or congestive heart failure (iii) age >70 years (iv) diabetes or (v) re-operation. Patients in the NAC group received 150 mg/kg of NAC IV bolus at anaesthetic induction followed by a continuous infusion at 150 mg/kg per day for 24 h. AKI was diagnosed based on Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria during 48 h postoperatively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of AKI was 32% (19/60) and 35% (20/57) in the control and the NAC group, respectively (P = 0.695). The serum concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C were similar between the groups throughout the study period. Fluid balance including the amount of blood loss and transfusion requirement were similar between the groups except the amount of postoperative urine output, which was higher in the control group compared with the NAC group (5528 ± 1247 mL vs. 4982 ± 1185 mL, control vs. NAC, P = 0.017).

Diuretic response to colloid and crystalloid fluid loading in critically ill patients.,"Annemieke Smorenberg, A B Johan Groeneveld, Annemieke Smorenberget al.",2015 Feb,J Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24828327/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      In the critically ill patient, fluid loading is commonly done to stabilise hemodynamics and increase diuresis, whereas the absence of diuresis may predispose to harmful overloading. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the diuretic response and determinants thereof upon crystalloid and colloid fluid loading.
    


          Subjects and methods:
        
      
      This is a substudy on 42 clinically hypovolemic, septic or non-septic patients without acute kidney injury, who were randomly assigned, after stratification for sepsis, to a 90-min fluid loading protocol with either 0.9% saline or a colloid solution (gelatin, hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 or albumin). Hemodynamics, biochemical parameters and diuresis were recorded. A response was defined by an increase in diuresis of >10% during fluid loading.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Diuresis increased more during saline than colloid infusion, together with a decline in colloid osmotic pressure (COP) of plasma and less increase in plasma volume and global hemodynamics with saline, at similar fluid balance. Nine patients (82%) receiving saline had a diuretic response, compared to 13 patients (42%) receiving colloids (P = 0.04), and the response was not predicted by underlying condition, global hemodynamics, volume of fluid infused and COP.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In critically ill patients with clinical hypovolemia, diuresis increases more during saline than colloid fluid loading, only partly dependent of a fall in plasma COP."

The role of angiotensin II (ANGII) in this setting is unclear. Methods: We conducted a post hoc analysis of the Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High-Output Shock (ATHOS) 3 trial which assessed the effect of Intravenous ANG II or placebo in patients with refractory vasodilatory shock in 75 intensive care units across nine countries in North America, Australasia, and Europe. We included patients with all stages AKI at initiation of ANG II or placebo and assessed 28-day mortality as primary outcome. We studied mean arterial pressure (MAP) response and days alive and free from renal replacement therapy (RRT) up to day 7 as secondary outcome. Results: Of 321 ATHOS-3 patients, 203 (63%) had AKI at randomization, with stage 3 AKI being dominant (67%). Median age was 63 years and median APACHE II score was 30. By day 28, overall, 118 (58%) of patients had died (53% with ANGII vs. 63% with placebo, hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI [0.52-1.08], P = 0.121). Among AKI stage 3 patients, however, ANGII was associated with significantly lower mortality (48% vs. 67%, hazard ratio = 0.57, 95% CI [0.36-0.91], P = 0.024). Additionally, in this subgroup, compared with placebo, patients receiving ANGII were more likely to achieve a MAP response (P < 0.001) and had more days alive and free from RRT (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Compared with placebo, in patients with catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock and stage 3 AKI, ANGII is associated with lower 28-day, greater likelihood of MAP response, and more days alive and free from RRT. These findings support the conduct of future ANGII trials in patients with stage 3 AKI."
Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy with Gemcitabine plus Cisplatin in Patients with Locally Advanced Bladder Cancer.,"Dora Niedersüss-Beke, Thomas Puntus, Thomas Kunit, Birgit Grünberger, Michael Lamche, Wolfgang Loidl, Reinhard Böhm, Nicole Kraischits, Stefan Kudlacek, Paul Schramek, Johannes G Meran, Dora Niedersüss-Bekeet al.",2017,Oncology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28399521/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with methotrexate-vinblastine-doxorubicin-cisplatin (MVAC) is the standard of care for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) shows similar efficacy with less toxicity in the metastatic setting and has therefore often been used interchangeably with MVAC. We report on the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant GC in patients with locally advanced urothelial cancer.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We prospectively evaluated 87 patients in 2 centers. Their median age was 68 years. Treatment consisted of 3× GC prior to radical cystectomy. The primary endpoint was pathologic response. The secondary endpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In all, 83 patients finished chemotherapy; 80 patients were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Pathologic complete response (pCR) was achieved in 22.5% and near pCR was seen in 33.7% of the patients. The 1-year PFS rate was 79.5% among those patients achieving ≤pT2 versus 100% among those patients achieving pCR or near pCR (p = 0.041). Five-year OS was 61.8% (95% CI 67.6 to NA). GC was well tolerated. Grade 3/4 toxicities occurred in 38% of the patients. There was no grade 3/4 renal toxicity, febrile neutropenia, or death.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Neoadjuvant GC is a well-tolerated regimen. Although the pathologic response is lower than that reported with MVAC, our data support GC as a feasible option in the absence of a prospective randomized comparison, particularly for older patients, since its toxicity is lower than that of MVAC."
Modification of the effects of intensive systolic blood pressure control on kidney outcomes by baseline body mass index.,"Adhish Agarwal, Guo Wei, Robert Boucher, Faris Ahmed, Srinivasan Beddhu, Adhish Agarwalet al.",2021 Apr,Nephrology (Carlton),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33538091/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      Obesity and intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) control are independently associated with greater risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and incident chronic kidney disease (CKD). We examined whether baseline body mass index (BMI) modifies the effects of intensive SBP lowering on AKI or incident CKD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) randomized 9361 participants with high blood pressure to an SBP target of either <120 mm Hg or < 140 mm Hg. In a secondary analysis of 9210 SPRINT participants with a baseline BMI of ≥18.5 and < 50 kg/m2 , we examined the interactions of baseline BMI and SPRINT SBP intervention on subsequent AKI and incident CKD.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Each 5 kg/m2 increase in baseline BMI was associated with higher risk of AKI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.25) and incident CKD (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32). Intensive SBP control increased the risk of AKI (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.22-2.11) and incident CKD (HR 3.49, 95% CI 2.47-4.94). The increased risk of AKI with intensive SBP control was consistent across the baseline BMI spectrum (linear interaction p = 0.55); however, the risk of incident CKD with SPRINT intervention increased with higher BMI (linear interaction p = 0.043).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The increased risk of adverse kidney events seen with intensive SBP control in the SPRINT persisted across the baseline BMI spectrum. A higher baseline BMI was associated with an augmented risk of incident CKD with intensive SBP control."
A randomised feasibility study to assess a novel strategy to rationalise fluid in patients after cardiac surgery.,"R L Parke, S P McGuinness, E Gilder, L W McCarthy, K-A L Cowdrey, R L Parkeet al.",2015 Jul,Br J Anaesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25991758/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      After cardiac surgery, patients receive large amounts of fluid in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We plan to conduct a multi-centre randomised controlled trial, of a conservative fluid regime, in patients after cardiac surgery, and have reported results of a feasibility study that evaluated efficacy and safety of the proposed regime.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      After ethical approval, a single-centre, prospectively randomised interventional study was undertaken. Participants were randomised to either usual care, or to a protocolised algorithm, utilising stroke volume variation, to guide fluid administration to patients who were deemed to have inadequate cardiac output and were likely to be volume responsive. The study protocol lasted from ICU admission to de-sedation or 24 h, whichever occurred first.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We randomised 144 subjects over 9 months. Less bolus fluid and less total overall fluid volume was administered in the intervention group (median (IQR) 1620 ml (500-3410) and 2525 ml (1440-5250; P<0.001), compared with the usual care group (2050 ml (910-4280) and 2980 ml (2070-6580; P=0.001), from ICU admission to extubation. There was no significant difference in incidence of acute kidney injury or the average amount of fluid administered to the usual care group at the beginning compared with the end of the study.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      It is both possible and safe to achieve a significant reduction in the amount of fluid administered to patients, allocated to a conservative fluid protocol. These results suggest that a planned multi-centre study is both justified and feasible.

Guidewire exchange vs new site placement for temporary dialysis catheter insertion in ICU patients: is there a greater risk of colonization or dysfunction?,"Elisabeth Coupez, Jean-François Timsit, Stéphane Ruckly, Carole Schwebel, Didier Gruson, Emmanuel Canet, Kada Klouche, Laurent Argaud, Julien Bohe, Maïté Garrouste-Orgeas, Christophe Mariat, François Vincent, Sophie Cayot, Olivier Cointault, Alain Lepape, Michael Darmon, Alexandre Boyer, Elie Azoulay, Lila Bouadma, Alexandre Lautrette, Bertrand Souweine, Elisabeth Coupezet al.",2016 Jul 30,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27473868/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intensive care unit (ICU) patients require dialysis catheters (DCs) for renal replacement therapy (RRT). They carry a high risk of developing end-stage renal disease, and therefore their vascular access must be preserved. Guidewire exchange (GWE) is often used to avoid venipuncture insertion (VPI) at a new site. However, the impact of GWE on infection and dysfunction of DCs in the ICU is unknown. Our aim was to compare the effect of GWE and VPI on DC colonization and dysfunction in ICU patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using data from the ELVIS randomized controlled trial (RCT) (1496 ICU adults requiring DC for RRT or plasma exchange) we performed a matched-cohort analysis. Cases were DCs inserted by GWE (n = 178). They were matched with DCs inserted by VPI. Matching criteria were participating centre, simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II +/-10, insertion site (jugular or femoral), side for jugular site, and length of ICU stay before DC placement. We used a marginal Cox model to estimate the effect of DC insertion (GWE vs. VPI) on DC colonization and dysfunction.
    


          Results:
        
      
      DC colonization rate was not different between GWE-DCs and VPI-DCs (10 (5.6 %) for both groups) but DC dysfunction was more frequent with GWE-DCs (67 (37.6 %) vs. 28 (15.7 %); hazard ratio (HR), 3.67 (2.07-6.49); p < 0.01). Results were similar if analysis was restricted to DCs changed for dysfunction.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      GWE for DCs in ICU patients, compared with VPI did not contribute to DC colonization or infection but was associated with more than twofold increase in DC dysfunction.

      Evidence is lacking on the best standard method for forced diuresis to prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. We compared the cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity prevention effect of furosemide or mannitol in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer suitable to receive cisplatin-containing regimen were randomly assigned to receive furosemide or mannitol with appropriate hydration. The primary endpoint was the proportion of ≥ grade 1 serum creatinine elevation in the first cycle.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial was terminated early with 44 (22 per arm) of the planned 66 patients because of slow accrual. Patients' characteristics were well balanced with median baseline creatinine clearance of 98.0 and 95.1 mL/min in the furosemide and mannitol arms, respectively. In the first cycle, two (9%) and four (18%) patients developed grade 1 creatinine elevation (P = .66), respectively, despite no ≥ grade 2 toxicity. The median times to develop the worst creatinine score were 10 and 8 days, respectively. For all cycles, median times to recover to grade 0 were 56 and 20 days, respectively. The furosemide arm was characterized by relatively high urine output after cisplatin administration (900 vs 550 mL/h), low frequency of unplanned additional hydration (14% vs 32%), and high incidence of hyponatremia (18% and 5%) compared with the mannitol arm. Both arms showed similar progression-free survival and overall survival.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The preventive effect of the two forced diuretics on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity was not significantly different. However, the two diuretics have some distinct types of clinical presentations."
A randomized double blinded placebo controlled trial of sildenafil for renoprotection prior to hilar clamping in patients undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.,"Louis S Krane, Charles C Peyton, Michael A Olympio, Ashok K Hemal, Louis S Kraneet al.",2016 Dec,J Surg Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27613357/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To perform a randomized control trial (RCT) assessing the effect of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) used prior to hilar clamping during robot assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) for renoprotection.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We performed an institutional review board approved, placebo controlled, double blinded RCT evaluating a single 100 mg oral dose of sildenafil immediately prior to RAPN. Primary end point was accrual, participation and retention of patients with secondary endpoints assessing post-operative renal functional outcomes and safety. Exclusion criteria included history of coronary artery disease, solitary kidney, suspected benign pathology, PDE5i intolerance or pregnant females.

      Of 40 eligible consecutive patients undergoing RPN between 9/2013 and 12/2014, 30 (75%) were randomized to treatment and there was 100% participation and retention. The groups were well matched for all measured comorbidities. Intraoperative outcomes including warm ischemia time (median 15 vs. 16.5 min, P = 0.29) were similar. Change in eGFR demonstrated similar decrease between sildenafil versus placebo at 1 day (-8% vs. -10%, P = 0.53), 2 days (-9% vs. -9%, P = 0.77), and 1 month (-4% vs. -6%, P = 0.31) following RAPN. Intermediate follow up (median 183 days) demonstrated similar results (-8% vs. -1%, P = 0.16) between the two cohorts. Safety profiles were similar between the two cohorts without any adverse reactions to the sildenafil.

"Nicotinamide riboside with pterostilbene (NRPT) increases NAD(+) in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stepwise safety study of escalating doses of NRPT in patients with AKI.","Petra Simic, Xavier Fernando Vela Parada, Samir M Parikh, Ryan Dellinger, Leonard P Guarente, Eugene P Rhee, Petra Simicet al.",2020 Aug 13,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32791973/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Preclinical studies have identified both NAD+ and sirtuin augmentation as potential strategies for the prevention and treatment of AKI. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a NAD+ precursor vitamin and pterostilbene (PT) is potent sirtuin activator found in blueberries. Here, we tested the effect of combined NR and PT (NRPT) on whole blood NAD+ levels and safety parameters in patients with AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of escalating doses of NRPT in 24 hospitalized patients with AKI. The study was comprised of four Steps during which NRPT (5 subjects) or placebo (1 subject) was given twice a day for 2 days. NRPT dosing was increased in each Step: Step 1250/50 mg, Step 2500/100 mg, Step 3750/150 mg and Step 41,000/200 mg. Blood NAD+ levels were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and safety was assessed by history, physical exam, and clinical laboratory testing.
    


          Results:
        
      
      AKI resulted in a 50% reduction in whole blood NAD+ levels at 48 h compared to 0 h in patients receiving placebo (p = 0.05). There was a trend for increase in NAD+ levels in all NRPT Steps individually at 48 h compared to 0 h, but only the change in Step 2 reached statistical significance (47%, p = 0.04), and there was considerable interindividual variability in the NAD+ response to treatment. Considering all Steps together, NRPT treatment increased NAD+ levels by 37% at 48 h compared to 0 h (p = 0.002). All safety laboratory tests were unchanged by NRPT treatment, including creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), electrolytes, liver function tests, and blood counts. Three of 20 patients receiving NRPT reported minor gastrointestinal side effects.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      NRPT increases whole blood NAD+ levels in hospitalized patients with AKI. In addition, NRPT up to a dose of 1000 mg/200 mg twice a day for 2 days is safe and well tolerated in these patients. Further studies to assess the potential therapeutic benefit of NRPT in AKI are warranted.

Phase I study of combined indomethacin and platinum-based chemotherapy to reduce platinum-induced fatty acids.,"Daphne L van der Velden, Geert A Cirkel, Julia M Houthuijzen, E van Werkhoven, Jeanine M L Roodhart, Laura G M Daenen, Sovann Kaing, Johan Gerrits, Nanda M Verhoeven-Duif, Cecile Grootscholten, Henk Boot, Cristisiana Sessa, Haiko J Bloemendal, Filip Y De Vos, Emile E Voest, Daphne L van der Veldenet al.",2018 May,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29574584/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Chemotherapy-resistance remains a major obstacle to effective anti-cancer treatment. We previously showed that platinum analogs cause the release of two fatty acids. These platinum-induced fatty acids (PIFAs) induced complete chemoresistance in mice, whereas co-administration of a COX-1 inhibitor, indomethacin, prevented PIFA release and significantly enhanced chemosensitivity. To assess the safety of combining indomethacin with platinum-based chemotherapy, and to explore its efficacy and associated PIFA levels, a multi-center phase I trial was conducted.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was comprised of two arms: oxaliplatin plus capecitabine (CAPOX, arm I) and cisplatin plus gemcitabine, capecitabine or 5FU (arm II) in patients for whom these regimens were indicated as standard care. Indomethacin was escalated from 25 to 75 mg TID, using a standard 3 × 3 design per arm, and was administered orally 8 days around chemo-infusion from cycle two onwards. PIFA levels were measured before and after treatment initiation, with and without indomethacin.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirteen patients were enrolled, of which ten were evaluable for safety analyses. In arm I, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and all indomethacin dose levels were well-tolerated. Partial responses were observed in three patients (30%). Indomethacin lowered plasma levels of 12-S-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (12-S-HHT), whereas 4,7,10,13-hexadecatetraenoic acid (16:4(n-3)) levels were not affected. Only one patient was included in arm II; renal toxicity led to closure of this cohort.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Combined indomethacin and CAPOX treatment is safe and reduces the concentrations of 12-S-HHT, which may be associated with improved chemosensitivity. The recommended phase II dose is 75 mg indomethacin TID given 8 days surrounding standard dosed CAPOX."
Renal safety of lithium in HIV-infected patients established on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate containing antiretroviral therapy: analysis from a randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"Eric H Decloedt, Maia Lesosky, Gary Maartens, John A Joska, Eric H Decloedtet al.",2017 Feb 4,AIDS Res Ther,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28160772/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The prevalence of bipolar disorder in HIV-infected patients is higher than the general population. Lithium is the most effective mood stabiliser, while tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is frequently used as part of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both TDF and lithium are associated with renal tubular toxicity, which could be additive, or a pharmacokinetic interaction may occur at renal transporters with a decrease in TDF elimination.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We report on the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the modification of diet in renal disease formula in participants who received ART including TDF and were enrolled in a 24 week randomised trial of lithium versus placebo in patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We included HIV-infected adults with cognitive impairment established on ART for at least 6 months with a suppressed viral load attending public sector ART clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. We excluded participants with an eGFR <60 mL/min and treated with medications predisposing to lithium toxicity. We reviewed participants weekly for the first month for adverse events followed by 4 weekly visits for renal function assessment, adverse event monitoring and adherence. Lithium dose was titrated to achieve the maintenance target plasma concentration of between 0.6 and 1.0 mmol/L. Sham lithium concentrations were generated for participants receiving placebo.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We included 23 participants allocated to the lithium arm and 30 participants allocated to the placebo arm. Baseline characteristics were not statistically different with a mean age of 37.7 and 40.8 years, a median time on ART of 33 and 40 months and an eGFR of 139.3 and 131.0 mL/min in the lithium and placebo arms respectively. There was no statistical significant difference in the reduction in eGFR or increase in potassium between the two arms during the 24 weeks.

Intravenous magnesium sulfate: new method in prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in primary percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Ata Firouzi, Mohsen Maadani, Reza Kiani, Farshad Shakerian, Hamid Reza Sanati, Ali Zahedmehr, Seyedabbas Nabavi, Mona Heidarali, Ata Firouziet al.",2015 Mar,Int Urol Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25475196/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is an adverse consequence of percutaneous coronary interventions which results in significant morbidity and mortality and adds to the costs of diagnostic and interventional cardiology procedures. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed for CI-AKI and various agents tested for its prevention. There is currently a general agreement that adequate pre-procedural hydration constitutes the cornerstone of prevention, yet there are reports of the use of some other agents with various efficacies. We prospectively tested IV magnesium sulfate (Mg) for CI-AKI prevention.
    


          Method and design:
        
      
      This study is a prospective, randomized, open-labeled, single-center clinical trial. We randomly assigned 122 consecutive patients to two groups. The first group was the control group with routine treatment (n = 64), and second group was the study group with routine treatment plus IV magnesium sulfate 1 g just before the procedure (n = 62). Serum creatinine was measured before the procedure and 2 days after the procedure. The primary end point was the occurrence of CI-AKI within 48 h. CI-AKI was defined as 0.5 mg/dl or more increase in serum creatinine or 25% or more increase above baseline serum creatinine. There was no difference in definition if both of these parameters were present.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The control and study groups were comparable in the overall predicted risk of CI-AKI. Also, the type and volume of the contrast were not significantly different between the two groups. Following angioplasty, CI-AKI occurred in 17 (26.6%) patients in the control group and nine (14.5%) patients in the study group; there was a significant reduction in CI-AKI in the study group (P = 0.01). Additionally, there was no mortality or a need for hemodialysis in either group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In primary PCI patients, the prophylactic use of intravenous Mg can be recommended to be added to traditional hydration for CI-AKI prevention."
Chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide after high-dose methotrexate for primary CNS lymphoma: a multicenter phase I study of a response-adapted strategy.,"Silvia Chiesa, Stefan Hohaus, Lorenzo Falcinelli, Francesco D'Alò, Massimo Fabrizio Martelli, Stefania Manfrida, Francesco Beghella Bartoli, Cesare Colosimo, Vincenzo Valentini, Cynthia Aristei, Mario Balducci, Silvia Chiesaet al.",2020 Oct,Ann Hematol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32816079/,"CNS lymphoma, Chemoradiotherapy, Phase I study, Temozolomide.","This study aimed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of temozolomide (TMZ) concurrent with radiotherapy (RT) after high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) for newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Adult patients with PCNSL were treated according to a response-adapted strategy. HD-MTX (3.5 g/m2) was followed by concomitant RT and escalating TMZ (50-60-75 mg/m2/day, 5 days/week). The total radiation dose was modulated according to the patient's response to HD-MTX. All patients received 30 Gy to the whole brain plus leptomeninges to C2, including the third posterior of the orbital cavity (clinical target volume 2; CTV2), plus 6, 10, or 16 Gy to the primary site, including the residual mass (CTV1), if a complete response (CR), partial response (PR)/stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) was observed, respectively. Acute toxicities were graded according to the RTOG-EORTC criteria. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 4 hematological toxicity or grade 3-4 hepatic toxicity, although 75 mg/m2/day was the maximum dose regardless of DLT. Neurocognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Three patients were enrolled at each TMZ dose level (total = 9 patients). Twelve lesions were treated. Six patients received 2 cycles of HD-MTX, while 3 received only 1 cycle because of hepatic or renal toxicity. All patients completed chemoradiotherapy without interruptions. No DLT events were recorded. TMZ appears to be tolerable at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day when administered concomitantly with radiotherapy and after HD-MTX."
"A prospective, randomized, comparison study on effect of perioperative use of chloride liberal intravenous fluids versus chloride restricted intravenous fluids on postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries.","K Bhaskaran, Ganapathy Arumugam, P V Vinay Kumar, K Bhaskaranet al.",2018 Oct-Dec,Ann Card Anaesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30333337/,No keywords found,"Context and aims:
        
      
      Off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCABG) is a form of CABG surgery. It is performed without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass machine as a surgical treatment for coronary heart disease. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the common postoperative complications of OPCABG. Previous studies suggest important differences related to intravenous fluid (IVF) chloride content and renal function. We hypothesize that perioperative use of chloride restricted IVFs may decrease incidence and severity of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing OPCABG.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Six hundred patients were randomly divided into two groups of 300 each. In Group A (n = 300), chloride liberal IVFs, namely, hydroxyethyl starch (130/0.4) in 0.9% normal saline (Voluven), 0.9% normal saline, and Ringer's lactate were used for perioperative fluid management. In Group B (n = 300), chloride-restricted IVFs, namely, hydroxyethyl starch (130/0.4) in balanced colloid solution (Volulyte) and balanced salt crystalloid solution (PlasmaLyte A), were used for perioperative fluid management. Serum creatinine values were taken preoperatively, postoperatively at 24 h and at 48 h. Postoperative AKI was determined by AKI network (AKIN) criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In Group A, 9.2% patients and in Group B 4.6% patients developed Stage-I AKI determined by AKIN criteria which was statistically significant (P < 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Perioperative use of chloride restricted IVF was found to decrease incidence of postoperative AKI. The use of chloride liberal IVF was associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis."
"N-acetylcysteine plus deferoxamine for patients with prolonged hypotension does not decrease acute kidney injury incidence: a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Cassiana Mazon Fraga, Cristiane Damiani Tomasi, Danusa de Castro Damasio, Francieli Vuolo, Cristiane Ritter, Felipe Dal-Pizzol, Cassiana Mazon Fragaet al.",2016 Oct 17,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27745551/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The aim was to test the primary hypothesis that in patients suffering from shock, treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) plus deferoxamine (DFX) decreases the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a general intensive care unit in an academic hospital. Patients were included if they had new-onset hypotension, defined as mean arterial blood pressure <60 mmHg or requirement for vasopressor medication. A loading dose of NAC or placebo of 50 mg/kg in 4 h was administered intravenously. After the loading dose, patients received 100 mg/kg/day for the next 48 h. DFX or placebo was administered once at 1000 mg at a rate of 15/mg/kg/h. The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 80 patients were enrolled in the study. The incidence of AKI was 67 % in the placebo arm and 65 % in the treatment group (relative risk (RR) 0.89 (0.35-2.2)). Furthermore, NAC plus DFX was effective in decreasing the severity and duration of AKI, and patients in the treatment group had lower serum creatinine levels at discharge. No severe adverse event associated with treatment was reported. The effects of NAC plus DFX could be secondary to the attenuation of early inflammatory response and oxidative damage.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The administration of NAC plus DFX to critically ill patients who had a new episode of hypotension did not decrease the incidence of AKI.

EURO-B.O.S.S.: A European study on chemotherapy in bone-sarcoma patients aged over 40: Outcome in primary high-grade osteosarcoma.,"Stefano Ferrari, Stefan S Bielack, Sigbjørn Smeland, Alessandra Longhi, Gerlinde Egerer, Kirsten Sundby Hall, Davide Donati, Matthias Kevric, Otte Brosjö, Alessandro Comandone, Mathias Werner, Odd Monge, Emanuela Palmerini, Wolfgang E Berdel, Bodil Bjerkehagen, Anna Paioli, Sylvie Lorenzen, Mikael Eriksson, Marco Gambarotti, Per-Ulf Tunn, Nina L Jebsen, Marilena Cesari, Thekla von Kalle, Virginia Ferraresi, Rudolf Schwarz, Rossella Bertulli, Anne-Katrin Kasparek, Giovanni Grignani, Fatime Krasniqi, Benjamin Sorg, Stefanie Hecker-Nolting, Piero Picci, Peter Reichardt, Stefano Ferrariet al.",2018 Jan-Feb,Tumori,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29218692/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      The EUROpean Bone Over 40 Sarcoma Study (EURO-B.O.S.S.) was the first prospective international study for patients 41-65 years old with high-grade bone sarcoma treated with an intensive chemotherapy regimen derived from protocols for younger patients with high-grade skeletal osteosarcoma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Chemotherapy based on doxorubicin, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and methotrexate was suggested, but patients treated with other regimens at the investigators' choice were also eligible for the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The present report focuses on the subgroup of 218 patients with primary high-grade osteosarcoma. With a median follow-up of 47 months, the 5-year probability of overall survival (OS) was 66% in patients with localized disease and 22% in case of synchronous metastases. The 5-year OS in patients with localized disease was 29% in pelvic tumors, and 70% and 73% for extremity or craniofacial locations, respectively. In primary chemotherapy, tumor necrosis ≥90% was reported in 21% of the patients. There were no toxic deaths; however, hematological toxicity was considerable with 32% of patients experiencing 1 or more episodes of neutropenic fever. The incidence of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity (mainly peripheral) was 28% and 24%, respectively. After methotrexate, 23% of patients experienced delayed excretion, in 4 cases with nephrotoxicity.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients over 40 years of age with primary high-grade osteosarcoma, an aggressive approach with chemotherapy and surgery can offer the probability of survival similar to that achieved in younger patients. Chemotherapy-related toxicity is significant and generally higher than that reported in younger cohorts of osteosarcoma patients treated with more intensive regimens."
A randomised controlled trial of rosuvastatin for the prevention of aminoglycoside-induced kidney toxicity in children with cystic fibrosis.,"Stephen J McWilliam, Anna Rosala-Hallas, Ashley P Jones, Victoria Shaw, William Greenhalf, Thomas Jaki, Alan R Smyth, Rosalind L Smyth, Munir Pirmohamed, Stephen J McWilliamet al.",2020 Feb 4,Sci Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32020028/,No keywords found,"The PROteKT study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin can inhibit aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity in children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). This open label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial recruited children and young people aged 6 to 18 years with CF at 13 paediatric CF treatment centres in the UK. Participants were randomised equally to either receive oral rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily) or no intervention (control) throughout clinically indicated treatment with intravenous tobramycin. The primary outcome was the difference between the groups in mean fold-change in urinary Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1). Fifty (rosuvastatin n = 23, control n = 27) participants were recruited between May 2015 and January 2017. Primary outcome data was available for 88% (rosuvastatin n = 20, control n = 24). The estimated mean treatment difference in the geometric mean-fold change of normalised KIM-1 was 1.08 (95% CI 0.87-1.35, p = 0.48). In total there were 12 adverse reactions, all mild, reported by five participants randomised to rosuvastatin, and one serious adverse event in each group. Whilst no protective effect of rosuvastatin was seen, there was a lower than expected level of nephrotoxicity in the cohort. Therefore, we can neither confirm nor refute the hypothesis that rosuvastatin protects against aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity."
Assessment of Risk of Harm Associated With Intensive Blood Pressure Management Among Patients With Hypertension Who Smoke: A Secondary Analysis of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.,"Joseph Scarpa, Emilie Bruzelius, Patrick Doupe, Matthew Le, James Faghmous, Aaron Baum, Joseph Scarpaet al.",2019 Mar 1,JAMA Netw Open,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30848803/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      The randomized Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed that lowering systolic blood pressure targets for adults with hypertension reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in general. However, whether the overall benefit from intensive blood pressure control masks important heterogeneity in risk is unknown.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To test the hypothesis that the overall benefit observed in SPRINT masked important heterogeneity in risk from intensive blood pressure control.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      In this exploratory, hypothesis-generating, ad hoc, secondary analysis of data obtained from 9361 participants in SPRINT, a random forest-based analysis was used to identify potential heterogeneous treatment effects using half of the trial data. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to test potential heterogeneous treatment effects on the remaining data. The original trial was conducted at 102 sites in the United States between November 2010 and March 2013. This analysis was conducted between November 2016 and August 2017.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants were assigned a systolic blood pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg (intervention treatment) or of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment).
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary composite cardiovascular outcome was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 9361 participants in SPRINT, 466 participants (5.0%) were current smokers with systolic blood pressure greater than 144 mm Hg at baseline, with 230 participants (49.4%) randomized to the training data set and 236 participants (50.6%) randomized to the testing data set; 286 participants (61.4%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 60.7 (7.2) years. Combinations of 2 covariates (ie, baseline smoking status and systolic blood pressure) distinguished participants who were differentially affected by the intervention. In the testing data, Cox proportional hazards models for the primary outcome revealed a number needed to harm of 43.7 to cause 1 event across 3.3 years among participants who, at baseline, were current smokers with systolic blood pressure greater than 144 mm Hg (10.9% [12 of 110] of primary outcome events for intervention treatment vs 4.8% [6 of 126] for standard treatment; hazard ratio, 10.6; 95% CI, 1.3-86.1; P = .03). This subgroup was also associated with a higher likelihood to experience acute kidney injury under intensive blood pressure control (with a frequency of 10.0% [11 of 110] of acute kidney injury events for intervention treatment vs 3.2% [4 of 126] for standard treatment; hazard ratio, 9.4; 95% CI, 1.2-77.3; P = .04).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      In this secondary analysis of SPRINT data, current smokers with a baseline systolic blood pressure greater than 144 mm Hg had a higher rate of cardiovascular events in the intensive treatment group vs the standard treatment group. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential tradeoffs of intensive blood pressure control in hypertensive smokers."
The effect of curcumin in prevention of contrast nephropathy following coronary angiography or angioplasty in CKD patients.,"Maryam Hami, Amir Bigdeli, Ramin Khameneh Bagheri, Omid Rajabi, Maryam Salehi, Farnaz Zahedi Avval, Maryam Hamiet al.",2019 Sep,Iran J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31705746/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is the most common cause of iatrogenic acute kidney injury. It is happened more commonly in patients with underlying kidney diseases. It is appeared that the oxidative stress is the main mechanism of contrast nephropathy. Curcumin is suggested as an herbal antioxidant agent, so we decided to assess the effect of curcumin in preventing of this complication in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD) who need coronary angiography.
    


          Methods and materials:
        
      
      We conducted double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 60 moderate to severe CKD patients who underwent coronary angiography or angioplasty. Adjusted dose of Iodixanol was used as contrast agent in all of them. Curcumin or placebo administered orally, 1.5 g daily from 2 days before procedure to 3 days after it. CIN was defined by an increased serum creatinine level≥0.3mg/dl or an increase to ≥1.5 times of the baseline within 48 hours after procedure. Urinary NGAL test was also done the next day after angiography.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CIN occurred in 12(20%) of patients, 5(16.7%) in Curcumin group and 7(23.3%) in placebo group (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 2.36; P0.51). Serum Creatinine was increased after72 hours of intervention from 1.65±0.26 mg/dl to 1.79±0.33 mg/dl in Curcumin group and from 1.61±0.23 mg/dl to 1.86±0.35 in placebo group. There is no significant difference between the mean increase in serum creatinine concentration in the placebo group and Curcumin group (difference of 0.006 mg/dL; 95% CI, - 0.06 to 0.08; P0.85). Urinary NGAL test was significantly higher in patients with AKI (p=0.000), but there weren't differences in its level in two groups (p=0.761) Conclusion: It is appeared prophylactic oral Curcumin hasn't protective effects on CIN in high risk patients who have undergone coronary procedure."
Prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy with single bolus erythropoietin in patients with diabetic kidney disease: A randomized controlled trial.,"Lilach Shema-Didi, Batya Kristal, Sarit Eizenberg, Nabil Marzuq, Majdy Sussan, Yulie Feldman-Idov, Pnina Ofir, Shaul Atar, Lilach Shema-Didiet al.",2016 Apr,Nephrology (Carlton),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26370061/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      Contrast-induced-nephropathy (CIN) is associated with poor outcomes, thus prevention of CIN may be of clinical value. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to elicit tissue-protective effects in experimental models and in clinical studies of acute kidney injury. We therefore evaluated its effectiveness for prevention of CIN after coronary angiography (CA) ± percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was carried out in 138 diabetic patients with eGFR <60 mL/min who underwent non-urgent CA ± PCI. Patients received normal saline and n-acetyl cysteine before CA, with or without 50,000 U of EPO administered 30 min prior to CA. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.5 mg/dL during the first 2 days after exposure to contrast media. Primary outcome was the incidence of CIN. Secondary outcomes were the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of Cystatin C (CC) and Neutrophil-gelatinase-associated-lipocalin (NGAL) for diagnosis of CIN.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The observed incidence of CIN was 8.7%, significantly lower than the expected for such high-risk population. The administration of EPO prior to CA did not reduce the incidence of CIN (9.7% vs. 7.6%, P = 0.65). CC and NGAL demonstrated a low sensitivity (16.6%) and low PPV (6.7 and 33.3%, respectively) for detecting CIN.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The administration of EPO prior to CA did not reduce the incidence of CIN. Additional prospective research with a larger sample size and in other patient categories is essential to further define the potential protective effect of EPO on prevention of CIN."
Safety and efficacy of the early introduction of everolimus with reduced-exposure cyclosporine a in de novo kidney recipients.,"Chang-Kwon Oh, Kyu Ha Huh, Jongwon Ha, Yeong Hoon Kim, Yong-Lim Kim, Yu Seun Kim, Chang-Kwon Ohet al.",2015 Jan,Transplantation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24983307/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Everolimus and cyclosporine A (CsA) exhibit synergistic immunosuppressive activity when used in combination. We examined the safety and efficacy of the use of everolimus with a cyclosporine-sparing strategy in de novo renal transplant recipients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comparative, parallel, randomized, open-label 1-year study has been performed in 148 patients from five transplant centers to compare the efficacy and tolerability of everolimus and reduced exposure CsA (the investigational group) or enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium and standard-exposure CsA (the control group) in combination with basiliximab and steroids. The eligible subjects were randomly assigned at 1 month after transplantation. Efficacy failure (biopsy-proven acute rejection, death, graft loss, or loss to follow-up), safety, and renal function were evaluated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One graft loss has been reported in the control group and no patient death were reported in either group. The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection until 12 months after transplantation of the investigational group was 7.5%, compared to 11.1% of the control group (P=0.565). The mean estimated glomerular filtration rates of the investigational group at 12 months after transplantation was significantly higher (68.1 ± 16.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) than that of the control group (60.6 ± 15.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2); P=0.016). There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the incidence of discontinuations and serious adverse events between the groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results of this study provide the evidences that (1) the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) minimization by the introduction of everolimus after 1-month posttransplantation keeps the incidences of acute rejection and additional risks as low as the conventional immunosuppression; (2) it allows minimizing CNI exposure, consequently reducing CNI nephrotoxicity and preserving renal function."
Inhaled nitric oxide as adjunctive therapy for severe malaria: a randomized controlled trial.,"Michael T Hawkes, Andrea L Conroy, Robert O Opoka, Laura Hermann, Kevin E Thorpe, Chloe McDonald, Hani Kim, Sarah Higgins, Sophie Namasopo, Chandy John, Chris Miller, W Conrad Liles, Kevin C Kain, Michael T Hawkeset al.",2015 Oct 29:14:421.,Malar J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510464/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Severe malaria remains a major cause of childhood mortality globally. Decreased endothelial nitric oxide is associated with severe and fatal malaria. The hypothesis was that adjunctive inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) would improve outcomes in African children with severe malaria.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of iNO at 80 ppm by non-rebreather mask versus room air placebo as adjunctive treatment to artesunate in children with severe malaria was conducted. The primary outcome was the longitudinal course of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), an endothelial biomarker of malaria severity and clinical outcome.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred and eighty children were enrolled; 88 were assigned to iNO and 92 to placebo (all received IV artesunate). Ang-2 levels measured over the first 72 h of hospitalization were not significantly different between groups. The mortality at 48 h was similar between groups [6/87 (6.9 %) in the iNO group vs 8/92 (8.7 %) in the placebo group; OR 0.78, 95 % CI 0.26-2.3; p = 0.65]. Clinical recovery times and parasite clearance kinetics were similar (p > 0.05). Methaemoglobinaemia >7 % occurred in 25 % of patients receiving iNO and resolved without sequelae. The incidence of neurologic deficits (<14 days), acute kidney injury, hypoglycaemia, anaemia, and haemoglobinuria was similar between groups (p > 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      iNO at 80 ppm administered by non-rebreather mask was safe but did not affect circulating levels of Ang-2. Alternative methods of enhancing endothelial NO bioavailability may be necessary to achieve a biological effect and improve clinical outcome.

      Nebulized antibiotics offer high efficacy due to significant local concentrations and safety with minimal blood levels. This study evaluates the efficacy and nephrotoxicity of nebulized versus IV amikacin in postcardiothoracic surgical patients with nosocomial pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Gram- negative bacilli.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Prospective, randomized, controlled study on surgical patients divided into two groups.
    


          Setting:

          Interventions:
        
      
      The first gtroup was administered IV amikacin 20 mg/kg once daily. The second group was prescribed amikacin nebulizer 400 mg twice daily. Both groups were co-administered IV piperacillin/tazobactam empirically.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Recruited patients were diagnosed by either hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia where 56 (42.1%) patients were diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, 51 (38.34%) patients were diagnosed with early ventilator-associated pneumonia, and 26 (19.54%) patients with late ventilator-associated pneumonia.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Clinical cure in both groups assessed on day 7 of treatment was the primary outcome. Efficacy was additionally evaluated through assessing the length of hospital stay, ICU stay, days on amikacin, days on mechanical ventilator, mechanical ventilator-free days, days to reach clinical cure, and mortality rate. Lower nephrotoxicity in the nebulized group was observed through significant preservation of kidney function (p < 0.001). Although both groups were comparable regarding length of hospital stay, nebulizer group showed shorter ICU stay (p = 0.010), lower number of days to reach complete clinical cure (p = 0.001), fewer days on mechanical ventilator (p = 0.035), and fewer days on amikacin treatment (p = 0.022).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Nebulized amikacin showed better clinical cure rates, less ICU stay, and fewer days to reach complete recovery compared to IV amikacin for surgical patients with nosocomial pneumonia. It is also a less nephrotoxic option associated with less deterioration in kidney function."
A Simulated Application of the Hartford Hospital Aminoglycoside Dosing Nomogram for Plazomicin Dosing Interval Selection in Patients With Serious Infections Caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacterales.,"Tomefa E Asempa, Joseph L Kuti, Julie D Seroogy, Allison S Komirenko, David P Nicolau, Tomefa E Asempaet al.",2019 Aug,Clin Ther,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31248681/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      In the Phase III Study of Plazomicin Compared With Colistin in Patients With Infection Due to Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CARE), plazomicin was studied for the treatment of critically ill patients with infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. Initial plazomicin dosing was guided by creatinine clearance (CrCl) and subsequent doses adjusted by therapeutic drug monitoring to achieve AUC0-24 exposures within a target range (210-315 mg∙h/L). We applied the Hartford nomogram to evaluate whether this clinical tool could reduce plazomicin troughs levels and increase the proportion of patients within the target AUC range.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Thirty-seven patients enrolled in cohorts 1 or 2 of CARE were eligible for analyses. Observed 10-hour concentrations after the initial dose were plotted on the Hartford nomogram to determine an eligible dosing interval group (q24h, q36h or q48h). On the basis of baseline CrCl, a 15- or 10-mg/kg dose was simulated with the nomogram-recommended dosing interval. The proportion of patients in each dosing interval group with a trough ≥3 mg/L (trough threshold associated with serum creatinine increases ≥0.5 mg/dL in product label) was quantified. Simulated interval-normalized AUC0-24 was compared with the target AUC range.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Among the 28 patients with a CrCl ≥60 mL/min, the nomogram recommended every-24-hour dosing in 61% and an extended-interval (q36h or q48h) in 39% of patients. For patients with a CrCl ≥30-59 mL/min (n = 9), the nomogram recommended every-24-hour dosing and an extended-interval in 22% and 78% of patients, respectively. Among both renal function cohorts, exposure simulation with the nomogram significantly reduced the proportion of patients with trough concentrations ≥3 mg/L (CrCl ≥60 mL/min cohort: 91% vs 9%, P < 0.001; CrCl ≥30-59 mL/min cohort, 100% vs 0%, P < 0.001). Relative to the observed mean (SD) AUC0-24 of 309 mg∙h/mL (96 mg∙h/mL), simulation of extended intervals resulted in a mean interval-normalized AUC0-24 of 210 mg∙h/mL (40 mg∙h/mL) in all patients eligible for an extended interval, resulting in a similar proportion (49% vs 54%) of patients within the target AUC0-24 range after the first dose.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      Application of the Hartford nomogram successfully reduced the likelihood of elevated plazomicin trough concentrations while improving AUC exposures in these patients with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales infections."

      We sought to determine safety and efficacy of the AKT inhibitor, GSK2141795, combined with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib, in endometrial cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with measurable recurrent endometrial cancer were eligible. One to two prior cytotoxic regimens were allowed; prior use of a MEK or PI3K pathway inhibitor was excluded. Initial trial design consisted of a KRAS mutation stratified randomized phase II with a safety lead-in evaluating the combination. For the safety lead in, the previously recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D; trametinib 1.5 mg, GSK2141795 50 mg) was chosen for Dose Level 1 (DL1).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 26 enrolled patients, 14 were treated on DL1 and 12 were treated on DL-1 (trametinib 1.5 mg, GSK2141795 25 mg). Most common histologies were endometrioid (58%) and serous (27%). Four of 25 (16%) patients were KRAS mutant. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed during cycle 1. DL1 had 8 DLTs (hypertension (n = 2), mucositis (2), rash (2), dehydration, stroke/acute kidney injury). DL1 was deemed non-tolerable so DL-1 was explored. DL-1 had no DLTs. Sixty-five percent of patients had ≥ grade 3 toxicity. There were no responses in DL1 (0%, 90%CI 0-15%) and 1 response in DL-1 (8.3%, 90%CI 0.4-33.9%). Proportion PFS at 6 months for DL1 is 14%, and 25% for DL-1.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The combination of trametinib and GSK2141795 had high levels of toxicity in endometrial cancer at the previously RP2D but was tolerable at a reduced dose. Due to insufficient preliminary efficacy at a tolerable dose, the Phase II study was not initiated."
Clinical Study of Standard- vs Reduced-Dose Tacrolimus Combined With Generic Mycophenolate Mofetil in De Novo Kidney Transplantation: A Prospective Randomized Trial.,"Jun Bae Bang, Chang-Kwon Oh, Man Ki Ju, Sung Joo Kim, Hee Chul Yu, Su Hyung Lee, Jun Bae Banget al.",2020 Jan-Feb,Transplant Proc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898939/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The lowering of calcineurin inhibitor exposure is possibly considered as the proper strategy to prevent calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity in kidney transplant. This clinical study was designed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of reduced-dose tacrolimus with standard-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) vs standard-dose tacrolimus with reduced-dose MMF.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, and parallel-group clinical trial was conducted at 4 transplant centers in Korea. A total sample size was 108, and eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either reduced-dose tacrolimus with standard-dose MMF (the study group) or standard-dose tacrolimus with reduced-dose MMF (the control group) for 6 months in de novo kidney transplant recipients. Graft function, the incidence of efficacy failure, and adverse events were compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate at 6 months post-transplantation was 69.83 ± 16.68 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the study group and 69.92 ± 17.55 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the control group (P > .05). The overall incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection was 3.64% (n = 2) in the study group, compared to 3.77% (n = 2) in the control group (P > .05). There was no graft loss, death, or loss of follow-up in either group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In conclusion, the results suggest that tacrolimus minimization with standard-dose MMF provides adequate immunosuppression with proper renal function and similar rate of incidence of acute rejection compared with the regimen including standard-dose tacrolimus with reduced-dose MMF."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and is associated with increased risk for short- and long-term mortality. In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), forced diuresis with matched hydration has been shown to reduce the incidence of AKI by ∼50%. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether forced diuresis with matched intravenous hydration reduces AKI in patients undergoing TAVI.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Reducing Acute Kidney Injury (REDUCE-AKI) was a single-centre, prospective, randomized, double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial, designed to examine the effect of an automated matched saline infusion with urine output for the prevention of AKI in patients undergoing TAVI. A total of 136 TAVI patients were randomized, 68 in each group. Mean age was 83.9 ± 5 years and 41.2% were males. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The rate of AKI was not statistically different between the groups (25% in the active group vs. 19.1% in the sham group, P = 0.408). There was a significant increase in long-term mortality in the active group (27.9% vs. 13. 2% HR 3.744, 95% CI 1.51-9.28; P = 0.004). The study was terminated prematurely by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for futility and a possible signal of harm.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Unlike in PCI, forced diuresis with matched hydration does not prevent AKI in patients undergoing TAVI, and might be associated with increased long-term mortality. Future studies should focus on understanding the mechanisms behind these findings.

      Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), predominantly manifest as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), is the primary cause of morbidity and death after lung transplantation. We assessed the efficacy and safety of 2 de novo immunosuppression protocols to prevent BOS.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a multicenter, prospective, international, randomized (1:1) open-label superiority study of de novo enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (MPS) vs delayed-onset everolimus (RAD), both arms in combination with cyclosporine (CsA) monitored by 2-hour post-dose (C2) levels, and corticosteroids. Target C2 levels were lower in the RAD group because RAD is known to potentiate CsA nephrotoxicity. Cytolytic induction therapy was not used. Patients were stratified at entry for cystic fibrosis. Confirmation of anastomotic healing was required for randomization. Primary efficacy was freedom from BOS Grade 1 on intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Secondary efficacy parameters were patient and graft survival and severity of rejection. Treatment failure was defined by graft loss, patient death, drug cessation, or need for other therapy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The 3-year freedom from BOS Grade 1 was 70% for MPS (n = 80) vs 71% for RAD (n = 84; p = 0.95 by log-rank) in ITT but was lower in the RAD arm of the per-protocol population (p = 0.03). The 3-year survival was 84% (MPS) vs 76% (RAD; p = 0.19 by log-rank). Thirteen patients switched from MPS vs 31 from RAD (p < 0.01). Days on MPS were greater than days on RAD (p < 0.01). Rejection events proven by biopsy specimen were more common on MPS (p = 0.02), as were leucopenia (p < 0.01), diarrhea (p < 0.01), and cytomegalovirus infection (p = 0.04). Venous thromboembolism was more frequent on RAD (p = 0.02). Creatinine at 3 years was 160 ± 112 μmol/1iter in MPS patients vs 152 ± 98 μmol/1iter in RAD patients (p = 0.67).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This 3-year ITT analysis found no significant difference between arms but was underpowered to accept the null hypothesis that RAD and MPS have equivalent efficacy in preventing BOS or death after lung transplantation."

Monthly zoledronic acid (ZOL) reduces skeletal complications; however, limited data are available regarding long-term safety. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of ZOL beyond 1 year of treatment. We prospectively evaluated 73 patients; breast cancer (n = 29), castrate-resistant prostate cancer (n = 13), multiple myeloma (n = 31) from 2006 to 2008 in 19 cancer centres. All patients were diagnosed with bone disease and had completed 1-2 years of monthly ZOL (4 mg) and received a further 1-2 years of therapy following contemporary guidelines for managing risks of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and renal toxicity. Overall rates of skeletal-related events (SREs), renal impairment and ONJ were assessed. Over the additional 1 year of treatment, only 5.5% (n = 4) of patients developed a new SRE. The overall Kaplan-Meier estimate for SRE incidence after 48 weeks on study was 6.75% (95 CI: 2.5-17.3). Although 51% of patients reported serious adverse events, only two cases were suspected as ZOL related. No patients had confirmed ONJ. The observed incidence of new renal impairment was 11% (none due to ZOL). Our study confirms the benefit over risk of continuing monthly ZOL for at least 2 years in patients with advanced cancer involving bone."

He was treated with a combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib. He remained in complete remission for 18 months and the treatment was well tolerated after dose reduction because of pyrexia. In March 2013, he developed bilateral pitting edema of the legs with an erythematous, slightly infiltrated rash on his back and upper arms. His face was edematous, with a heliotrope rash-like aspect. Eye examination showed bilateral blepharitis. Additional blood test showed inflammation and acute kidney injury Rifle category failure. A skin and kidney biopsy indicated a granulomatous inflammation. A complete workup for other causes of granulomatous inflammation was negative. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was stopped and corticosteroids were initiated, with a rapid beneficial effect on both the kidney function and skin rash. When corticosteroids were halted after 1 month, a rapid decline in the kidney function was observed. After reintroduction of corticosteroids, kidney function normalized and steroids could be tapered gradually over 6 months. To our knowledge, interstitial nephritis has not been described in patients on BRAF-targeted nor MEK-targeted therapy for melanoma, although it has been described in a melanoma patient treated with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, ipilimumab. Currently, the patient has no sign of local or distal recurrence of melanoma, notwithstanding that treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib has been stopped for 10 months and no other antimelanoma therapy was initiated."

However, some untoward adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity may limit its appropriate therapeutic use. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial ofthe infusion of fat emulsion (Intralipid) shortly after the infusion of ABD to evaluate its effects on reducing ABD-associated nephrotoxicity. Our patient population was made up of 31 patients who were randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 16) and a control group (15 patients). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in demographic or clinical variables. All patients received 1mg/kg/day of ABD in dextrose 5%. In addition, the patients in the intervention arm received Intralipid 10%, which was started as soon as possible within 1 hour after the infusion of ABD. ABD-associated nephrotoxicity was defined as a minimum 50% increase in baseline serum creatinine to a minimum of 2mg/dl. We also measured daily serum creatinine changes during the first 2 weeks of treatment, and we compared some other relevant indices of renal function, as well as ABD-related hypokalemia. We found no statistically significant differences between the two treatments in terms of ABD-associated nephrotoxicity or any of the other indices. We conclude that the administration of Intralipid 10% early after infusion of ABD in dextrose 5% does not have any effect in decreasing ABD-associated nephrotoxicity or hypokalemia."

      Normal saline (NS) is the most commonly used crystalloid solution worldwide but contains an excess of chloride and may cause metabolic acidosis and hyperchloraemia. Such abnormalities may be attenuated by the use of a balanced solution such as Plasma-Lyte 148 (PL-148).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess the feasibility, safety and biochemical and physiological effects of resuscitation with NS versus PL-148 in critically ill patients.
    


          Design, setting and participants:
        
      
      An exploratory, multicentre, doubleblind, randomised controlled trial involving patients aged &ge; 18 years who were prescribed crystalloid fluid resuscitation by the treating clinician between 16 July and 22 October 2015, in three multidisciplinary intensive care units in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Random allocation of NS or PL-148 was concealed, and all fluids were delivered in indistinguishable bags.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      NS or PL-148 was administered for all fluid resuscitation and for all subsequent crystalloid fluid therapy until Day 4 of ICU admission. The treating intensivist determined the rate and frequency of fluid administration.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Primary outcome was daily base excess (BE). Relevant secondary outcomes included the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), change in serum creatinine and serum chloride levels, and mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy patients were recruited, with 34 in the NS group and 33 in the PL-148 group available for analysis. Baseline characteristics of study patients were well balanced; the mean ages were 64 and 62 years, respectively, and nearly two-thirds of the patients in each group were men. The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III scores were 64 for the NS group (interquartile range [IQR], 48-73) and 55 for the PL-148 group (IQR, 44-81). After treatment, there was no significant difference in the worst (most negative) median BE between the NS and PL-148 groups (-4 mEq/L [IQR, -7 to -2 mEq/L] v -3 mEq/L [IQR, -7 to 2 mEq/L]; P = 0.42). Chloride levels were significantly higher with NS therapy (median, 111 mmol/L [IQR, 108-116 mmol/L] v 108 mmol/L [IQR, 106-110 mmol/L]; P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in the incidence of AKI (P = 0.48), peak creatinine levels (P = 0.92) or ICU or hospital mortality between the two groups.

          Methods:
        
      
      This was a multicenter cohort study recruiting patients from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Henan provinces between November 2008 and January 2010. Eighty HIV infected patients failing first-line regimens with serum creatinine lower than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal received TDF+ lamivudine (3TC)+ LPV/r were followed up for 120 weeks. CD4 cell count, viral load, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were monitored at each visit.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At baseline, 31.2% and 48.8% of patients had moderate/high-level resistance to TDF and 3TC, respectively; while 2.5% of patients had only low-level resistance to LPV/r. During 120 weeks of follow-up, virological suppression rate reached over 70% (<40 copies/ml) and 90% (<400 copies/ml), and median CD4 cell count increased from 157 cells/μL at baseline to 307 cells/μL at week 120. Baseline drug-resistance mutations had no impact on the efficacy of second-line antiretroviral therapy. Median eGFR dropped from 104.7 ml/min/1.73m2 at baseline to 95.6 ml/min/1.73m2 at week 24 and then recovered after week 96.

The Vigileo/FloTrac system could predict the patients' fluid responsiveness and tolerance to hydration. This prospective multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label study evaluated the efficacy of aggressive hydration guided by the Vigileo/FloTrac system for CIN prevention in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This trial enrolled patients with AMI undergoing urgent PCI, and these patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either aggressive hydration guided by Vigileo/FloTrac system (intervention group) or general hydration (control group). Patients with AMI in the intervention group received a loading dose of saline, and the hydration speed was adjusted according to the change of Vigileo/FloTrac index. The primary end point is CIN, which was defined as a >25% or >0.5 mg/100 ml increase in serum creatinine compared with baseline during the first 72 hours after urgent PCI. This trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04382313). A total of 344 patients with AMI were enrolled and randomized in our trial, and the baseline characteristics, including risk factors of CIN, of the Vigileo/FloTrac-guided hydration group (n = 173) and control group (n = 171) were well balanced (all p >0.05). The total hydration volume in Vigileo/FloTrac-guided hydration group was significantly much more than control group (1,910 ± 600 vs 440 ± 90 ml, p <0.001). The incidence of CIN in the Vigileo/FloTrac-guided hydration group was significantly decreased than that in the control group (12.1% [21/173] vs 22.2% [38/171], p = 0.013). There was not significantly different in the incidence of acute heart failure after PCI (9.2% [16/173] vs 7.6% [13/171], p = 0.583).

      Steady-state initial goal vancomycin trough concentration achievement.
    


          Measurements & results:
        
      
      More patients in the intervention arm (67 of 135 [50%]) achieved therapeutic trough vancomycin levels than in the control arm (74 of 264 [28%]; OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.65-3.90; P<0.001). Improved trough achievement was maintained even after adjustment for age, sex, APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) III score, fluid balance, baseline CLcr, surgical admission diagnosis, presence of sepsis, and goal trough concentration range (adjusted OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.76-4.44; P<0.001). Clinical outcomes were similar between groups.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Nonrandomized, incomplete algorithm compliance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A vancomycin dosing nomogram based on eGFRcr-cys significantly improved goal trough achievement compared to eCLcr among ICU patients with stable kidney function. Further studies are warranted to characterize the relationship between use of cystatin C-guided dosing and clinical outcomes."
Effect of Albumin Addition to Cardiopulmonary Bypass Prime on Outcomes in Children Undergoing Open-Heart Surgery (EACPO Study)-A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Abdul Rauf, Reena K Joshi, Neeraj Aggarwal, Mridul Agarwal, Manendra Kumar, Veronique Dinand, Raja Joshi, Abdul Raufet al.",2021 Jan,World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33078664/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      There is a paucity of literature regarding the association of high oncotic priming solutions for pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and outcomes, and no consensus exists regarding the composition of optimal CPB priming solution. This study aimed to examine the impact of high oncotic pressure priming by the addition of 20% human albumin on outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Double-blinded, randomized controlled study was done in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. Consecutive children with congenital heart diseases admitted for open-heart surgery were randomized into two groups, where the study group received an additional 20% albumin to conventional blood prime before CPB initiation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We enrolled 39 children in the high oncotic prime (added albumin) group and 37 children in the conventional prime group. In the first 24-hour postoperative period, children in the albumin group had significantly lower occurrence of hypotension (28.2% vs 54%, P = .02), requirement of fluid boluses (25.6% vs 54%, P = .006), and lactate clearance time (6 vs 9 hours, P < .001). Albumin group also had significantly higher platelet count (×103/µL) at 24 hours (112 vs 91, P = .02). There was no significant difference in intra-CPB hemodynamic parameters and incidence of acute kidney injury. In subgroup analysis based on risk category, significantly decreased intensive care unit stay (4 vs 5 days, P = .04) and hospital stay (5 vs 7 days, P = .002) were found in the albumin group in low-risk category.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      High oncotic pressure CPB prime using albumin addition might be beneficial over conventional blood prime, and our study does provide a rationale for further studies."
Estimated glomerular filtration rate and the risk-benefit profile of intensive blood pressure control amongst nondiabetic patients: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial.,"Y Obi, K Kalantar-Zadeh, A Shintani, C P Kovesdy, T Hamano, Y Obiet al.",2018 Mar,J Intern Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29044764/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01206062) reported reduced cardiovascular events by intensive blood pressure (BP) control amongst hypertensive patients without diabetes. However, the risk-benefit profile of intensive BP control may differ across estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a post hoc analysis of the SPRINT. Nondiabetic hypertensive adults (n = 9361) with eGFR >20 mL per min per 1.73 m2 were enrolled from 102 US facilities between November 2010 and March 2013 and were followed up until August 2015 (median follow-up, 3.26 years). Patients were randomly assigned to either a systolic BP target of <120 or <140 mmHg (for intensive or standard treatment, respectively). The outcomes of interests were the development of (i) fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and (ii) acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The cardiovascular benefit from intensive treatment was attenuated with lower eGFR (Pinteraction = 0.019), whereas eGFR did not modify the adverse effect on AKI (Pinteraction = 0.179). Amongst 891 participants with eGFR <45 mL per min per 1.73 m2 , intensive treatment did not reduce the cardiovascular outcome (54/446 vs. 54/445 events in the standard group, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62-1.38) with an absolute rate difference (ARD) of -0.02 (95% CI, -0.07 to +0.03) per 100 patient-years, whereas it increased AKI (62/446 vs. 38/445 events in the standard group; HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.12-2.66) with an ARD of +1.93 (95% CI, +1.88 to +1.97) per 100 patient-years.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intensive BP control may provide little or no benefit and even be harmful for patients with moderate-to-advanced chronic kidney disease."
Acute Kidney Injury With the RenalGuard System in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: The PROTECT-TAVI Trial (PROphylactic effecT of furosEmide-induCed diuresis with matched isotonic intravenous hydraTion in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation).,"Marco Barbanti, Simona Gulino, Piera Capranzano, Sebastiano Immè, Carmelo Sgroi, Claudia Tamburino, Yohei Ohno, Guilherme F Attizzani, Martina Patanè, Rita Sicuso, Gerlando Pilato, Alessio Di Landro, Denise Todaro, Emanuela Di Simone, Andrea Picci, Giuliana Giannetto, Giuliano Costa, Wanda Deste, Daniela Giannazzo, Carmelo Grasso, Davide Capodanno, Corrado Tamburino, Marco Barbantiet al.",2015 Oct,JACC Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26386766/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the RenalGuard System (PLC Medical Systems, Milford, Massachusetts) on prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
    


          Background:
        
      
      TAVR is associated with varying degrees of post-procedural AKI. The RenalGuard System is a dedicated device designed for contrast-induced AKI prevention. Whether this device is also effective in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR is unexplored.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The present is an investigator-driven, single-center, prospective, open-label, registry-based randomized study that used the TAVR institutional registry of the Ferrarotto Hospital in Catania, Italy, as the platform for randomization, data collection, and follow-up assessment. A total of 112 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR were randomly assigned to hydration with normal saline solution controlled by the RenalGuard system and furosemide (RenalGuard group) or normal saline solution (control group). The primary endpoint was the incidence of Valve Academic Research Consortium-defined AKI in the first 72 h after the procedure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The AKI rate was lower in the RenalGuard group than in the control group (n = 3 [5.4%] vs. n =14 [25.0%], respectively, p = 0.014). The majority of patients (5.4% vs. 23.2%) developed a mild AKI (stage 1); severe damage (stage 3) occurred only in 1 patient in the control group (0.0% vs. 1.8%). No case of in-hospital renal failure requiring dialysis was reported. No significant differences in terms of mortality, cerebrovascular events, bleeding, and hospitalization for heart failure were noted in both groups at 30 days.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Furosemide-induced diuresis with matched isotonic intravenous hydration using the RenalGuard system is an effective therapeutic tool to reduce the occurrence of AKI in patients undergoing TAVR."
"Acetaminophen as a Renoprotective Adjunctive Treatment in Patients With Severe and Moderately Severe Falciparum Malaria: A Randomized, Controlled, Open-Label Trial.","Katherine Plewes, Hugh W F Kingston, Aniruddha Ghose, Thanaporn Wattanakul, Md Mahtab Uddin Hassan, Md Shafiul Haider, Prodip K Dutta, Md Akhterul Islam, Shamsul Alam, Selim Md Jahangir, A S M Zahed, Md Abdus Sattar, M A Hassan Chowdhury, M Trent Herdman, Stije J Leopold, Haruhiko Ishioka, Kim A Piera, Prakaykaew Charunwatthana, Kamolrat Silamut, Tsin W Yeo, Sue J Lee, Mavuto Mukaka, Richard J Maude, Gareth D H Turner, Md Abul Faiz, Joel Tarning, John A Oates, Nicholas M Anstey, Nicholas J White, Nicholas P J Day, Md Amir Hossain, L Jackson Roberts Ii, Arjen M Dondorp, Katherine Pleweset al.",2018 Sep 14,Clin Infect Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29538635/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury independently predicts mortality in falciparum malaria. It is unknown whether acetaminophen's capacity to inhibit plasma hemoglobin-mediated oxidation is renoprotective in severe malaria.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This phase 2, open-label, randomized controlled trial conducted at two hospitals in Bangladesh assessed effects on renal function, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of acetaminophen. Febrile patients (>12 years) with severe falciparum malaria were randomly assigned to receive acetaminophen (1 g 6-hourly for 72 hours) or no acetaminophen, in addition to intravenous artesunate. Primary outcome was the proportional change in creatinine after 72 hours stratified by median plasma hemoglobin.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Between 2012 and 2014, 62 patients were randomly assigned to receive acetaminophen (n = 31) or no acetaminophen (n = 31). Median (interquartile range) reduction in creatinine after 72 hours was 23% (37% to 18%) in patients assigned to acetaminophen, versus 14% (29% to 0%) in patients assigned to no acetaminophen (P = .043). This difference in reduction was 37% (48% to 22%) versus 14% (30% to -71%) in patients with hemoglobin ≥45000 ng/mL (P = .010). The proportion with progressing kidney injury was higher among controls (subdistribution hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 8.5; P = .034). PK-PD analyses showed that higher exposure to acetaminophen increased the probability of creatinine improvement. No patient fulfilled Hy's law for hepatotoxicity.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this proof-of-principle study, acetaminophen showed renoprotection without evidence of safety concerns in patients with severe falciparum malaria, particularly in those with prominent intravascular hemolysis.

Effect of Canagliflozin on Urinary Albumin Excretion in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Microalbuminuria: A Pilot Study.,"Takeshi Osonoi, Maki Gouda, Mamiko Kubo, Kenji Arakawa, Toshio Hashimoto, Masanori Abe, Takeshi Osonoiet al.",2018 Oct,Diabetes Technol Ther,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30096243/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Albuminuria characterizes the progression of kidney injury. The effect of canagliflozin on the excretion of microalbumin was assessed for investigating its renoprotective potential in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Twenty Japanese patients with T2DM and microalbuminuria were enrolled and administered with 100 mg of canagliflozin once a day for 12 weeks. These subjects were admitted to the clinic at the start and end of the treatment period for 24-h urine collection. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in geometric mean 24-h urinary albumin excretion from baseline to week 12.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The urinary albumin level decreased by 42.0% (95% confidence interval: 21.9-57.0; P = 0.0011) after 12 weeks of canagliflozin treatment. A number of blood and urinary parameters also significantly decreased, including hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and creatinine clearance, while hematocrit was elevated. Among the biomarkers associated with kidney injury and inflammation, the urinary level of the oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine was also decreased. There were no meaningful correlations noted between changes in urinary albumin excretion and other parameters/biomarkers. No severe adverse events were reported over the 12-week treatment period.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results of this study indicate that canagliflozin decreases microalbuminuria in Japanese patients with T2DM. Albuminuria could be reduced as a result of changes in various physiological pathways; therefore, it is imperative that future, large-scale, studies attempt to determine the detailed mechanisms involved. Canagliflozin may offer a novel therapeutic option for Japanese patients with T2DM and incipient nephropathy."
Improving the safety of high-dose methotrexate for children with hematologic cancers in settings without access to MTX levels using extended hydration and additional leucovorin.,"Kalthi Vaishnavi, Deepak Bansal, Amita Trehan, Richa Jain, Savita Verma Attri, Kalthi Vaishnaviet al.",2018 Dec,Pediatr Blood Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768710/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      A lack of access to methotrexate levels is common in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), relevant for 80% of children with cancer worldwide. We evaluated whether high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) can be administered safely with extended hydration and leucovorin rescue, with monitoring of serum creatinine and urine pH.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The prospective study was conducted at a single centre in Chandigarh, India in 2015. Patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or with T-cell ALL or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL) were administered 3 and 5 gm/m2 of MTX (24 hr infusion), respectively. Six doses of leucovorin (15 mg/m2 /dose), instead of recommended three (for optimally reduced levels) at standard timing (42 hr from start of HD-MTX) were administered. Hydration (125 ml/m2 /hr) was continued for 72 hr, instead of the recommended 30 hr. Hydration fluid consisted of 0.45% sodium chloride, 5% dextrose, 7.5% sodium bicarbonate (50 mmol/l) and potassium chloride (20 mmol/l). Serum creatinine and urine pH were measured at baseline, 24 and 48 hr. The volume of hydration was increased (200 ml/m2 /hr) for a serum creatinine > 1.25 times the baseline.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study included 100 cycles of HD-MTX in 53 patients: B-ALL 25 patients (51 cycles), T-ALL 16 patients (28 cycles), T-NHL 10 patients (18 cycles), and relapsed ALL 2 patients (3 cycles). The mean age was 6.8 ± 3.2 years. Patients were underweight in 15 (15%) cycles. Patients in 23% of cycles had a rise in creatinine to >1.25 times the baseline. Toxicities (NCI CTCAE v4.0) included mucositis (32%), diarrhoea (10%), and febrile neutropenia (9%). One patient died from dengue shock syndrome.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It is safe to administer 3 or 5 gm/m2 of MTX (24 hr infusion) without measuring MTX levels, with extended hydration, additional doses of leucovorin, and monitoring of serum creatinine and urine pH."
Hydration with 15 mEq Magnesium Is Effective at Reducingthe Risk for Cisplatin-induced Nephrotoxicity in Patients Receiving Cisplatin (50 mg/m2) Combination Chemotherapy.,"Yoshihiro Yamamoto, Kazushi Watanabe, Ikuto Tsukiyama, Hiromitsu Yabushita, Katsuhiko Matsuura, Akihiko Wakatsuki, Yoshihiro Yamamotoet al.",2016 Apr,Anticancer Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27069173/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      We aimed to assess whether the efficacy of pre-hydration with 15 mEq magnesium prevents cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cisplatin regimens (dosage: 50 mg/m(2)or more) for gynecological cancer.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      This historical, prospective cohort study compared nephrotoxicity in patients who received pre-hydration with or without magnesium sulfate (Mg-hydration group, n=37; non-Mg-hydration group, n=37). We used serum creatinine (Scr), creatinine clearance (Ccr) and Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A change of Scr and Ccr in the Mg-hydration group was higher than in the non-Mg-hydration group. Based on the RIFLE criteria, the number of moderate renal dysfunction patients classified as ""Risk"" in the Mg-hydration group was significantly lower than in the non-Mg-hydration group (Mg-hydration group=21.6%; non-Mg-hydration group=51.4%; p<0.01). Serum magnesium levels in the Mg-hydration group significantly declined during chemotherapy (p<0.01).
    


          Conclusion:

      Although hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is commonly used as an intravascular volume expander in surgical patients, recent studies suggest that it may increase the risk of renal failure in critically ill patients. We hypothesized that patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and receiving HES would be more likely to develop markers of renal failure, such as increasing urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (u-NGAL), creatinine clearance (C(crea)), and decreasing urine output (UO).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 40 patients referred for radical prostatectomy received either 6% HES 130/0.4 or saline 0.9%; 7.5 mL/kg during the first hour of surgery and 5 mL/kg in the following hours; u-NGAL, urine albumin, C(crea), UO, arterial blood pressure, and plasma concentrations of creatinine, renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and vasopressin were measured before, during, and after surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-six patients completed the study. u-NGAL, C(crea), UO, plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, p-creatinine, urine albumin, and arterial blood pressure were the same in both groups. Blood loss was higher in the HES group (HES 1250 vs saline 750 mL), while p-albumin was reduced to a significantly lower level. P-renin and p-angiotensin-II increased in both groups, whereas p-aldosterone and p-vasopressin increased significantly in the saline group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We found no evidence of nephrotoxicity after infusion of 6% HES 130/0.4 in patients undergoing prostatectomy with normal preoperative renal function. Hemodynamic stability and infused fluid volume were the same in both groups. We observed an increased blood loss in the group given 6% HES 130/0.4."

In adults, a colistin loading dose is recommended to achieve therapeutic concentrations within 12-24 h. Here we aimed to describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of a loading dose versus a recommended initial dose of intravenous colistimethate sodium (CMS) in paediatric patients. A prospective, open-label, PK study was conducted in paediatric patients (age 2-18 years) with normal renal function. Patients (n = 20) were randomly assigned to receive either a CMS loading dose (LD group) of 4 mg of colistin base activity (CBA)/kg/dose or a standard initial dose (NLD group) of 2.5 mg (12-h interval) or 1.7 mg (8-h interval) of CBA/kg/dose. Serial blood samples were collected. Plasma concentrations of formed colistin were measured by LC-MS/MS. PK parameters were reported. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was monitored by serum creatinine and urine NGAL. The median (interquartile range) age and body weight were 8.5 (3.5-11.3) years and 21.5 (13.5-20.0) kg. The mean (standard deviation) of first-dose PK parameters of the LD group versus the NLD group were: Cmax, 6.1 (2.4) vs. 4.1 (1.3) mg/L; AUC0-t, 26.5 (12.5) vs. 13.5 (3.6) mg/L·h; Vd, 0.7 (0.4) vs. 0.6 (0.3) L/kg; and t1/2, 2.9 (0.6) vs. 2.6 (0.4) h. No patient developed AKI by serum creatinine criteria. A CMS loading dose is beneficial for improvement of colistin exposure without increased AKI. A higher daily dose of CMS should be considered, especially for MDR-GNB treatment."
Prevention of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy by Central Venous Pressure-Guided Fluid Administration in Chronic Kidney Disease and Congestive Heart Failure Patients.,"Geng Qian, Zhenhong Fu, Jun Guo, Feng Cao, Yundai Chen, Geng Qianet al.",2016 Jan 11,JACC Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26685074/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      This study aimed to explore the hemodynamic index-guided hydration method for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) to reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and at the same time to avoid the acute heart failure.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Patients at moderate or high risk for CIN should receive sufficient hydration before contrast application.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative clinical trial enrolled 264 consecutive patients with CKD and CHF undergoing coronary procedures. These patients were randomly assigned to either central venous pressure (CVP)-guided hydration group (n = 132) or the standard hydration group (n = 132). In the CVP-guided group, the hydration infusion rate was dynamically adjusted according to CVP level every hour. CIN was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine (SCr) >0.5 mg/dl (44.2 μmol/l) or a relative increase >25% compared with baseline SCr.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline characteristics were well-matched between the 2 groups. The total mean volume of isotonic saline administered in the CVP-guided hydration group was significantly higher than the control group (1,827 ± 497 ml vs. 1,202 ± 247 ml; p < 0.001). CIN occurred less frequently in CVP-guided hydration group than the control group (15.9% vs. 29.5%; p = 0.006). The incidences of acute heart failure during the hydration did not differ between the 2 groups (3.8% vs. 3.0%; p = 0.500).

      CVP-guided fluid administration can safely and effectively reduce the risk of CIN in patients with CKD and CHF. (Central Venous Pressure Guided Hydration Prevention for Contrast-Induced Nephropathy; NCT02405377)."
Plasma KIM-1 Is Associated with Recurrence Risk after Nephrectomy for Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Trial of the ECOG-ACRIN Research Group (E2805).,"Wenxin Xu, Mäneka Puligandla, Brian Halbert, Naomi B Haas, Keith T Flaherty, Robert G Uzzo, Janice P Dutcher, Robert S DiPaola, Venkata Sabbisetti, Rupal S Bhatt, Wenxin Xuet al.",2021 Jun 15,Clin Cancer Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33832947/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      No circulating biomarkers are currently available to identify patients at highest risk of recurrence after nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) is overexpressed in RCC and its ectodomain circulates in plasma. We investigated whether plasma KIM-1 is a prognostic biomarker in patients with localized RCC after nephrectomy.
    


          Experimental design:
        
      
      The ECOG-ACRIN E2805 (ASSURE) trial evaluated adjuvant sunitinib, sorafenib, or placebo in resected high-risk RCC. KIM-1 levels were measured from banked plasma at trial enrollment 4-12 weeks after nephrectomy. Lognormal accelerated failure time models were used to test for association between KIM-1 and disease-free survival (DFS) as well as overall survival (OS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Plasma from 418 patients was analyzed. Higher post-nephrectomy KIM-1 was associated with worse DFS across all study arms after adjustment for Fuhrman grade, T stage, N stage, and tumor histology [survival time ratio 0.56 for 75th vs. 25th percentile of KIM-1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.42-0.73; P < 0.001]. The association between KIM-1 and DFS was stronger among patients with pathologic nodal involvement (P interaction = 0.0086). The addition of post-nephrectomy KIM-1 improved the concordance of clinical prognostic models [Stage, Size, Grade, and Necrosis (SSIGN) concordance 0.57 vs. 0.43, P = 0.05; UCLA International Staging System (UISS) concordance 0.60 vs. 0.40, P = 0.0005]. Higher post-nephrectomy KIM-1 was also associated with worse OS after multivariable adjustment (survival time ratio 0.71 for 75th vs. 25th percentile of KIM-1; 95% CI, 0.56-0.91; P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Post-nephrectomy plasma KIM-1 is associated with DFS and OS in RCC, and may be a biomarker for microscopic residual disease."

      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of perioperative low cardiac output syndrome due to postoperative myocardial dysfunction. Myocardial dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is a potential indication for the use of levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer with 3 beneficial cardiovascular effects (inotropic, vasodilatory, and anti-inflammatory), which appears effective in improving clinically relevant outcomes.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter randomized trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Tertiary care hospitals.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Cardiac surgery patients (n = 1,000) with postoperative myocardial dysfunction (defined as patients with intraaortic balloon pump and/or high-dose standard inotropic support) will be randomized to receive a continuous infusion of either levosimendan (0.05-0.2 μg/[kg min]) or placebo for 24-48 hours.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      The primary end point will be 30-day mortality. Secondary end points will be mortality at 1 year, time on mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, decision to stop the study drug due to adverse events or to start open-label levosimendan, and length of intensive care unit and hospital stay. We will test the hypothesis that levosimendan reduces 30-day mortality in cardiac surgery patients with postoperative myocardial dysfunction.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This trial is planned to determine whether levosimendan could improve survival in patients with postoperative low cardiac output syndrome. The results of this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial may provide important insights into the management of low cardiac output in cardiac surgery."

      S-1 plus cisplatin is a standard regimen for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) in Asia. The ToGA trial established a fluoropyrimidine plus cisplatin and trastuzumab as a standard treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive AGC. In the HERBIS-1 trial, trastuzumab combined with S-1 plus cisplatin showed promising antitumor activity in patients with HER2-positive AGC. However, cisplatin has several important drawbacks, including vomiting and renal toxicity. These disadvantages of cisplatin are prominent in elderly patients. Therefore, we conducted a prospective phase II study of trastuzumab plus S-1 without cisplatin in elderly patients with HER2-positive AGC.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients 65 years or older who had HER2-positive AGC received S-1 orally on days 1-28 of a 42-day cycle and trastuzumab intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 51 patients were enrolled. Two patients were ineligible. The full analysis set thus comprised 49 patients. The median age was 71 years (range 65-85). The confirmed response rate was 40.8% (95% CI 27.1-54.6%), and the null hypothesis was rejected. The median follow-up period was 10.6 months. Median overall survival was 15.8 months. Median progression-free survival was 5.1 months, and time to treatment failure was 4.0 months. Major grade 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia (12.0%), anemia (24.0%), diarrhea (10.0%), and anorexia (12.0%). There was one treatment-related death.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Trastuzumab in combination with S-1 alone demonstrated promising antitumor activity and manageable toxic effects as well as promising survival results in elderly patients with HER2-positive AGC.

The incidence of CE in the Mg+ was significantly lower than in the Mg- (9.8% vs. 22.7%; P=0.025). Multivariate analysis revealed that Mg supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of CE (odds ratio, 0.36; confidence interval, 0.13-0.99).

      Although acute cellular rejection after heart transplantation (HTX) can be controlled by full-dose calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based immunosuppressive regimens, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), nephrotoxicity, and malignancy remain ongoing problems. To evaluate the potential beneficial effects of sirolimus and CNI reduction, we compared de novo low-dose tacrolimus and sirolimus with standard tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)-based immunosuppression after HTX.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We analyzed a long-term follow-up cohort of 126 patients who underwent HTX during the period 1998-2005 and received either de novo low-dose tacrolimus/sirolimus (lowTAC/SIR; n = 61) or full-dose tacrolimus/MMF (TAC/MMF; n = 64).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Freedom from treatment switch was less in the low TAC/SIR group than in the TAC/MMF group (51.7% vs 73.0%, p = 0.038) 8 years after HTX. Freedom from acute rejection was 90.6% in the low TAC/SIR group vs 80.3% in the TAC/MMF group (p = 0.100). There was no difference in freedom from International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation CAV grade ≥ 1 (55.4% vs 60.0%, p = 0.922), time until CAV diagnosis (4.2 ± 2.0 years vs 3.2 ± 2.4 years, p = 0.087), and CAV severity (p = 0.618). The benefit of reduced early maximum creatinine for low TAC/SIR treatment (1.8 ± 0.9 mg/dl vs 2.4 ± 1.1 mg/dl in TAC/MMF group, p < 0.001) did not continue 5 years and 8 years after HTX (1.4 ± 0.4 mg/dl vs 1.7 ± 1.2 mg/dl, p = 0.333, and 1.6 ± 1.1 mg/dl vs 1.6 ± 0.8 mg/dl, p = 0.957). The trend for superior survival at 5 years with low TAC/SIR treatment (93.1% vs 81.3% in TAC/MMF group, p = 0.051) could not be confirmed after 8 years (84.7% vs 75.0%, p = 0.138). Multivariate analysis at 8 years did not reveal any benefit of low TAC/SIR treatment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Reduction of de novo CNI did not result in superior long-term renal function. Low-dose mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibition did not achieve any benefit in CAV prevention compared with full-dose TAC/MMF after HTX."

      Thrombocytopenia is a life-threatening complication in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In this study (ASPIRE), we aimed to assess eltrombopag, an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, for thrombocytopenia (grade 4) treatment in adult patients with advanced MDS or AML.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      ASPIRE consisted of an open-label, double-blind phase for 8 weeks and a randomised, double-blind phase (parts 1 and 2, reported here) for 12 weeks, and an open-label extension (part 3). Eligible patients were men and women aged 18 years or older, with intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS or AML, with bone marrow blasts of 50% or less, and had either grade 4 thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow insufficiency (platelet counts <25 × 109 per L) or grade 4 thrombocytopenia before platelet transfusion, with 25 × 109 platelets per L or greater after transfusion. Additionally, eligible patients had at least one of the following within the screening period of 4 weeks: platelet transfusion, symptomatic bleeding, or platelet count of less than 10 × 109 per L. During part 1, patients received eltrombopag, and dose-escalation criteria for part 2 were determined. In part 2, we randomly allocated patients 2:1 using an interactive voice-response system to eltrombopag or placebo, stratified by baseline platelet count (<10 × 109 platelets per L vs ≥10 × 109 platelets per L) and disease (MDS vs AML). In parts 1 and 2, patients received supportive standard of care and initiated eltrombopag or placebo at 100 mg per day (50 mg per day for patients of east-Asian heritage) to a maximum of 300 mg per day (150 mg per day for patients of east-Asian heritage). The part 2 primary objective was assessed by a composite primary endpoint of clinically relevant thrombocytopenic events (CRTE) during weeks 5-12, defined as one of the following events, either alone or in combination: grade 3 or worse haemorrhagic adverse events; platelet counts of less than 10 × 109 per L; or platelet transfusions. Efficacy analyses were based on intention to treat; clinically meaningful efficacy was defined as 30% absolute difference between groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01440374.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      In part 1, 17 patients received eltrombopag and 11 patients completed treatment; four experienced significantly increased platelet counts, and ten had reduced platelet transfusion requirements. In part 2 we randomly allocated 145 patients to receive supportive care plus eltrombopag (n=98) or placebo (n=47); similar proportions had MDS (50 [51%] patients to eltrombopag, 22 (47%) patients to placebo) or AML (48 [49%] patients to eltrombopag, 25 [53%] patients to placebo). Average weekly CRTE proportions from weeks 5-12 were significantly lower with eltrombopag (54% [95% CI 43-64]) than with placebo (69% [57-80], odds ratio [OR] 0·20, 95% CI 0·05-0·87; p=0·032) although the difference between treatment groups was less than 30%. The most common grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events were fatigue (six [6%] in the eltrombopag group and one [2%] in the placebo group), hypokalaemia (six [6%] and two [4%]), pneumonia (five [5%] and five [11%]), and febrile neutropenia (five [5%] and six [13%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 56 (58%) eltrombopag-treated patients and 32 (68%) placebo-treated patients. Seven eltrombopag recipients and two placebo recipients had serious adverse events that were suspected to be study drug-related (eltrombopag: acute kidney injury, arterial thrombosis, bone pain, diarrhoea, myocardial infarction, pyrexia, retinal vein occlusion, n=1 each; placebo: vomiting, white blood cell count increased, n=1 each). Two eltrombopag recipients (arterial thrombosis n=1; myocardial infarction n=1) and no placebo recipients experienced fatal serious adverse events suspected to be study drug-related.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      No new safety concerns were noted with eltrombopag and the trial met the primary objective of a reduction in CRTEs; eltrombopag might be a treatment option for thrombocytopenic patients with AML or MDS who are ineligible for other treatment and who are not receiving disease-modifying treatment.

      The aim of the INSTINCT trial was to assess the effect of intravenous polyspecific immunoglobulin G (IVIG) compared with placebo on self-reported physical function in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with necrotising soft tissue infection (NSTI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We randomised 100 patients with NSTI 1:1 to masked infusion of 25 g of IVIG (Privigen, CSL Behring) or an equal volume of 0.9% saline once daily for the first 3 days of ICU admission. The primary outcome was the physical component summary (PCS) score of the 36-item short form health survey (SF-36) 6 months after randomisation; patients who had died were given the lowest possible score (zero).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 100 patients randomised, 87 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis of the PCS score, 42 patients (84%) in the IVIG group and 45 patients (90%) in the placebo group. The two intervention groups had similar baseline characteristics with the exception of IVIG use before randomisation (1 dose was allowed) and rates of acute kidney injury. Median PCS scores were 36 (interquartile range 0-43) in the group assigned to IVIG and 31 (0-47) in the group assigned to placebo (mean adjusted difference 1 (95% confidence interval -7 to 10), p = 0.81). The result was supported by analyses adjusted for baseline prognostics, those in the per protocol populations, in the subgroups (site of NSTI) and those done post hoc adjusted for IVIG use before randomisation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In ICU patients with NSTI, we observed no apparent effects of adjuvant IVIG on self-reported physical functioning at 6 months.

      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a risk factor for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). We investigated whether pretreatment with statin, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) reduces the risk of CIN.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a prospective trial and enrolled a total of 334 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Patients were divided into four groups: Group I (statin 40mg), Group II (statin 80mg), Group III (statin 80mg plus NAC 1200mg) and Group IV (regimen of group III plus NaHCO3 154mEq/L). CIN was defined as ≥25% or ≥0.5mg/dL increase in serum creatinine from the baseline within the 72h after PCI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CIN occurred in 72 (21.6%) patients. The incidence of CIN was the lowest in the group III (14.3%), and multivariate analysis showed the lower incidence of CIN in group III compared to Group I [odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.64, p=0.002]. Admission hyperglycemia [(AHG)>198mg/dL] (OR 2.20, 95% Cl 1.20-3.68, p=0.011) and the use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) (OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.38-12.78, p=0.016) were independent predictors for CIN. The CIN (OR 9.00, 95% CI 1.30-62.06, p=0.026) was an independent predictor for in-hospital mortality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Combination of high-dose statin plus NAC was associated with lower incidence of CIN in patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI compared to statin only."

Low vs. high haemoglobin trigger for transfusion in vascular surgery: protocol for a randomised trial.,"A Møller, H B Nielsen, J Wetterslev, O B Pedersen, D Hellemann, S Shahidi, A Mølleret al.",2017 Sep,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28782109/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      In patients with cardiovascular disease, guidelines for administration of red blood cells (RBC) are mainly based on studies outside the vascular surgical setting with the recommendation to use a haemoglobin (hb) trigger-level lower than by guidelines from The European Society for Vascular Surgery. Restricting RBC transfusion may affect blood O2 transport with a risk for development of tissue ischaemia and postoperative complications.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a single-centre, open-label, assessor blinded trial, 58 vascular surgical patients (> 40 years of age) awaiting open surgery of the infrarenal aorta or infrainguinal arterial bypass surgery undergo a web-based randomisation to one of two groups: perioperative RBC transfusion triggered by hb < 8 g/dl or hb < 9.7 g/dl. Administration of fluid follows an individualised strategy by optimising cardiac stroke volume and near-infrared spectroscopy determines tissue oxygenation. Serious adverse event rates are: myocardial injury (troponin-I ≥ 45 ng/l or ischaemic electrocardiographic findings at day 30), acute kidney injury, death, stroke and severe transfusion reactions. A follow-up visit takes place 30 days after surgery and a follow-up of serious adverse events in the Danish National Patient Register within 90 days is pending.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This trial is expected to determine whether a RBC transfusion triggered by hb < 9.7 g/dl compared with hb < 8 g/dl results in adequate separation of postoperative hb levels, transfusion of more RBC units and maintains a higher tissue oxygenation. The results will inform the design of a multicentre trial for evaluation of important postoperative outcomes."

Prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy by adequate hydration combined with isosorbide dinitrate for patients with renal insufficiency and congestive heart failure.,"Geng Qian, Chang-Fu Liu, Jun Guo, Wei Dong, Jin Wang, Yundai Chen, Geng Qianet al.",2019 Jan,Clin Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30054906/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Adequate hydration remains the mainstay of contrast-induced nephropathy prevention, and nitrates could reduce cardiac preload.
    


          Hypothesis:
        
      
      This study aimed to explore the adequate hydration with nitrates for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) to reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and at the same time avoid the acute heart failure.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Three hundred and ninty-four consecutive patients with CKD and CHF undergoing coronary procedures were randomized to either adequate hydration with nitrates (n = 196) or to routine hydration (control group; n = 198). The adequate hydration group received continuous intravenous infusion of isosorbide dinitrate combined with intravenous infusion of isotonic saline at a rate of 1.5 mL/kg/h during perioperative period. The definition of CIN was a 25% or 0.5 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine over baseline. This trial is registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02718521.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline characteristics were well-matched between the two groups. CIN occurred less frequently in adequate hydration group than the control group (12.8% vs 21.2%; P = 0.018). The incidence of acute heart failure did not differ between the two groups (8 [4.08%] vs 6[3.03%]; P = 0.599). Cumulative major adverse events (death, myocardial infarction, stoke, hospitalization for acute heart failure) during the 90-day follow-up were lower in the adequate hydration with nitrates group (P = 0.002).

      Adequate hydration with nitrates can safely and effectively reduce the risk of CIN in patients with CKD and CHF."
Brincidofovir for Asymptomatic Adenovirus Viremia in Pediatric and Adult Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Phase II Trial.,"Michael S Grimley, Roy F Chemaly, Janet A Englund, Joanne Kurtzberg, Gregory Chittick, Thomas M Brundage, Andrew Bae, Marion E Morrison, Vinod K Prasad, Michael S Grimleyet al.",2017 Mar,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28063938/,"Adenoviruses, Antiviral, BCV, Brincidofovir, CMX001, Stem cell transplantation, Treatment.","Adenovirus infection in immunocompromised patients contributes to significant morbidity and mortality, especially after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Brincidofovir (BCV, CMX001) is an orally bioavailable lipid conjugate of cidofovir that has in vitro activity against adenoviruses and other double-stranded DNA viruses. This randomized placebo-controlled phase II trial evaluated pre-emptive treatment with BCV for the prevention of adenovirus disease in pediatric and adult allogeneic HCT recipients with asymptomatic adenovirus viremia. Allogeneic HCT recipients with adenovirus viremia were randomized 1:1:1 to receive oral BCV 100 mg (2 mg/kg if <50 kg) twice weekly (BIW), BCV 200 mg (4 mg/kg if <50 kg) once weekly (QW), or placebo for 6 to 12 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. For randomization, subjects were stratified by screening absolute lymphocyte count (<300 cells/mm3 versus ≥300 cells/mm3). Assignment to BCV or placebo was double blinded; dose frequency was unblinded. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects experiencing treatment failure, defined as either progression to probable or definitive adenovirus disease or confirmed increasing adenovirus viremia (≥1 log10 copies/mL) during randomized therapy. Between June 2011 and December 2012, 48 subjects were randomized to the BCV BIW (n = 14), BCV QW (n = 16), or placebo (n = 18) groups. The proportion of subjects with treatment failure in the BCV BIW group was 21% (odds ratio, .53; 95% confidence interval [CI], .11 to 2.71; P = .45), 38% (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, .30 to 5.05, P = .779) in the BCV QW group, and 33% in the placebo group. All-cause mortality was lower in the BCV BIW (14%) and BCV QW groups (31%) relative to the placebo group (39%), but these differences were not statistically significant. After 1 week of therapy, 8 of 12 subjects (67%) randomized to BCV BIW had undetectable adenovirus viremia (<100 copies/mL), compared with 4 of 14 subjects (29%) randomized to BCV QW and 5 of 15 subjects (33%) randomized to placebo. In a post hoc analysis of subjects with viremia ≥1000 copies/mL at baseline, 6 of 7 BCV BIW subjects (86%) achieved undetectable viremia compared with 2 of 8 placebo subjects (25%; P = .04). Early treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was more common in subjects treated with BCV than with placebo. Diarrhea was the most common event in all groups (57% BCV BIW, 38% BCV QW, 28% placebo), but it led to treatment discontinuation in only 1 subject receiving BCV QW. Events diagnosed as acute graft-versus-host disease, primarily of the gastrointestinal tract, were more frequent in the BCV BIW group (50%) than in the BCV QW (25%) and placebo (17%) groups. There was no evidence of myelotoxicity or nephrotoxicity in BCV-treated subjects. The results of this trial confirm the antiviral activity of BCV against adenoviruses. Further investigation is ongoing to define the optimal treatment strategy for HCT recipients with serious adenovirus infection and disease."
Nonaggressive Versus Aggressive Intravenous Fluid Therapy in Acute Pancreatitis With More Than 24 Hours From Disease Onset: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Jesús Eduardo Cuéllar-Monterrubio, Roberto Monreal-Robles, Emmanuel I González-Moreno, Omar D Borjas-Almaguer, José Luis Herrera-Elizondo, Diego García-Compean, Héctor J Maldonado-Garza, José Alberto González-González, Jesús Eduardo Cuéllar-Monterrubioet al.",2020 Apr,Pancreas,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32282773/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to compare a ""nonaggressive"" hydration versus an ""aggressive"" hydration using Hartmann's solution in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) with more than 24 hours from disease onset.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We included 88 patients with AP with more than 24 hours from disease onset, and were randomized into 2 groups. Group I (n = 45) received a nonaggressive hydration (Hartmann's solution at 1.5 mL kg h for the first 24 hours and 30 mL kg during the next 24 hours), and group II (n = 43) received an aggressive hydration (bolus of Hartmann's solution 20 mL kg, followed by an infusion of 3 mL kg h for the first 24 hours and then 30 mL kg for the next 24 hours).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean volume of fluid administered was greater in group II (P < 0.001). We did not find differences when comparing both groups in reference to persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P = 0.528), pancreatic necrosis (P = 0.710), respiratory complications (P = 0.999), acute kidney injury (P = 0.714), or length of hospital stay (P = 0.892).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study suggests that the clinical evolution of patients with AP with more than 24 hours from disease onset is similar using an aggressive or nonaggressive hydration."

          Methods:
        
      
      Patients requiring pre-dilution CVVH at 4 l/h were randomly assigned to group A (RCA only), group B (normal-dose dalteparin anticoagulation only) or group C (RCA plus low-dose dalteparin). The primary endpoint was filter runtime and the secondary endpoints were premature clotting of the filter and anticoagulation-related side effects.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-three patients completed the study. The mean filter runtime was significantly longer in group C (40.4 ± 30.9 h) than those in group A (21.2 ± 13.5 h, p = 0.006) and group B (25.1 ± 24.0 h, p = 0.040). The rate of premature clotting, new onset of bleeding, hypocalcemia and metabolic acidosis did not differ significantly in three groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RCA plus low-dose dalteparin prolonged filter runtime compared with RCA only or normal-dose dalteparin only without increasing the incidence of anticoagulation-related complications."
The impact of N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid in contrast-induced nephropathy in critical care patients: an open-label randomized controlled study.,"Eleni Palli, Demosthenes Makris, John Papanikolaou, Grigorios Garoufalis, Irini Tsilioni, Paris Zygoulis, Epaminondas Zakynthinos, Eleni Palliet al.",2017 Oct 31,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29089038/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The aim was to investigate whether the use of N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid reduce contrast-induced nephropathy incidence in critical care patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a one-center, two-arm, prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled trial in the Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. Patients with stable renal function, who underwent non urgent contrast-enhanced computed tomography for diagnostic purposes, were included in the study. Patients in the treatment group (NacA, n = 60) received intravenously N-acetylcysteine (1200 mg) and ascorbic acid (2 g) dissolved separately in 100 ml of normal saline 2 hours before, and at 10 hours and 18 hours following the infusion of contrast agent, while control group patients (CG, n = 64) received only normal saline. All patients received additional hydration. Contrast-induced nephropathy was defined as relative increase by 25% of the baseline values of serum creatinine.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Contrast-induced nephropathy in NacA and CG were 18.33% and 15.6%, respectively (p = 0.81). The percentage change median (interquartile range (IR)) of serum cystatin-C (mg/L) from baseline in patients who underwent contrast-induced tomography, were 37.23% (28.53) and 93.20% (46.90) in NacA and in CG, respectively (p = 0.03). The 8-isoprostane serum levels in NacA were significantly lower compared to CG at 2 hours (p = 0.012) and 24 hours (p = 0.006) following radiocontrast infusion. Multivariate analysis revealed that contrast-induced nephropathy was independently associated with a higher baseline ratio of serum urea/creatinine (odds ratio, 1.02; 95 CI%, 1.00-1.05) and with the use of nephrotoxic medications (odds ratio, 0.24; 95 CI%, 0.06-0.94).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Intravenous administration of N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid failed to reduce contrast-induced nephropathy in critically ill patients who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography, despite a significant reduction of 8-isoprostane levels in treated patients.

          Methods:
        
      
      Initial dose escalation of NAMI-A was performed in a 28 day cycle: NAMI-A as a 3 h infusion through a port-a-cath at a starting dose of 300 mg/m(2) at day 1, 8 and 15, in combination with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) at days 2, 9 and 16. Subsequently, dose escalation of NAMI-A in a 21 day schedule was explored. At the maximal tolerable dose level of this schedule an expansion group was enrolled of which 15 patients were evaluable for response.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Due to frequent neutropenic dose interruptions in the third week, the 28 day schedule was amended into a 21 day schedule. The maximal tolerable dose was 300 and 450 mg/m(2) of NAMI-A (21 day schedule). Main adverse events consisted of neutropenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, transient creatinine elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, and renal toxicity.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      NAMI-A administered in combination with gemcitabine is only moderately tolerated and less active in NSCLC patients after first line treatment than gemcitabine alone."
Application of the Hartford Hospital Nomogram for Plazomicin Dosing Interval Selection in Patients with Complicated Urinary Tract Infection.,"Tomefa E Asempa, Joseph L Kuti, Julie D Seroogy, Allison S Komirenko, David P Nicolau, Tomefa E Asempaet al.",2019 Sep 23,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31358580/,"aminoglycoside, dosing, nephrotoxicity, pharmacokinetics.","Plazomicin is a new FDA-approved aminoglycoside antibiotic for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). In the product labeling, trough-based therapeutic drug management (TDM) is recommended for cUTI patients with renal impairment to prevent elevated trough concentrations associated with serum creatinine increases of ≥0.5 mg/dl above baseline. Herein, the utility of the Hartford nomogram to prevent plazomicin trough concentrations exceeding the TDM trough of 3 μg/ml and optimize the area under the curve (AUC) was assessed. The AUC reference range was defined as the 5th to 95th percentile AUC observed in the phase 3 cUTI trial (EPIC) (121 to 368 μg · h/ml). Observed 10-h plazomicin concentrations from patients in EPIC (n = 281) were plotted on the nomogram to determine an eligible dosing interval (every 24 h [q24h], q36h, q48h). Based on creatinine clearance (CLcr), a 15- or 10-mg/kg of body weight dose was simulated with the nomogram-derived interval. The nomogram recommended an extended interval (q36h and q48h) in 31% of patients. Compared with the 15 mg/kg q24h regimen received by patients with CLcr of ≥60 ml/min in EPIC, the nomogram-derived interval reduced the proportion of patients with troughs of ≥3 μg/ml (q36h, 27% versus 0%, P = 0.021; q48h, 57% versus 0%, P = 0.002) while significantly increasing the number of patients within the AUC range. Compared with the 8 to 12 mg/kg q24h regimen (received by patients with CLcr of >30 to 59 ml/min in EPIC), the nomogram-derived interval significantly reduced the proportion of troughs of ≥3μg/ml in the q48h cohort (72% versus 0%, P < 0.001) while maintaining a similar proportion of patients in the AUC range. Simulated application of the Hartford nomogram optimized plazomicin exposures in patients with cUTI while reducing troughs to <3 μg/ml."

      We assessed the effects of a protocol restricting resuscitation fluid vs. a standard care protocol after initial resuscitation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We randomised 151 adult patients with septic shock who had received initial fluid resuscitation in nine Scandinavian ICUs. In the fluid restriction group fluid boluses were permitted only if signs of severe hypoperfusion occurred, while in the standard care group fluid boluses were permitted as long as circulation continued to improve.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The co-primary outcome measures, resuscitation fluid volumes at day 5 and during ICU stay, were lower in the fluid restriction group than in the standard care group [mean differences -1.2 L (95 % confidence interval -2.0 to -0.4); p < 0.001 and -1.4 L (-2.4 to -0.4) respectively; p < 0.001]. Neither total fluid inputs and balances nor serious adverse reactions differed statistically significantly between the groups. Major protocol violations occurred in 27/75 patients in the fluid restriction group. Ischaemic events occurred in 3/75 in the fluid restriction group vs. 9/76 in the standard care group (odds ratio 0.32; 0.08-1.27; p = 0.11), worsening of acute kidney injury in 27/73 vs. 39/72 (0.46; 0.23-0.92; p = 0.03), and death by 90 days in 25/75 vs. 31/76 (0.71; 0.36-1.40; p = 0.32).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A protocol restricting resuscitation fluid successfully reduced volumes of resuscitation fluid compared with a standard care protocol in adult ICU patients with septic shock. The patient-centred outcomes all pointed towards benefit with fluid restriction, but our trial was not powered to show differences in these exploratory outcomes.

      To assess safety and efficacy of a switch to unboosted atazanavir (ATV) among HIV-infected adults receiving ATV/ritonavir (r) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      HIV-infected adults with viral load (VL) <40 copies/mL at screening and <150 copies/mL consistently for ≥3 months while receiving a regimen including ATV/r and TDF were randomized to continue ATV/r 300/100 mg daily (control) or change to ATV 400 mg daily (switch), while maintaining their TDF backbone. The primary outcome was proportion of subjects without treatment failure (regimen switch or VL > 200 copies/mL twice consecutively) at 48 weeks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty participants (46 male, median age 47 years) were randomized, 25 to each arm. At week 48, treatment success occurred in 76% in the control arm and 92% in the switch arm (ITT, p = 0.25). ATV trough levels at week 9 were higher in controls (median 438 ng/mL) than in the switch arm (median 124 ng/mL) (p = 0.003), as was total bilirubin at week 48 (median 38 μmol/L and 28 μmol/L, respectively; p = 0.02). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased in the control arm (p = 0.007), but did not change in the switch arm. At week 48, eGFR was higher in the switch arm (median 96 mL/min) than in the control arm (median 85 mL/min) (p = 0.035), but the arms were similar with respect to fasting glucose, C-reactive protein, and lipid parameters.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Switching from ATV/r to unboosted ATV appears to be safe and effective in selected virologically suppressed patients receiving TDF-containing regimens, and may have favorable effects on bilirubin and renal function."
Does sodium bicarbonate infusion really have no effect on the incidence of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery? A prospective observational trial.,"Anna J Wetz, Anselm Bräuer, Michael Quintel, Daniel Heise, Anna J Wetzet al.",2015 Apr 22,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25899029/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequently observed phenomenon after cardiac surgery with cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB); this severe complication is associated with adverse patient outcomes. There are multiple mechanisms involved in AKI during cardiac surgery, including CPB-dependent hemolysis. An IV infusion of sodium bicarbonate, which leads to urine alkalization, may play a role in preventing AKI. Recently, several trials have investigated the effect of sodium bicarbonate and reported controversial results. The purpose of this investigation was to investigate the following question. Under what circumstances can sodium bicarbonate prevent postoperative AKI?
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We analyzed data from 342 patients undergoing CPB surgery at the University Hospital Goettingen, Germany. A total of 174 patients received a preemptive dose of sodium bicarbonate. Directly after the induction of anesthesia, the continuous infusion of 0.15 mmol/kg body weight/h was started and continued until 2 pm on the first postoperative day. Patients who were not treated with sodium bicarbonate formed the control group (n = 168). To verify the AKI risk configuration of each group, we surveyed risk factors and determined the commonly used clinical predictive score according to Thakar and colleagues. We recorded the concentration of free hemoglobin (fhb) to estimate the amount of CPB-dependent hemolysis. The definition of AKI was acquired by applying the AKI-network (AKIN) classification over the course of five postoperative days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients who received the sodium bicarbonate infusion showed a significantly lower incidence (35.6 vs. 50%) of AKI than that of patients who did not receive the infusion (p = 0.01). AKIN levels 2 and 3 were also more frequent when sodium bicarbonate was not administered. Particularly, in the low-risk cohort (<3 Thakar points), the incidence of AKI was significantly reduced (26 vs. 46%) when patients received sodium bicarbonate (p = 0.01), whereas in the high-risk patients, no significant reduction was observed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this study, we observed that low-risk patients particularly benefited from the preventive treatment with sodium bicarbonate. The incidence of AKI was significantly reduced in low-risk patients while there was no statistically significant difference in the high-risk patient cohort.

Short hydration with 20 mEq of magnesium supplementation for lung cancer patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy: a prospective study.,"Tetsunari Hase, Masayuki Miyazaki, Kazuya Ichikawa, Naoyuki Yogo, Naoya Ozawa, Takahiro Hatta, Masahiko Ando, Mitsuo Sato, Masashi Kondo, Kiyofumi Yamada, Yoshinori Hasegawa, Tetsunari Haseet al.",2020 Nov,Int J Clin Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32740717/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intravenous administration of magnesium with a short hydration regimen is recommended for patients receiving high-dose cisplatin to protect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. However, the optimal dose of magnesium supplementation has not been clarified. The aim of this trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of a short hydration regimen with 20 mEq of magnesium supplementation for lung cancer patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The key eligibility criteria included cytologically or histologically diagnosed lung cancer, candidacy for cisplatin-based (≥ 60 mg/m2) chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, no prior chemotherapy, aged 20-75 years, and adequate renal function. Cisplatin was administered with pre-hydration with 20 mEq of magnesium sulfate. Mannitol was administered just before cisplatin infusion to enforce diuresis. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who underwent cisplatin-based chemotherapy with a short hydration regimen with 20 mEq of magnesium supplementation without a grade 2 or higher elevation in creatinine.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty patients with a median age of 66 years (range 35-74) were prospectively enrolled. Median baseline creatinine was 0.71 mg/dL. Median dose of cisplatin in the first cycle was 80 mg/m2. In the first cycle, no patients developed grade 2 creatinine toxicity. During the treatment period, one patient developed grade 2 creatinine elevation; thus, the proportion of patients without a grade 2 or higher elevation in creatinine was 97.5% (95% confidence interval 86.8-99.9).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A short hydration regimen with 20 mEq of magnesium supplementation is safe and feasible for patients with lung cancer receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy."
Targeted tissue perfusion versus macrocirculation-guided standard care in patients with septic shock (TARTARE-2S): study protocol and statistical analysis plan for a randomized controlled trial.,"Ville Pettilä, Tobias Merz, Erika Wilkman, Anders Perner, Sari Karlsson, Theis Lange, Johanna Hästbacka, Peter Buhl Hjortrup, Anne Kuitunen, Stephan M Jakob, Jukka Takala, Ville Pettiläet al.",2016 Aug 2:17:384.,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27484695/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Septic shock has a 90-day mortality risk of up to 50 %. The hemodynamic targets, including mean arterial pressure (MAP) are not based on robust clinical data. Both severe hypotension and high doses of vasopressors may be harmful. Hence, re-evaluation of hemodynamic targets in septic shock is relevant.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      The targeted tissue perfusion versus macrocirculation-guided standard care in patients with septic shock (TARTARE-2S) trial is a prospective, two-parallel-group, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial with assessor-blinded outcome evaluation. We will randomize at least 200 patients with septic shock in four European intensive care units (ICUs) to test whether a tissue perfusion-guided treatment strategy based on capillary refill time, peripheral temperature, arterial lactate concentrations, and accepting lower MAP levels, leads to a faster resolution of shock than macrocirculation target-guided standard care. The primary outcome measure is days alive in 30 days with normal arterial blood lactate (first value of <2 mmol/L) and without any inotropic or vasopressor agent. Secondary outcomes include individual components of the primary outcome, days alive without renal replacement, days alive without mechanical ventilation in 30 days, and new acute kidney injury. The sample size enables detection of a 13.5-h difference in the primary outcome with a type 1 error of 5 % and power of 80 %, assuming 25 % mortality and a mean of 650 h (SD 30) among the 30-day survivors. After 150 included patients the statistician masked for allocation group will recalculate the sample size potentially increasing the sample up to 300. The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the safety data after 100 patients.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The TARTARE-2S trial will provide important clinical data on treatment targets in septic shock, evaluating the impact of clinical tissue perfusion-guided hemodynamic treatment on a surrogate outcome combining resolution of shock (hyperlactatemia and vasopressors/inotropes), and 30-day mortality.

Intraoperative Use of Sodium Bicarbonate Ringer's Solution Instead of Sodium Lactate Ringer's Solution to Reduce Endothelial Glycocalyx Degradation and Improve Postoperative Recovery During Cardiopulmonary Bypass Cardiac Surgery: A Single-Center Prospective Cohort Study.,"Yujie Shi#, Yuan Shi#, Yujia Tao, Bingyan Xu, Xiaoming Wang, Yanhu Xie, Min Zhang, Yujie Shiet al.",2024 Dec 10:18:5881-5893.,Drug Des Devel Ther,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39679133/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate the effect of sodium bicarbonate Ringer's solution (BRS) on the degradation of endothelial glycocalyx components in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during cardiac surgery, and to evaluate its impact on endothelial glycocalyx preservation and postoperative recovery.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      A total of eight patients scheduled for elective CPB heart surgery were included and randomly divided into two groups: the sodium lactate Ringer's solution (LRS) group and the BRS group. ELISA was used to measure plasma concentrations of syndecan-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and TGF-β at predefined time points: T0 (before induction of anesthesia), T3 (immediately after weaning from CPB), T5 and T6 (24 and 72 hours postoperatively). Serum creatinine concentrations were measured within 48 hours postoperatively. The incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) was assessed three days after surgery. Postoperative mechanical ventilation time, duration of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital stay were also documented.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The BRS group had significantly lower plasma concentrations of syndecan-1 at T3 (7.98 [7.43, 8.92] ng/mL vs 9.54 [8.4, 10.73] ng/mL, P < 0.001) and T5 (4.20 [3.31, 4.96] ng/mL vs 5.40 [3.95, 6.55] ng/mL, P = 0.001) in comparison with the LRS group (P<0.01). Syndecan-1 levels in both groups were similar at T6 (3.18 [2.88, 3.5]ng/mL vs 3.12 [2.77, 3.45] ng/mL, P > 0.05). Additionally, MMP-9, MMP-3, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly lower at T3 and T5 in the BRS group (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) or POD (P > 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      BRS has the potential to reduce glycocalyx degradation in patients undergoing heart valve surgery with CPB. However, both groups demonstrated similar post-postoperative clinical outcomes, including the rates of AKI and POD."
Efficacy of nicorandil treatment for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac catheterization: A prospective randomized controlled trial.,"Leili Iranirad, Seyed Fakhreddin Hejazi, Mohammad Saleh Sadeghi, Shahram Arsang Jang, Leili Iraniradet al.",2017,Cardiol J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28281738/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remains to be a potentially serious complication of radiographic procedures and is the third leading cause of the acute kidney injury (AKI) among hospitalized patients. This clinical trial was performed to assess the preventive effect of oral nicorandil on CIN in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, 128 patients with at least two risk factors for CIN undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomly assigned to either the nicorandil group or the control group. Patients in the nicorandil group (n = 64) received 10 mg nicorandil, daily from 30 min before and up to 3 days after procedure and intravenous hydration for 2 h before and 6 h after the procedure, whereas patients in the control group (n = 64) just received intravenous hydration. Serum creatinine (SCr) was measured before contrast exposure and at 72 h. CIN was defined as an increase of 25% in SCr or > 0.5 mg/dL 72 h after contrast administration.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Contrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 14 out of 64 (21.9%) patients in the control group and in 3 out of 64 (4.7%) patients in the nicorandil group. There was a significant difference in the incidence of CIN between the two groups at 72 h after administering the radiocontrast agent (p = 0.008). Moreover, there were significant differences between the two groups in SCr and estimated glomerular filtration rate 72 h after radiocontrast administration (p < 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The findings revealed that oral nicorandil had substantial efficacy over hydration protocol for the development of CIN in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac catheterization."

      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is associated with proximal tubular dysfunction (tubulopathy) when used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We evaluated whether TDF causes tubulopathy when used as HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and whether tubulopathy predicts clinically relevant decline (≥25%) in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A subgroup analysis of the Partners PrEP Study, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of daily oral TDF, alone or with emtricitabine (FTC), in HIV-uninfected African men and women (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00557245). Tubulopathy was assessed in concurrently obtained urine and serum samples at the 24-month or last on-treatment visit, predefined as ≥2 of the following: tubular proteinuria, euglycemic glycosuria, increased urinary phosphate, and uric acid excretion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 1549 persons studied (776 receiving FTC-TDF, 773 receiving placebo), 64% were male, and the median age was 37 years. Over a median 24 months of study-drug exposure, the frequency of tubulopathy was 1.7% for FTC-TDF versus 1.3% for placebo (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, .52-3.33; P = .68); Tubulopathy occurred in 2 of 52 persons (3.8%) with versus 3 of 208 (1.4%) without ≥25% eGFR decline (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; .10-14.0; P > .99).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Daily oral FTC-TDF PrEP was not significantly associated with tubulopathy over the course of 24 months, nor did tubulopathy predict clinically relevant eGFR decline."

We sought to reduce toxicity and maintain efficacy by using oxaliplatin with rituximab, cytarabine and dexamethasone (ROAD) in a phase II clinical trial in patients who had relapsed after one prior regimen. ROAD was delivered q21 days and consisted of rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV weekly x 4 doses (cycle 1 only); dexamethasone 40 mg PO/IV d2 - 5; oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 IV day 2; cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 IV × two doses on days 2 to 3; and pegfilgrastim 6 mg SC on day 4. Forty-five eligible patients were accrued between 2006 and 2008. Patient characteristics were a median age of 69 years; 96% had received prior rituximab; 53% were within one year of diagnosis. The median number of cycles received was 2 (range, 1-6). Forty-four % received ROAD as an outpatient. The overall response rate was 71% with 27% (12/45) CR and 44% (20/45) PR. Forty-four % (20/45) of all patients and 69% (18/26) of patients whom responded after 2 cycles proceeded to transplant. Median overall survival was 26 mos (95% CI: 7.3 mos-not reached) and median progression-free survival was 11 mos (95% CI: 6-104 mos). There was no grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity; the rate of grade 3/4 neuropathy was 4%. Forty-two percent of all patients and 69% of patients transplanted remain alive at 5 years. ROAD represents an acceptable salvage therapeutic option for patients with relapsed aggressive NHL."

      Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a skin disorder that usually occurs among patients with a past history of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Cases are also reported without a history of VL. There is no satisfactory treatment regimen available at present. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of amphotericin B in two different doses (0.5mg/kg vs 1mg/kg) in a prospective randomized trial in 50 PKDL patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this open label study 50 patients with PKDL, aged between 5-60 years were randomized in two groups. Group A received amphotericin B in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg in 5% dextrose, daily for 20 infusions for 3 courses at an interval of 15 days between each course and Group B received amphotericin B in the dose of 1mg/kg in 5% dextrose on alternate days, 20 infusions for 3 courses an interval of 15 days between each course and followed up for one year.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 50 patients were enrolled, 25 in each of group A and group B. Two patients lost to follow up and three patients withdrew consent due to adverse events. The initial cure rate was 92% in group A and 88% in group B by intention to treat analysis and final cure rate by per protocol analysis was 95.65% and 95.45% in group A and group B respectively. Two patients each from either group relapsed. Nephrotoxicity was the most common adverse event occurring in both the groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The lower dose appears to have fewer adverse events however, nephrotoxicity remains a problem in both regimens. The 0.5mg/kg regimen may be considered instead of the higher dosage however safer treatments remain critical for PKDL treatment."
Comparison of normal saline and balanced crystalloid (plasmalyte) in patients undergoing elective craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumors: A randomized controlled trial.,"Ankita Dey, S Adinarayanan, Prasanna Udupi Bidkar, Rakesh K Bangera, V Balasubramaniyan, Ankita Deyet al.",2018 Sep-Oct,Neurol India,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30233000/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The choice of fluid is important in neurosurgical patients, who may be dehydrated due to the administration of diuretics in order to reduce cerebral edema. Normal saline, the infused fluid routinely used in neurosurgical patients, can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. A balanced crystalloid (BC) may help to maintain the metabolic status more favorably in these patients, without adversely affecting brain relaxation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial on patients undergoing elective craniotomy for supratentorial tumor resection under general anesthesia. 44 patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 22 each to receive either normal saline or BC (Plasmalyte) as the maintenance fluid, intra-operatively. The metabolic parameters and osmolality were measured at regular intervals. Brain relaxation score was assessed by the operating surgeon. The patients were monitored with serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), blood urea and serum creatinine for assessing the degree of acute kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The metabolic profile was better maintained with the BC. The brain relaxation score was comparable between the two groups. The postoperative NGAL, urea and creatinine values were significantly higher in the normal saline group compared to the BC group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The balanced crystalloid maintains metabolic status more favorably than normal saline in neurosurgical patients. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and the other problems which occur as a consequence of normal saline infusion may be circumvented by choosing a balanced crystalloid electrolyte solution. Neither of the crystalloids appeared to have any adverse effect on brain relaxation."
"The empirical antibiotic treatment of nosocomial spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial.","Salvatore Piano, Silvano Fasolato, Freddy Salinas, Antonietta Romano, Marta Tonon, Filippo Morando, Marta Cavallin, Elisabetta Gola, Antonietta Sticca, Arianna Loregian, Giorgio Palù, Giacomo Zanus, Marco Senzolo, Patrizia Burra, Umberto Cillo, Paolo Angeli, Salvatore Pianoet al.",2016 Apr,Hepatology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26084406/,No keywords found,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common, life-threatening complication of liver cirrhosis. Third-generation cephalosporins have been considered the first-line treatment of SBP. In 2014, a panel of experts suggested a broader spectrum antibiotic regimen for nosocomial SBP, according to the high rate of bacteria resistant to third-generation cephalosporins found in these patients. However, a broader-spectrum antibiotic regimen has never been compared to third-generation cephalosporins in the treatment of nosocomial SBP. The aim of our study was to compare meropenem plus daptomycin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial SBP. Patients with cirrhosis and nosocomial SBP were randomized to receive meropenem (1 g/8 hours) plus daptomycin (6 mg/kg/day) or ceftazidime (2 g/8 hours). A paracentesis was performed after 48 hours of treatment. A reduction in ascitic fluid neutrophil count <25% of pretreatment value was considered a treatment failure. The primary outcome was the efficacy of treatment defined by the resolution of SBP after 7 days of treatment. Thirty-two patients were randomized and 31 were analyzed. The combination of meropenem plus daptomycin was significantly more effective than ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial SBP (86.7 vs. 25%; P < 0.001). Ninety-day transplant-free survival (TFS) was not significantly different between the two groups. In the multivariate analysis, ineffective response to first-line treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 20.6; P = 0.01), development of acute kidney injury during hospitalization (HR: 23.2; P = 0.01), and baseline mean arterial pressure (HR: 0.92; P = 0.01) were found to be independent predictors of 90-day TFS.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The combination of meropenem plus daptomycin is more effective than ceftazidime as empirical antibiotic treatment of nosocomial SBP. Efficacy of the empirical antibiotic treatment is a strong predictor of 90-day survival in patients with nosocomial SBP."
Balanced 10% hydroxyethyl starch compared with balanced 6% hydroxyethyl starch and balanced crystalloid using a goal-directed hemodynamic algorithm in pancreatic surgery: A randomized clinical trial.,"Julia Werner, Oliver Hunsicker, Anja Schneider, Henryk Stein, Christian von Heymann, Adrian Freitag, Aarne Feldheiser, Klaus-Dieter Wernecke, Claudia Spies, Julia Werneret al.",2018 Apr,Medicine (Baltimore),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29703051/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      While hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions are not recommended any longer in critically ill patients, data on efficacy and safety during surgery are still limited.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a randomized controlled trial 63 patients were assigned to receive 10% HES (130/0.42), 6% HES (130/0.42), or crystalloid within a goal-directed hemodynamic algorithm during pancreatic surgery. The primary endpoints were intraoperative volume of HES and time until fully on oral diet.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial was terminated early upon recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee due to futility for efficacy at a planned interim analysis. The intraoperative volume of HES was not different between 10% and 6% HES group (2000 [1500; 2250] vs 2250 [1750; 3000] mL, P=.059). However, considering an inhomogeneity of patient's body weight between HES groups, there was a significant difference in intraoperative volume of HES between 10% and 6% group after adjusting for patient's body weight (24.0 [21.6; 28.3] vs 33.3 [28.2; 46.2] mL kg BW, P = .002). Patients in the HES groups required less additional fluid after dose limit than those in the crystalloid group, resulting in lower intraoperative net balances. The time until fully on oral diet was not different between all study groups. Applying KDIGO oliguria criterion, patients receiving 10% HES had more AKI compared to patients receiving crystalloids (86.7 vs 45.0%, P = .010), whereas those receiving 6% HES and crystalloids did not differ (58.8 vs 45.0%, P = .253). Further explorative analyses using a gray-zone approach indicated that patients receiving 6% HES below 18.8 mL kg will not experience AKI with near certainty.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      After adjusting for patient's body weight, patients receiving 6% HES required more volume of HES than patients receiving 10% HES. The relation of 140% represents very well the volume effect of a hyperoncotic 10% HES solution. Nonetheless, both HES solutions were similarly effective in reducing intraoperative fluid administration compared with crystalloid, but this did not result into differences in gastrointestinal outcomes. Patients receiving 10% HES showed an increased rate of AKI, whereas those receiving 6% HES and crystalloid did not differ. However, 6% HES should not be applied beyond 18 mL kg during surgery."
Evaluation the Effects of Alpha-tocopherol in Comparison with N-acetylcystein for Prevention of Contrast Induced Nephropathy (CIN) in CKD Patients.,"Katayoon Samadi, Massih Naghibi, Mahmood Shabestari, Farzaneh Sharifipour, Mohammad Khajeh Dalooee, Vajehallah Raeesi, Sara Moosavi Nik, Mohammad Samadi, Katayoon Samadiet al.",2020 Jan,Iran J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32156838/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN), a well-known complication of using radio contrast media, dramatically increases the likelihood of patient morbidity and mortality following coronary angiography. As there is no specific treatment for CIN, prevention could be the best strategy to address this issue. Since now, the only approved preventing strategy was hydration with normal saline while antioxidant agents as a new yet unapproved remedy for this purpose could be applied .The present study was conducted to examine the effect of alpha tocopherol in CIN prevention.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective controlled trial was carried out on 201 patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 60 cc/min) underwent coronary angiography. We assigned three groups of CKD patients: 72 patients who received prophylaxis administration with isotonic saline (Group A), 66 patients with isotonic saline plus N-acetylcysteine (1200mg twice a day) for 2 days (Group B) and 63 patients who received isotonic saline plus daily alpha tocopherol (600 IU once daily from one day before till 2 days after angiography) for 4 days (Group C). The contrast media in all three groups was nonionic iso-osmolal agent, Visipaque.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Even though CIN didn't developed in any of the three aforementioned groups but there was statistically significant reduction in eGFR from baseline in all three groups (P < .001). Moreover, We found no statistically significant difference in GFR reduction between three studied groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Administration of alpha tocopherol has no additive beneficial effect over isotonic saline in CIN prevention in CKD patients."

      The non-interventional study CONIFER was designed to assess the safety and clinical practicability of deferasirox for the treatment of transfusional iron overload in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients included in the study were diagnosed with MDS and received at least 1 treatment with deferasirox. The observation period covered the time from the initial visit until the last follow-up.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The data of 99 patients with MDS scored mainly as International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low and intermediate 1 were evaluated. The mean age of the participants was 75 years and 58% of the patients were male. Iron overload was assessed by serum ferritin level (mean baseline serum ferritin 2,080 ± 1,244 µg/l). Patients were treated for a mean duration of 16 months (mean daily dose at baseline 11.8 ± 7.0 mg/kg). Stratification of serum ferritin levels by deferasirox dose showed a reduction at the higher but no reduction at the lower dose (< 15 mg/kg vs. ≥ 15 mg/kg and < 20 mg/kg vs. ≥ 20 mg/kg). The majority of patients (81%) were affected by at least 1 adverse event, with decreased renal creatinine clearance being the most frequent.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Higher doses (≥ 15 mg/kg) of deferasirox effectively and safely reduced serum ferritin levels in MDS patients with transfusional iron overload."

      To evaluate comprehensively the safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with emphasis placed on potential safety concerns related to the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor class.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In the Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE-TIMI 58) study, 17 160 patients with T2DM were randomized to dapagliflozin or placebo and followed for a median of 4.2 years. Safety was evaluated in 17 143 patients receiving at least one dose of study drug.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury occurred less frequently with dapagliflozin, and adverse events suggestive of volume depletion were balanced between treatment groups, both irrespective of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, diuretic or loop diuretic use (interaction P values >0.05). Fractures and malignancies were balanced between the groups, irrespective of sex, diabetes duration or smoking (interaction P values >0.05) and fewer cases of bladder cancer occurred in the dapagliflozin versus the placebo group. Diabetic ketoacidosis was very rare, but more frequent with dapagliflozin versus placebo (27 vs. 12 patients with events; P = 0.02), yet signs, symptoms and contributing factors were similar in the two groups. Major hypoglycaemia occurred less frequently with dapagliflozin versus placebo, regardless of baseline use of either insulin or sulphonylureas (interaction P values >0.05). There were more adverse events of genital infections leading to discontinuation of study drug in the dapagliflozin versus the placebo group, but serious genital infections were few and balanced between treatment groups. Urinary tract infections, acute pyelonephritis and urosepsis were also balanced between treatment groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dapagliflozin was well tolerated. The long duration and large number of patient-years in DECLARE-TIMI 58 comprehensively addressed previous safety questions, confirming the robust safety profile of dapagliflozin."

Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older, who had hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who had previously received at least two HER2-targeted therapies for advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to the abemaciclib, trastuzumab, and fulvestrant (group A), abemaciclib and trastuzumab (group B), or standard-of-care chemotherapy and trastuzumab (group C). Oral abemaciclib 150 mg 12 hourly was administered on days 1-21 of a 21-day cycle, intravenous trastuzumab 8 mg/kg on cycle 1 day 1, followed by 6 mg/kg on day 1 of each subsequent 21-day cycle, and intramuscular fulvestrant 500 mg on days 1, 15, and 29 and once every 4 weeks thereafter. Standard-of-care chemotherapy was administered as specified by the product label. Randomisation was by a computer-generated random sequence by means of an interactive web-response system and stratified by number of previous systemic therapies for advanced breast cancer and measurable versus non-measurable disease. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, first testing group A versus group C and, if this result was significant, then group B versus group C. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02675231) and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between May 31, 2016, and Feb 28, 2018, 325 patients were screened, of whom 237 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to groups A (n=79), B (n=79), and C (n=79). Median follow-up was 19·0 months (IQR 14·7-25·1). The study met its primary endpoint, showing a significant difference at the prespecified two-sided α of 0·2 in median progression-free survival between group A (8·3 months, 95% CI 5·9-12·6) and group C (5·7 months, 5·4-7·0; HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·45-1·00]; p=0·051). No difference was observed between median progression-free survival in group B (5·7 months, 95% CI 4·2-7·2) and group C (HR 0·94 [0·64-1·38]; p=0·77). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse event in groups A, B, and C was neutropenia (21 [27%] of 78 patients, 17 [22%] of 77, and 19 [26%] of 72). The most common serious adverse events were: in group A, pyrexia (three [4%]), diarrhoea (two [3%]), urinary tract infection (two [3%]), and acute kidney injury (two [3%]); in group B, diarrhoea (two [3%]) and pneumonitis (two [3%]); and in group C, neutropenia (four [6%]) and pleural effusion (two [3%]). Two deaths were attributed to treatment: one due to pulmonary fibrosis in group B and one due to febrile neutropenia in group C.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      The combination of abemaciclib, fulvestrant, and trastuzumab significantly improved progression-free survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy plus trastuzumab while showing a tolerable safety profile. Our results suggest that a chemotherapy-free regimen might potentially be an alternative treatment option for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.

Interleukin-1 Receptor Blockade Is Associated With Reduced Mortality in Sepsis Patients With Features of Macrophage Activation Syndrome: Reanalysis of a Prior Phase III Trial.,"Bita Shakoory, Joseph A Carcillo, W Winn Chatham, Richard L Amdur, Huaqing Zhao, Charles A Dinarello, Randall Q Cron, Steven M Opal, Bita Shakooryet al.",2016 Feb,Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26584195/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine the efficacy of anakinra (recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) in improving 28-day survival in sepsis patients with features of macrophage activation syndrome. Despite equivocal results in sepsis trials, anakinra is effective in treating macrophage activation syndrome, a similar entity with fever, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatobiliary dysfunction, cytopenias, and hyperferritinemia. Hence, sepsis patients with macrophage activation syndrome features may benefit from interleukin-1 receptor blockade.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Reanalysis of deidentified data from the phase III randomized interleukin-1 receptor antagonist trial in severe sepsis.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Multicenter study recruiting through 91 centers from 11 countries in Europe and North America.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Sepsis patients with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and/or shock (original study) were regrouped based on the presence or the absence of concurrent hepatobiliary dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation as features of macrophage activation syndrome. The non-hepatobiliary dysfunction/disseminated intravascular coagulation group included patients with only hepatobiliary dysfunction, only disseminated intravascular coagulation, or neither.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Treatment with anakinra or placebo.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Main outcome was 28-day mortality. Descriptive and comparative statistics were performed. Data were available for 763 adults from the original study cohort, randomized to receive either anakinra or placebo. Concurrent hepatobiliary dysfunction/disseminated intravascular coagulation was noted in 43 patients (5.6% of total; 18-75 years old; 47% women). The 28-day survival was similar in both anakinra and placebo-treated non-hepatobiliary dysfunction/disseminated intravascular coagulation patients (71.4% vs 70.8%; p = 0.88). Treatment with anakinra was associated with significant improvement in the 28-day survival rate in hepatobiliary dysfunction/disseminated intravascular coagulation patients (65.4% anakinra vs 35.3% placebo), with hazard ratio for death 0.28 (0.11-0.71; p = 0.0071) for the treatment group in Cox regression.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this subgroup analysis, interleukin-1 receptor blockade was associated with significant improvement in survival of patients with sepsis and concurrent hepatobiliary dysfunction/disseminated intravascular coagulation. A prospective randomized trial using features of macrophage activation syndrome for mortality risk stratification should be undertaken to confirm the role of interleukin-1 blockage."
High cutoff versus high-flux haemodialysis for myeloma cast nephropathy in patients receiving bortezomib-based chemotherapy (EuLITE): a phase 2 randomised controlled trial.,"Colin A Hutchison, Paul Cockwell, Veronica Moroz, Arthur R Bradwell, Lesley Fifer, Julian D Gillmore, Mark D Jesky, Markus Storr, Julie Wessels, Christopher G Winearls, Katja Weisel, Nils Heyne, Mark Cook, Colin A Hutchisonet al.",2019 Apr,Lancet Haematol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30872075/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      In multiple myeloma, severe acute kidney injury due to myeloma cast nephropathy is caused by pathogenic free light chain immunoglobulin in serum. High cutoff haemodialysis (HCO-HD) can remove large quantities of free light chain immunoglobulin from serum, but its effect on clinical outcomes is uncertain. We therefore aimed to assess whether HCO-HD could increase the frequency of renal recovery in patients with de novo multiple myeloma, severe acute kidney injury, and myeloma cast nephropathy relative to treatment with standard high-flux haemodialysis (HF-HD).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this open-label, phase 2, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (EuLITE), we recruited patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, biopsy-confirmed cast nephropathy, and acute kidney injury that required dialysis from renal services in 16 hospitals in the UK and Germany. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by random number generation to receive intensive HCO-HD (in sessions lasting 6-8 h) or standard HF-HD and they were stratified by age and centre. Patients and the medical staff treating them were not masked to treatment allocation. Patients received bortezomib, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone chemotherapy, and were then followed up for 2 years. The primary outcome was independence from dialysis at 90 days after random allocation to groups, which was assessed in an intention-to-treat population. The trial has completed follow-up, and is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN45967602.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between June 7, 2008, and Sept 18, 2013, we recruited 90 patients, of whom 43 (48%) were randomly assigned to receive HCO-HD and 47 (52%) were randomly assigned to receive HF-HD. All 90 patients were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. One (2%) patient from the HF-HD group withdrew consent before receiving treatment. During treatment, nine (21%) patients from the HCO-HD group and two (4%) patients in the HF-HD group discontinued trial treatment. After 90 days, 24 (56%) patients in the HCO-HD group and 24 (51%) patients in the HF-HD group were independent from dialysis (relative risk 1·09, 95% CI 0·74-1·61; p=0·81). During the 2-year follow-up, 98 serious adverse events were reported in the HCO-HD group and 82 serious adverse events were reported in the HF-HD group. The most common serious adverse events were infections and adverse events related to the cardiovascular and thrombotic and musculoskeletal systems. During the first 90 days, 26 infections were reported in the HCO-HD group and 13 infections were reported in the HF-HD group, including 14 lung infections in the HCO-HD group and three lung infections in the HF-HD group.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      In this phase 2 study, HCO-HD did not improve clinical outcomes for patients with de novo multiple myeloma and myeloma cast nephropathy who required haemodialysis for acute kidney injury and who received a bortezomib-based chemotherapy regimen relative to those receiving HF-HD. These results do not support proceeding to a phase 3 study for HCO-HD in these patients.

The SPRINT trial suggests that markers of tubule cell function in the urine associate with risk of subsequent acute kidney injury while injury markers elevate after the injury.,"Alexander L Bullen, Ronit Katz, Alexandra K Lee, Cheryl A M Anderson, Alfred K Cheung, Pranav S Garimella, Vasantha Jotwani, William E Haley, Areef Ishani, James P Lash, Javier A Neyra, Henry Punzi, Anjay Rastogi, Erik Riessen, Rakesh Malhotra, Chirag R Parikh, Michael V Rocco, Barry M Wall, Udayan Y Bhatt, Michael G Shlipak, Joachim H Ix, Michelle M Estrella, Alexander L Bullenet al.",2019 Aug,Kidney Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31262489/,"acute kidney injury, alpha-1 microglobulin, beta-2 microglobulin, chitinase-3-like protein, interleukin-18, kidney injury molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, uromodulin.","Urine markers can quantify tubular function including reabsorption (α-1 microglobulin [α1m]) and β-2-microglobulin [β2m]) and protein synthesis (uromodulin). Individuals with tubular dysfunction may be less able to compensate to insults than those without, despite similar estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. Among Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) participants with an eGFR under 60 ml/min/1.73m2, we measured urine markers of tubular function and injury (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL], kidney injury molecule-1 [KIM-1], interleukin-18 [IL-18], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and chitinase-3-like protein [YKL-40]) at baseline. Cox models evaluated associations with subsequent acute kidney injury (AKI) risk, adjusting for clinical risk factors, baseline eGFR and albuminuria, and the tubular function and injury markers. In a random subset, we remeasured biomarkers after four years, and compared changes in biomarkers in those with and without intervening AKI. Among 2351 participants, 184 experienced AKI during 3.8 years mean follow-up. Lower uromodulin (hazard ratio per two-fold higher (0.68, 95% confidence interval [0.56, 0.83]) and higher α1m (1.20; [1.01, 1.44]) were associated with subsequent AKI, independent of eGFR and albuminuria. None of the five injury markers were associated with eventual AKI. In the random subset of 947 patients with repeated measurements, the 59 patients with intervening AKI versus without had longitudinal increases in urine NGAL, IL-19, and YKL-40 and only 1 marker of tubule function (α1m). Thus, joint evaluation of tubule function and injury provided novel insights to factors predisposing to AKI, and responses to kidney injury."
Effect of standard dose paracetamol versus placebo as antipyretic therapy on liver injury in adult dengue infection: a multicentre randomised controlled trial.,"Vasin Vasikasin, Thanawith Rojdumrongrattana, Worayon Chuerboonchai, Thanawhan Siriwiwattana, Wittaya Thongtaeparak, Suchada Niyasom, Nawarat Lertliewtrakool, Sitawee Jitsiri, Dhitiwat Changpradub, Vasin Vasikasinet al.",2019 May,Lancet Glob Health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31000133/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Dengue is a common cause of acute liver failure in tropical countries. Paracetamol is the recommended antipyretic for dengue. Related observational studies in dengue have suggested that excessive paracetamol intake is related to hepatic injury. We aimed to evaluate whether standard dose paracetamol as an antipyretic in dengue infection caused transaminase elevation, and to evaluate the efficacy of paracetamol.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult participants (aged ≥18 years) with dengue, as confirmed by either positive NS1 antigen, positive dengue IgM antigen with thrombocytopenia, or positive PCR test, were enrolled at three Royal Thai Army hospitals in Thailand. Key exclusion criteria were baseline AST or ALT concentrations of more than 3 times the upper limit of normal, cirrhosis, indication of paracetamol other than dengue infection, concurrent diagnosis of other causes of fever, or pregnancy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by a computer-generated block randomisation procedure (block size of six), to receive either paracetamol (500 mg) or placebo (500 mg) every 4 h when body temperature exceeded 38°C during hospitalisation. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with transaminase elevation, defined as serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) concentrations of more than 3 times the upper limit of normal on recovery day, in the intention-to-treat population. Prespecified interim analyses for safety and efficacy were performed with group sequential stopping boundaries. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02833584.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Sept 1, 2016, and Dec 12, 2017, 125 participants were randomly assigned to receive either paracetamol (n=63) or placebo (n=62). 123 participants were included in the intention-to-treat population. The median daily dose of study medication was 1·5 g (IQR 0·8-2·0). The study was terminated early owing to a higher rate of transaminase elevation in the paracetamol group than in the placebo group (22% vs 10%; incidence rate ratio 3·77, 95% CI 1·36-10·46, p=0·011). The change of AST and ALT concentrations in the paracetamol group was higher than in the placebo group (mean difference 12·43 U/L per day, 7·16-17·71, p<0·0001 for AST; 7·40 U/L per day, 95% CI 3·68-11·13, p=0·0001 for ALT). Three participants in the paracetamol group had severe dengue: two had upper gastric haemorrhage and one had acute kidney injury. No patients died or had liver failure.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Use of standard dose paracetamol in dengue infection increased the incidence of transaminase elevation, and also overall transaminase concentrations in the absence of a counterbalancing reduced fever or pain score.

A pilot study evaluating GSK1070806 inhibition of interleukin-18 in renal transplant delayed graft function.,"E Wlodek, R B Kirkpatrick, S Andrews, R Noble, R Schroyer, J Scott, C J E Watson, M Clatworthy, E M Harrison, S J Wigmore, K Stevenson, D Kingsmore, N S Sheerin, O Bestard, H A Stirnadel-Farrant, L Abberley, M Busz, S DeWall, M Birchler, D Krull, K S Thorneloe, A Weber, L Devey, E Wlodeket al.",2021 Mar 8,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33684160/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Delayed graft function (DGF) following renal transplantation is a manifestation of acute kidney injury (AKI) leading to poor long-term outcome. Current treatments have limited effectiveness in preventing DGF. Interleukin-18 (IL18), a biomarker of AKI, induces interferon-γ expression and immune activation. GSK1070806, an anti-IL18 monoclonal antibody, neutralizes activated (mature) IL18 released from damaged cells following inflammasome activation. This phase IIa, single-arm trial assessed the effect of a single dose of GSK1070806 on DGF occurrence post donation after circulatory death (DCD) kidney transplantation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The 3 mg/kg intravenous dose was selected based on prior studies and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, indicating the high likelihood of a rapid and high level of IL18 target engagement when administered prior to kidney allograft reperfusion. Utilization of a Bayesian sequential design with a background standard-of-care DGF rate of 50% based on literature, and confirmed via extensive registry data analyses, enabled a statistical efficacy assessment with a minimal sample size. The primary endpoint was DGF frequency, defined as dialysis requirement ≤7 days post transplantation (except for hyperkalemia). Secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      GSK1070806 administration was associated with IL18-GSK1070806 complex detection and increased total serum IL18 levels due to IL18 half-life prolongation induced by GSK1070806 binding. Interferon-γ-induced chemokine levels declined or remained unchanged in most patients. Although the study was concluded prior to the Bayesian-defined stopping point, 4/7 enrolled patients (57%) had DGF, exceeding the 50% standard-of-care rate, and an additional two patients, although not reaching the protocol-defined DGF definition, demonstrated poor graft function. Six of seven patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs), including two treatment-related SAEs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Overall, using a Bayesian design and extensive PBPK dose modeling with only a small sample size, it was deemed unlikely that GSK1070806 would be efficacious in preventing DGF in the enrolled DCD transplant population.

      Previous clinical trials have suggested that bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase has renal protective effects in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. We conducted a first-in-human study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a novel human recombinant alkaline phosphatase (recAP), and we developed a population pharmacokinetic model to support dose selection for future patient studies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I trial, healthy volunteers received a single dose of recAP (200, 500, 1000 or 2000 U/kg; n = 33; 3:1 ratio) or multiple doses of recAP (500 or 1000 U/kg; n = 18; 2:1 ratio) via a 1-h intravenous infusion on three consecutive days. Serum recAP concentrations, alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity levels and anti-drug antibodies were measured, and safety parameters were monitored. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed, and simulations were performed to guide dose selection for a phase IIa/b trial.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Peak concentrations of recAP and peak AP activity were reached at the end of the 1-h infusion and showed a rapid decline, with about 10 % of the maximum concentration remaining at 4 h and less than 5 % remaining 24 h post-start. RecAP treatment was generally well tolerated, and anti-drug antibodies could not be detected in the serum up to 2 weeks post-injection after a single dose, or up to 3 weeks post-injection after multiple doses. A four-compartment model best described the pharmacokinetics of recAP administration, with moderate inter-individual variability on the central volume of distribution and elimination rate constant. Simulations showed that 1-h intravenous infusions of 250, 500 and 1000 U/kg recAP once every 24 h for three consecutive days constituted the dosing regimen that best met the criteria for dose selection in patient studies.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      RecAP did not raise any safety concerns when administered to healthy volunteers. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed to support dose selection for patient studies.

Chlorthalidone vs Hydrochlorothiazide and Kidney Outcomes in Patients With Hypertension: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Areef Ishani, Cynthia Hau, Srihari Raju, Jessica K Wise, Peter A Glassman, Addison A Taylor, Ryan E Ferguson, William C Cushman, Sarah M Leatherman, Areef Ishaniet al.",2024 Dec 2,JAMA Netw Open,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39656458/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Hypertension is a risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear whether different thiazide diuretics have a differential impact on kidney outcomes.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension taking chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This prespecified secondary analysis of the Diuretic Comparison Project, a randomized clinical trial comparing chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension, was conducted between June 1, 2016, and June 1, 2022, through Veterans Affairs facilities nationwide. This analysis extended follow-up to December 31, 2023. Veterans 65 years or older with hypertension who were taking hydrochlorothiazide were included.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      The Diuretic Comparison Project randomized 13 523 participants to continue hydrochlorothiazide or switch to chlorthalidone.
    


          Main outcome and measures:
        
      
      The main kidney outcome was CKD progression, defined as doubling of serum creatinine level from baseline, a terminal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 15 mL/min, or dialysis initiation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Analysis included 12 265 participants (90.7%) with a baseline and 1 or more follow-up creatinine measurements (median [IQR] age, 71 [69-75] years; 3.2% female and 96.8% male). The mean (SD) study duration was 3.9 (1.3) years. Chlorthalidone was not superior to hydrochlorothiazide at preventing kidney outcomes (369 of 6118 [6.0%] vs 396 of 6147 [6.4%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81-1.08; P = .37). Similar results were observed when a 40% or greater reduction of eGFR was substituted for doubling of creatinine in the above outcome, as well as any of the components of the primary composite outcome. There was no difference in the incidence of CKD (961 of 4520 [21.3%] for chlorthalidone vs 939 of 4518 [20.8%] for hydrochlorothiazide; P = .59) or acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization (391 [6.4%] for chlorthalidone vs 379 [6.2%] for hydrochlorothiazide; P = .63) between groups. However, a statistically significant increased incidence of hypokalemia for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide was observed (545 [8.9%] vs 426 [6.9%]; P < .001).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Chlorthalidone was not superior to hydrochlorothiazide for kidney outcomes but was associated with an increased risk for hypokalemia. Given these findings, clinicians should feel confident using either agent for the treatment of hypertension and kidney outcomes.

Noncompletion was largely due to virological failure [6.2% (33) with d4T/3TC/EFV versus 5.4% (29) with TDF/3TC/EFV; P = 0.60]. For the primary endpoint, d4T/3TC/EFV was noninferior to TDF/3TC/EFV (79.3%, 425/536 versus 80.8% 433/536; difference = -1.49%, 95% CI: -6.3 to 3.3; P < 0.001). Drug-related adverse event discontinuations were higher with d4T (6.7%, 36), than TDF (1.1%, 6; P < 0.001). Lipodystrophy was more common with d4T (5.6%, 30) than TDF (0.2%, 1; P < 0.001). Creatinine clearance increased in both arms, by 18.1 mL/min in the d4T arm and 14.2 mL/min with TDF (P = 0.03). Hip bone density measures, however, showed greater loss with TDF.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Low-dose d4T combined with 3TC/EFV demonstrated noninferior virological efficacy compared with TDF/3TC/EFV, but mitochondrial toxicity remained high. Little renal toxicity occurred in either arm. Implications of bone mineral density changes with TDF warrant investigation."
"Chemoimmunotherapy with methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa, and rituximab (MATRix regimen) in patients with primary CNS lymphoma: results of the first randomisation of the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group-32 (IELSG32) phase 2 trial.","Andrés J M Ferreri, Kate Cwynarski, Elisa Pulczynski, Maurilio Ponzoni, Martina Deckert, Letterio S Politi, Valter Torri, Christopher P Fox, Paul La Rosée, Elisabeth Schorb, Achille Ambrosetti, Alexander Roth, Claire Hemmaway, Angela Ferrari, Kim M Linton, Roberta Rudà, Mascha Binder, Tobias Pukrop, Monica Balzarotti, Alberto Fabbri, Peter Johnson, Jette Sønderskov Gørløv, Georg Hess, Jens Panse, Francesco Pisani, Alessandra Tucci, Stephan Stilgenbauer, Bernd Hertenstein, Ulrich Keller, Stefan W Krause, Alessandro Levis, Hans J Schmoll, Franco Cavalli, Jürgen Finke, Michele Reni, Emanuele Zucca, Gerald Illerhaus                              ;, International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG), Andrés J M Ferreriet al.",2016 May,Lancet Haematol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27132696/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Standard treatment for patients with primary CNS lymphoma remains to be defined. Active therapies are often associated with increased risk of haematological or neurological toxicity. In this trial, we addressed the tolerability and efficacy of adding rituximab with or without thiotepa to methotrexate-cytarabine combination therapy (the MATRix regimen), followed by a second randomisation comparing consolidation with whole-brain radiotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with primary CNS lymphoma. We report the results of the first randomisation in this Article.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      For the international randomised phase 2 International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group-32 (IELSG32) trial, HIV-negative patients (aged 18-70 years) with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma and measurable disease were enrolled from 53 cancer centres in five European countries (Denmark, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the UK) and randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive four courses of methotrexate 3·5 g/m(2) on day 1 plus cytarabine 2 g/m(2) twice daily on days 2 and 3 (group A); or the same combination plus two doses of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on days -5 and 0 (group B); or the same methotrexate-cytarabine-rituximab combination plus thiotepa 30 mg/m(2) on day 4 (group C), with the three groups repeating treatment every 3 weeks. Patients with responsive or stable disease after the first stage were then randomly allocated between whole-brain radiotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. A permuted blocks randomised design (block size four) was used for both randomisations, and a computer-generated randomisation list was used within each stratum to preserve allocation concealment. Randomisation was stratified by IELSG risk score (low vs intermediate vs high). No masking after assignment to intervention was used. The primary endpoint of the first randomisation was the complete remission rate, analysed by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01011920.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Feb 19, 2010, and Aug 27, 2014, 227 eligible patients were recruited. 219 of these 227 enrolled patients were assessable. At median follow-up of 30 months (IQR 22-38), patients treated with rituximab and thiotepa had a complete remission rate of 49% (95% CI 38-60), compared with 23% (14-31) of those treated with methotrexate-cytarabine alone (hazard ratio 0·46, 95% CI 0·28-0·74) and 30% (21-42) of those treated with methotrexate-cytarabine plus rituximab (0·61, 0·40-0·94). Grade 4 haematological toxicity was more frequent in patients treated with methotrexate-cytarabine plus rituximab and thiotepa, but infective complications were similar in the three groups. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in all three groups were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and febrile neutropenia or infections. 13 (6%) patients died of toxicity.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      With the limitations of a randomised phase 2 study design, the IELSG32 trial provides a high level of evidence supporting the use of MATRix combination as the new standard chemoimmunotherapy for patients aged up to 70 years with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma and as the control group for future randomised trials.

SPR206 is a novel polymyxin derivative with potent in vitro and in vivo activity against A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and multiple clinically important species of Enterobacterales, including multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant strains. This was a first-in-human (FIH) double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-, and multiple-ascending-dose study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SPR206 in 94 healthy subjects. Following intravenous (i.v.) administration (1-h infusion) at single doses of 10 mg to 400 mg and multiple doses of 25 mg to 150 mg every 8 h (q8h) for 7 days and 100 mg q8h for 14 days, SPR206 was generally safe and generally well tolerated. While the incidence of adverse events increased with dose, most were of mild severity. Systemic exposure (maximum concentration of drug in serum [Cmax] and area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) to SPR206 was approximately dose proportional, time to peak concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 h, and half-life ranged from 2.4 to 4.1 h. No appreciable accumulation occurred with repeated dosing of SPR206, and trough concentrations suggest that steady state was achieved by day 2. Urinary excretion of unchanged SPR206 was dose dependent across single- (SAD) and multiple-ascending-dose (MAD) cohorts, and the percentage of dose excreted as SPR206 was up to >50%. Importantly, no evidence of nephrotoxicity was observed over 14 days of 100 mg q8h dosing of SPR206; a dosing regimen anticipated to exceed requirements for clinical efficacy.

      We investigated whether preexisting kidney function determines if ICU patients may benefit from increased (2.0 g/kg/d) protein intake.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Post hoc, hypothesis-generating, subgroup analysis of a multicenter, phase 2, randomized clinical trial. All analyses were conducted by intention to treat and maintained group allocation. Ninety-day mortality was the primary outcome.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      ICUs of 16 hospitals throughout Australia and New Zealand.
    


          Patients:

          Interventions:
        
      
      Random allocation to receive a daily supplement of up to 100 g of IV amino acids to achieve a total protein intake of 2.0 g/kg/d or standard nutrition care.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      A total of 474 patients were randomized: 235 to standard care and 239 to IV amino acid supplementation. There was a statistically significant interaction between baseline kidney function and supplementation with study amino acids (p value for interaction = 0.026). Within the subgroup of patients with normal kidney function at randomization, patients who were allocated to receive the study amino acid supplement were less likely to die before study day 90 (covariate-adjusted risk difference, -7.9%; 95% CI, -15.1 to -0.7; p = 0.034). Furthermore, amino acid supplementation significantly increased estimated glomerular filtration rate in these patients (repeated-measures treatment × time interaction p = 0.009). Within the subgroup of patients with baseline kidney dysfunction and/or risk of progression of acute kidney injury, a significant effect of the study intervention on mortality was not found (covariate-adjusted risk difference, -0.6%; 95% CI, -16.2 to 15.2; p = 0.95).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this post hoc, hypothesis-generating, subgroup analysis, we observed reduced mortality and improved estimated glomerular filtration rate in ICU patients with normal kidney function who were randomly allocated to receive increased protein intake (up to 2.0 g/kg/d). We strongly recommend confirmation of these results in trials with low risk of bias before this treatment is recommended for routine care."
Effects of pharmacist intervention in Vancomycin treatment for patients with bacteremia due to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.,"Atsushi Komoto, Takayoshi Maiguma, Daisuke Teshima, Tetsuhiro Sugiyama, Yuto Haruki, Atsushi Komotoet al.",2018 Sep 6,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30188918/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      We conducted a retrospective study based on composite endpoints for treatment failure to evaluate the effect of pharmacist-led VCM initial dose planning for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective cohort study was performed between pharmacist intervention and non-intervention groups. In this study, four types of failure were defined as the composite endpoint. When any one of the following failures occurred: 1) Death within 30 days from the start of VCM therapy, 2) Positive blood culture 7 days after the start of VCM therapy, 3) Change of VCM to another anti-MRSA agent, and 4) Development of nephrotoxicity, we considered that VCM treatment had failed. Survival time analysis was conducted with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazard model that included seven predefined parameters: pharmacist intervention, age, sex, weight, baseline VCM trough concentration, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Pitt Bacteremia score (PBS). The effect of pharmacist intervention was studied as the survival probability estimated from the period of time from the start of VCM administration to the earliest failure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The survival rate at 30 days after starting VCM therapy, at the end of follow-up, was 53.1 and 82.1% in the non-intervention and intervention groups, respectively. A significant survival time prolongation was noted in the intervention group (p = 0.011, log rank test). Among the seven parameters, only pharmacist intervention was significantly different and its hazard ratio was 0.26 (p = 0.014). The survival probability of the intervention group was higher than that of the non-intervention group for the time to each failure. In subgroup analyses, a significant difference was noted in male patients between the intervention and non-intervention groups (p = 0.005). Age was categorized into those under and over 65 years old. For those over 65 years old, a significant difference was shown between the groups (p = 0.018).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the failure of VCM treatment based on the composite endpoint. Pharmacist intervention through the initial VCM dose planning could maintain a balance between the efficacy and safety of VCM treatment and might avoid treatment failure for patients with MRSA bacteremia. Further investigations with large sample sizes are required to confirm our findings."
Effects of a DPP4 inhibitor on cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Seon Ha Baek, Se Hyun Kim, Jin Won Kim, Yu Jung Kim, Keun-Wook Lee, Ki Young Na, Seon Ha Baeket al.",2015 May 29:16:239.,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26021829/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent, but its nephrotoxicity, which results in acute kidney injury (AKI), often limits its clinical application. Although many studies have attempted to target the mechanism responsible for its nephrotoxicity, no such method has been demonstrated to be effective in clinical trials. Recently, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor has been reported to have a renoprotective effect in a mouse model of cisplatin-induced AKI. Therefore, we will evaluate whether a DPP4 inhibitor protects the kidney from cisplatin-induced injury in humans.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 182 participants who are scheduled for cisplatin treatment will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either a DPP4 inhibitor (gemigliptin) or a placebo. Participants will take the study drugs for 8 days starting 1 day before cisplatin treatment. The primary outcome of interest is the incidence of AKI at 7 days after finishing treatment with cisplatin. The secondary outcomes include changes in serum creatinine levels and estimated glomerular filtration rates from baseline to 7 days after cisplatin treatment.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This is the first clinical trial to investigate the effect of a DPP4 inhibitor on cisplatin-induced AKI.

      The early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an unmet clinical need. Proenkephalin (PENK) might improve the early detection of AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred and eleven hospitalized CKD patients undergoing radiographic contrast procedures were enrolled. PENK was measured in a blinded fashion at baseline (before contrast media administration) and on day 1 (after contrast media administration). The potential of PENK levels to predict contrast-induced AKI was the primary endpoint.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline creatinine and baseline PENK were similar in AKI and no-AKI patients. In AKI patients, day 1 PENK (198 pmol/L vs 121 pmol/L, P < 0.01) was significantly higher compared to no-AKI patients. The area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of AKI by day 1 PENK was 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70-0.87, similar to serum creatinine: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.61-0.95. Delta PENK was significantly higher in AKI compared to no-AKI patients (53 pmol/L vs 1 pmol/L, P < 0.01). The AUC for the prediction of AKI by delta PENK was high (0.92, 95%CI 0.82-1.00) and remained high for creatinine-blind AKI (0.94, 95% CI: 0.87-0.97).

      Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions and rearrangements are clinically actionable genomic alterations in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Pemigatinib is a selective, potent, oral inhibitor of FGFR1-3 and demonstrated efficacy in patients with previously treated, advanced/metastatic CCA with FGFR2 alterations in FIGHT-202 (NCT02924376). We report final outcomes from the extended follow-up period.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      The multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II FIGHT-202 study enrolled patients ≥18 years old with previously treated advanced/metastatic CCA with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements (cohort A), other FGF/FGFR alterations (cohort B), or no FGF/FGFR alterations (cohort C). Patients received once-daily oral pemigatinib 13.5 mg in 21-day cycles (2 weeks on, 1 week off) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) in cohort A assessed as per RECIST v1.1 by an independent review committee; secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.
    


          Results:
        
      
      FIGHT-202 enrolled 147 patients (cohort A, 108; cohort B, 20; cohort C, 17; unconfirmed FGF/FGFR alterations, 2). By final analysis, 145 (98.6%) had discontinued treatment due to progressive disease (71.4%), withdrawal by patient (8.2%), or adverse events (AEs; 6.8%). Median follow-up was 45.4 months. The ORR in cohort A was 37.0% (95% confidence interval 27.9% to 46.9%); complete and partial responses were observed in 3 and 37 patients, respectively. Median DOR was 9.1 (6.0-14.5) months; median PFS and OS were 7.0 (6.1-10.5) months and 17.5 (14.4-22.9) months, respectively. The most common treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were hyperphosphatemia (58.5%), alopecia (49.7%), and diarrhea (47.6%). Overall, 15 (10.2%) patients experienced TEAEs leading to pemigatinib discontinuation; intestinal obstruction and acute kidney injury (n = 2 each) occurred most frequently.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pemigatinib demonstrated durable response and prolonged OS with manageable AEs in patients with previously treated, advanced/metastatic CCA with FGFR2 alterations in the extended follow-up period of FIGHT-202."

          Patients:
        
      
      Critically ill patients with stable renal function (n = 307) who received intravascular contrast media.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Hydration with 0.9% sodium chloride or 1.4% sodium bicarbonate administered with the same infusion protocol: 3 mL/kg during 1 hour before and 1 mL/kg/hr during 6 hours after contrast medium exposure.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      The primary endpoint was the development of contrast-associated acute kidney injury, as defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria, 72 hours after contrast exposure. Patients randomized to the bicarbonate group (n = 151) showed a higher urinary pH at the end of the infusion than patients randomized to the saline group (n = 156) (6.7 ± 2.1 vs 6.2 ± 1.8, respectively; p < 0.0001). The frequency of contrast-associated acute kidney injury was similar in both groups: 52 patients (33.3%) in the saline group and 53 patients (35.1%) in the bicarbonate group (absolute risk difference, -1.8%; 95% CI [-12.3% to 8.9%]; p = 0.81). The need for renal replacement therapy (five [3.2%] and six [3.9%] patients; p = 0.77), ICU length of stay (24.7 ± 22.9 and 23 ± 23.8 d; p = 0.52), and mortality (25 [16.0%] and 24 [15.9%] patients; p > 0.99) were also similar between the saline and bicarbonate groups, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Except for urinary pH, none of the outcomes differed between the two groups. Among ICU patients with stable renal function, the benefit of using sodium bicarbonate rather than isotonic sodium chloride for preventing contrast-associated acute kidney injury is marginal, if any."

Furosap (FS), an innovative, patented, 20% protodioscin-enriched extract was developed in our laboratory from fenugreek seeds. This study examined the free and total testosterone levels, sperm profile and morphology, sexual health, mood and mental alertness, and broad spectrum safety parameters of FS in 50 male volunteers following supplementation over a period of 12 weeks. Methods: Institutional Review Board (IRB) and other regulatory approvals were obtained for our study. This one-arm, open-labelled, multi-center study was conducted in 50 male volunteers (age: 35 to 65 years) over a period of 12 weeks to determine the efficacy of FS (500 mg/day/subject) on free and total testosterone levels, sperm profile, sperm morphology, libido and sexual health, mood and mental alertness, and broad spectrum safety parameters. Results: Free testosterone levels were improved up to 46% in 90% of the study population. 85.4% of the study population showed improvements in sperm counts. Sperm morphology improved in 14.6% of volunteers. Majority of the subjects enrolled in the study demonstrated improvements in mental alertness and mood. Furthermore, cardiovascular health and libido were significantly improved. Extensive safety parameters were evaluated which included blood chemistry data. No significant changes were observed in serum lipid function, cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL and LDL levels, hemogram (CBC), hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Conclusion: Overall, the results demonstrate that FS, enriched in 20% protodioscin, is safe and effective in attenuating testosterone levels, healthy sperm profile, mental alertness, cardiovascular health and overall performance in human subjects."

      Chios Mastiha essential oil (CMO) is a natural product extracted from the resin of Mastiha, possessing antioxidant, anti-microbial, anti-ulcer, anti-neoplastic, and cholesterol-lowering capabilities in vitro, and its hypolipidemic effect was confirmed in animal studies. Yet, there are no randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies in the literature regarding CMO's hypolipidemic effects in humans. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to study the hypolipidemic effect of CMO capsules on healthy volunteers with elevated cholesterol.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      192 healthy volunteers were screened and 160 of them with total cholesterol> 200 mg/dl participated in the study. They were randomized with a 2:1 ratio of receiving CMO capsules (200 mg mastiha-oil/capsule) and placebo for 8 weeks respectively. 113 patients received CMO and 47 were randomized in the control group, and all of them completed the follow-up period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After 8 weeks of CMO administration, total and LDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the CMO compared to the placebo group 215.2 ± 27.5 vs 237.0 ± 27.9 mg/dl (p < 0.001) and 135.0 ± 26.1 vs 153.0 ± 23.3 mg/dl (p < 0.001) respectively. No gastrointestinal adverse events or liver or renal toxicity were reported. Additionally, in the CMO group total cholesterol was significantly decreased by 20.6 mg/dl (9%), LDL by 18.1 mg/dl (12%), triglycerides by 21.8 mg/dl (15%), and glucose by 4.6 mg/dl (5%) and HDL was increased by 2.4 mg/dl (5%), compared to their baseline values.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The MASTIHA-OIL study showed the efficacy and safety of CMO in reduction of total and LDL cholesterol after 8 weeks of administration in healthy volunteers with elevated cholesterol levels."

Remdesivir has shown in vitro activity against coronaviruses and is a possible antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This prospective (compassionate), open-label study of remdesivir, which was conducted at Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy, between February 23 and March 20, 2020, involved patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia aged ≥18 years undergoing mechanical ventilation or with an oxygen saturation level of ≤94 % in air or a National Early Warning Score 2 of ≥4. The primary outcome was the change in clinical status based on a 7-category ordinal scale (1 = not hospitalised, resuming normal daily activities; 7 = deceased). The 35 patients enrolled from February 23 to March 20, 2020, included 18 in intensive care unit (ICU), and 17 in our infectious diseases ward (IDW). The 10-day course of remdesivir was completed by 22 patients (63 %) and discontinued by 13, of whom eight (22.8 %) discontinued because of adverse events. The median follow-up was 39 days (IQR 25-44). At day 28, 14 (82.3 %) patients from IDW were discharged, two were still hospitalized and one died (5.9 %), whereas in ICU 6 (33.3 %) were discharged, 8 (44.4 %) patients died, three (16.7 %) were still mechanically ventilated and one (5.6 %) was improved but still hospitalized. Hypertransaminasemia and acute kidney injury were the most frequent severe adverse events observed (42.8 % and 22.8 % of the cases, respectively). Our data suggest that remdesivir can benefit patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia hospitalised outside ICU where clinical outcome was better and adverse events are less frequently observed. Ongoing randomised controlled trials will clarify its real efficacy and safety, who to treat, and when."
Effectiveness of blood pressure-lowering treatment by the levels of baseline Framingham risk score: A post hoc analysis of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).,"Ling Zhang, Xiuting Sun, Lizhen Liao, Shaozhao Zhang, Huimin Zhou, Xiangbin Zhong, Xiaodong Zhuang, Xinxue Liao, Ling Zhanget al.",2019 Dec,J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31670874/,"Framingham risk score, Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), cardiovascular disease, intensive blood pressure treatment.","This was a post hoc analysis of Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), aimed to investigate whether intensive blood pressure treatment has differential therapeutic outcomes on patients with different baseline Framingham risk score (FRS). The 9298 SPRINT participants were categorized into low-risk (baseline FRS < 10%), intermediate-risk (FRS = 10%-20%), or high-risk (FRS > 20%) arms. The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in myocardial infarction, stroke, acute decompensated heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. Serious adverse events were defined as hypotension, syncope, and bradycardia. Multiple Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios for study outcomes with intensive compared with standard SBP treatment between these three groups. After a median follow-up time of 3.26 years, the primary outcome hazard ratio (HR) for intensive versus standard treatment was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.61-0.88, P = .0044) in the high-risk arm. And, for all-cause mortality, the hazard ratio with intensive SBP treatment was 1.58 (95% CI: 0.55-1.06), 0.9 (95% CI: 0.26-9.50), and 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34-0.82) in three arms (all P values for interaction > 0.05). Effects of intensive versus standard SBP control on serious adverse events were similar among patients with different FRS. Our results suggested that regardless of the FRS level, the intensive blood pressure control was beneficial."

      Immunotherapy targeting the PD-1 axis has activity in several tumour types. We aimed to establish the activity and safety of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with untreated brain metastases from melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this non-randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with melanoma or NSCLC with untreated brain metastases from the Yale Cancer Center. Patients had at least one untreated or progressive brain metastasis between 5 and 20 mm in diameter without associated neurological symptoms or the need for corticosteroids. Patients with NSCLC had tumour tissue positive for PD-L1 expression; this was not required for patients with melanoma. Patients were given 10 mg/kg pembrolizumab every 2 weeks until progression. The primary endpoint was brain metastasis response assessed in all treated patients. The trial is ongoing and here we present an early analysis. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02085070.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between March 31, 2014, and May 31, 2015, we screened 52 patients with untreated or progressive brain metastases (18 with melanoma, 34 with NSCLC), and enrolled 36 (18 with melanoma, 18 with NSCLC). A brain metastasis response was achieved in four (22%; 95% CI 7-48) of 18 patients with melanoma and six (33%; 14-59) of 18 patients with NSCLC. Responses were durable, with all but one patient with NSCLC who responded showing an ongoing response at the time of data analysis on June 30, 2015. Treatment-related serious and grade 3-4 adverse events were grade 3 elevated aminotransferases (n=1 [6%]) in the melanoma cohort, and grade 3 colitis (n=1 [6%]), grade 3 pneumonitis (n=1 [6%]), grade 3 fatigue (n=1 [6%]), grade 4 hyperkalemia (n=1 [6%]), and grade 2 acute kidney injury (n=1 [6%]) in the NSCLC cohort. Clinically significant neurological adverse events included transient grade 3 cognitive dysfunction and grade 1-2 seizures (n=3 [17%]) in the melanoma cohort.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Pembrolizumab shows activity in brain metastases in patients with melanoma or NSCLC with an acceptable safety profile, which suggests that there might be a role for systemic immunotherapy in patients with untreated or progressive brain metastases.

      The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of nasal oxygen as a supplementation to hydration therapy in reducing the risk of developing contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      In a randomized controlled trial, 348 patients scheduled to undergo elective coronary angiography were randomly allocated to standard hydration plus 2 L/min to 3 L/min nasal oxygen (from 10 minutes before the procedure until the end of the procedure) (n = 176) or standard hydration alone (n = 176). The primary outcome measure was development of CIN defined as either an increase of 25% or more in serum creatinine concentrations or an increment of at least 0.5 mg/dL in serum creatinine concentrations 48 hours after catheterization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 348 patients who completed the study, 105 developed CIN (30.2%; 95% confidence interval, 25.4% to 35.0%). A diagnosis of CIN was made in 32 (18.6%) and 73 (41.5%) patients in the nasal oxygen and control arms, respectively (P < .001). In the intervention arm, creatinine concentrations postcontrast remained relatively constant (average change, 2.7%), whereas a significant increase of 17.3% was recorded in the control arm (P < .001; effect size, 11.8%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Supplementation with nasal oxygen in addition to standard hydration appears to be an effective strategy in reducing CIN. The effect size for this intervention seems to be moderate."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical complication among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing invasive management. The value of adjunctive antithrombotic strategies, such as bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin (UFH) on the risk of AKI is unclear.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Among 7213 patients enrolled in the MATRIX-Antithrombin and Treatment Duration study, 128 subjects were excluded due to incomplete information on serum creatinine (sCr) or end-stage renal disease on dialysis treatment. The primary endpoint was AKI defined as an absolute (>0.5 mg/dL) or a relative (>25%) increase in sCr. AKI occurred in 601 patients (16.9%) treated with bivalirudin and 616 patients (17.4%) treated with UFH [odds ratio (OR): 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85-1.09; P = 0.58]. A >25% sCr increase was observed in 597 patients (16.8%) with bivalirudin and 616 patients (17.4%) with UFH (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.85-1.08; P = 0.50), whereas a >0.5 mg/dL absolute sCr increase occurred in 176 patients (5.0%) with bivalirudin vs. 189 patients (5.4%) with UFH (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.75-1.14; P = 0.46). By implementing the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, the risk of AKI was not significantly different between bivalirudin and UFH groups (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.72-1.07; P = 0.21). Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint suggested a benefit with bivalirudin in patients randomized to femoral access.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Among ACS patients undergoing invasive management, the risk of AKI was not significantly lower with bivalirudin compared with UFH.

Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation improves early-stage diabetic nephropathy and subclinical atherosclerosis in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes: A randomized controlled trial.,"Nancy Samir Elbarbary, Eman Abdel Rahman Ismail, Sarah Abdelaal Mohamed, Nancy Samir Elbarbaryet al.",2023 Dec,Clin Nutr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37862823/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Numerous studies have evaluated the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids on inflammatory, autoimmune and renal diseases. However, data about the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on diabetic kidney disease in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are lacking.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This randomized-controlled trial assessed the effect of oral omega-3 supplementation on glycemic control, lipid profile, albuminuria level, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) in pediatric patients with T1DM and diabetic nephropathy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seventy T1DM patients and diabetic nephropathy were enrolled with a mean age 15.2 ± 1.96 years and median disease duration 7 years. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups; intervention group which received oral omega-3 fatty acids capsules (1 g daily). The other group received a matching placebo and served as a control group. Both groups were followed-up for 6 months with assessment of fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, fasting lipids, urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR), KIM-1 and CIMT.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After 6 months, omega-3 fatty acids adjuvant therapy for the intervention group resulted in a significant decrease in FBG, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, UACR, KIM-1 and CIMT, whereas, HDL-cholesterol was significantly higher post-therapy compared with baseline levels and compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Baseline KIM-1 levels were positively correlated to HbA1c, UACR and CIMT. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids was safe and well-tolerated.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Omega-3 fatty acids as an adjuvant therapy in pediatric T1DM patients with diabetic nephropathy improved glycemic control, dyslipidemia and delayed disease progression and subclinical atherosclerosis among those patients.

      We aimed to assess the effects of remote ischemic pre-conditioning (RIPC) on the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after an intravenous (IV) or intra-arterial injection of contrast medium (CM) in patient and control groups.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial included 26 patients who were hospitalized for the evaluation of the feasibility of transcatheter aortic valve implantation and underwent investigations including contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), with Mehran risk scores greater than or equal to six. All the patients underwent four cycles of five minute-blood pressure cuff inflation followed by five minutes of total deflation. In the RIPC group (n = 13), the cuff was inflated to 50 mm Hg above the patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP); in the control group (n = 13), it was inflated to 10 mm Hg below the patient's SBP. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of CIN. Additionally, variation in the serum levels of cystatin C was assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One case of CIN was observed in the control group, whereas no cases were detected in the RIPC group (p = 0.48, analysis of 25 patients). Mean creatinine values at the baseline, 24 hours after injection of CM, and 48 hours after injection of CM were 88 ± 32 μmol/L, 91 ± 28 μmol/L and 82 ± 29 μmol/L, respectively (p = 0.73) in the RIPC group, whereas in the control group, they were 100 ± 36 μmol/L, 110 ± 36 μmol/L, and 105 ± 34 μmol/L, respectively (p = 0.78). Cystatin C values (median [Q1, Q3]) at the baseline, 24 hours after injection of CM, and 48 hours after injection of CM were 1.10 [1.08, 1.18] mg/L, 1.17 [0.97, 1.35] mg/L, and 1.12 [0.99, 1.24] mg/L, respectively (p = 0.88) in the RIPC group, whereas they were 1.11 [0.97, 1.28] mg/L, 1.13 [1.08, 1.25] mg/L, and 1.16 [1.03, 1.31] mg/L, respectively (p = 0.93), in the control group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The risk of CIN after an IV injection of CM is very low in patients with Mehran risk score greater than or equal to six and even in the patients who are unable to receive preventive hyperhydration. Hence, the Mehran risk score may not be an appropriate method for the estimation of the risk of CIN after IV CM injection."

      Aponermin, a circularly permuted tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, is a potential death receptor 4/5-targeted antitumour candidate. Previous phase 1/2 studies have demonstrated the efficacy of aponermin in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). To confirm the superiority of aponermin plus thalidomide and dexamethasone (aponermin group) over placebo plus thalidomide and dexamethasone (placebo group) in RRMM, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled phase 3 trial was performed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Four hundred seventeen patients with RRMM who had previously received at least two regimens were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive aponermin, thalidomide, and dexamethasone or placebo, thalidomide, and dexamethasone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 415 patients received at least one dose of trial treatment (276 vs. 139). The median PFS was 5.5 months in the aponermin group and 3.1 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.78; P < 0.001). The median OS was 22.4 months for the aponermin group and 16.4 months for the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89; P = 0.003). Significantly higher rates of ORR (30.4% vs. 13.7%, P < 0.001) and very good partial response or better (14.1% vs. 2.2%, P < 0.0001) were achieved in the aponermin group than in the placebo group. Treatment with aponermin caused hepatotoxicity in some patients, as indicated by the elevated alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, or lactate dehydrogenase levels (52.2% vs. 24.5%, 51.1% vs. 19.4% and 44.9% vs. 21.6%, respectively), mostly grade 1/2, transient and reversible. The main grade 3/4 adverse events included neutropenia, pneumonia and hyperglycemia. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the two groups (40.6% vs. 37.4%). There was no evidence that aponermin leads to hematological toxicity, nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, or secondary tumors.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Aponermin plus thalidomide and dexamethasone significantly improved PFS, OS and ORR with manageable side effects in RRMM patients who had received at least two prior therapies. These results support the use of aponermin, thalidomide, and dexamethasone as a treatment option for RRMM patients.

Here, the aim was to analyze the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin stratified according to baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial randomly assigned patients with T2DM and either previous atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors to dapagliflozin or placebo. Patients were categorized by baseline SBP levels: <120, 120 to 129, 130 to 139, 140 to 159, and ≥160 mm Hg (normal, elevated, stage 1, stage 2, and severe hypertension, respectively). Efficacy outcomes of interest were hospitalization for heart failure and a renal-specific composite outcome (sustained decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate by 40%, progression to end-stage renal disease, or renal death). Safety outcomes included symptoms of volume depletion, lower extremity amputations, and acute kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial comprised 17 160 patients; mean age, 64.0±6.8 years; 37.4% women; median duration of T2DM, 11 years; 40.6% with prevalent cardiovascular disease. Overall, dapagliflozin reduced SBP by 2.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.9-2.9; P<0.0001) compared with placebo at 48 months. The beneficial effects of dapagliflozin on hospitalization for heart failure and renal outcomes were consistent across all baseline SBP categories, with no evidence of modification of treatment effect (Pinteractions=0.28 and 0.52, respectively). Among normotensive patients, the hazard ratios were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.42-1.05) and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.19-0.78), respectively, for hospitalization for heart failure and the renal-specific outcome. Events of volume depletion, amputation, and acute kidney injury did not differ with dapagliflozin overall or within any baseline SBP group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with T2DM with or at high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, dapagliflozin reduced risk for hospitalization for heart failure and renal outcomes regardless of baseline SBP, with no difference in adverse events of interest at any level of baseline SBP. These results indicate that dapagliflozin provides cardiorenal benefits in patients with T2DM at high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk independent of baseline blood pressure.

A randomized trial of albumin infusion to prevent intradialytic hypotension in hospitalized hypoalbuminemic patients.,"Etienne Macedo, Bethany Karl, Euyhyun Lee, Ravindra L Mehta, Etienne Macedoet al.",2021 Jan 6,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33407747/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a frequent complication of intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), occurring from 15 to 50% of ambulatory sessions, and is more frequent among hospitalized patients with hypoalbuminemia. IDH limits adequate fluid removal and increases the risk for vascular access thrombosis, early hemodialysis (HD) termination, and mortality. Albumin infusion before and during therapy has been used for treating IDH with the varying results. We evaluated the efficacy of albumin infusion in preventing IDH during IHD in hypoalbuminemic inpatients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A randomized, crossover trial was performed in 65 AKI or ESKD patients with hypoalbuminemia (albumin < 3 g/dl) who required HD during hospitalization. Patients were randomized to receive 100 ml of either 0.9%sodium chloride or 25% albumin intravenously at the initiation of each dialysis. These two solutions were alternated for up to six sessions. Patients' vital signs and ultrafiltration removal rate were recorded every 15 to 30 min during dialysis. IDH was assessed by different definitions reported in the literature. All symptoms associated with a noted hypotensive event as well as interventions during the dialysis were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-five patients were submitted to 249 sessions; the mean age was 58 ([Formula: see text] 12), and 46 (70%) were male with a mean weight of 76 ([Formula: see text] 18) kg. The presence of IDH was lower during albumin sessions based on all definitions. The hypotension risk was significantly decreased based on the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative definition; (15% with NS vs. 7% with albumin, p = 0.002). The lowest intradialytic SBP was significantly worse in patients who received 0.9% sodium chloride than albumin (NS 83 vs. albumin 90 mmHg, p = 0.035). Overall ultrafiltration rate was significantly higher in the albumin therapies [NS - 8.25 ml/kg/h (- 11.18 5.80) vs. 8.27 ml/kg/h (- 12.22 to 5.53) with albumin, p = 0.011].
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In hypoalbuminemic patients who need HD, albumin administration before the dialysis results in fewer episodes of hypotension and improves fluid removal. Albumin infusion may be of benefit to improve the safety of HD and achievement of fluid balance in these high-risk patients. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04522635."
"Long-term safety of long-acting octreotide in patients with diabetic retinopathy: results of pooled data from 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies.","Rosario Pivonello, Giovanna Muscogiuri, Geoffrey Holder, Michaela Paul, Severine Sarp, Anastasia Lesogor, Pierre Jordaan, Johannes Eisinger, Annamaria Colao, Rosario Pivonelloet al.",2018 Apr,Endocrine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29116540/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Octreotide (OCT) has been successfully used for treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors for more than 30 years. However, long-term safety of OCT has not been documented in placebo-controlled setting. This present analysis pooled safety data from two similarly-designed, randomized, and placebo-controlled studies to evaluate long-term safety of long-acting OCT (20, 30 mg); targeted post-hoc analyzes focused on cardiac, hepatic, and renal safety.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two studies (NCT00131144, NCT001308450) were conducted in patients with diabetic retinopathy (OCT20 = 191, OCT30 = 348, placebo = 347). In this analysis, patients were stratified based on baseline glomerular filtration rate. Hepatic, cardiac, and renal adverse events (AEs) were identified by standardized MedDRA queries.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median duration of exposure was >3.5 years. Most common AEs reported with OCT were diarrhea, cholelithiasis, hypoglycemia, nasopharyngitis, and hypertension. Incidence of cardiac events (QT prolongation and arrhythmia) with OCT20 and OCT30 were comparable to placebo (OCT20, RR = 1.11 [95% CI, 0.61-2.03]; OCT30, RR = 1.09 [95% CI, 0.70-1.68]). For ECG findings, changes in QTcF were similar in treatment groups, and outliers did not exceed 480 ms. Incidence of cardiac ischemia was lower with OCT than placebo (OCT20 = 12.6%, OCT30 = 10.6%, placebo = 15.3%). Incidence of liver-related AEs was higher with OCT30 than placebo (RR = 2.04 [95% CI, 1.28-3.26]); incidences were comparable with OCT20 and placebo (RR = 1.50 [95% CI, 0.69-3.25]). Overall incidences of renal AEs were comparable between treatment groups (OCT20 = 5.8%; OCT30 = 6.3%; placebo = 7.2%). Drug-related SAEs were reported more frequently with OCT (OCT20 = 7.9%; OCT30 = 10.1%; placebo = 3.5%); predominantly gallbladder-related, GI-related, and hypoglycemia.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results from these long-term placebo-controlled studies confirm the established safety profile of long-acting OCT, in particular low risk of cardiac, hepatic and renal toxicity in a high-risk population."

      To investigate the effect of hyperglycemia and empagliflozin on cardiorenal injury and inflammation in patients with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes (T1D).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Serum cardiac (sST2, Gal-3, cTnT), kidney injury (KIM-1, NGAL), inflammatory (sTNFR1, sTNFR2), and hemodynamic (NT-proBNP, EPO) markers were assessed post-hoc in two separate T1D cohorts. The glycemic clamp trial (NCT02344602) evaluated 49 adults with T1D and 27 controls under euglycemic and acute hyperglycemic conditions. The crossover BETWEEN trial (NCT02632747) investigated empagliflozin 25 mg plus ramipril for 4 weeks compared to placebo-ramipril for 4 weeks in 30 adults with T1D.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the glycemic clamp study, hyperglycemia acutely increased levels of NT-proBNP (p = 0.0003) and sTNFR2 (p = 0.003). BETWEEN participants treated with empagliflozin exhibited a paradoxical subacute rise in NT-proBNP (p = 0.0147) compared to placebo, independent of hematocrit. Individuals with higher baseline levels of sST2 and sTNFR1 had greater empagliflozin-associated reductions in systolic blood pressure and greater activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) mediators, whereas those with higher baseline levels of KIM-1 and sTNFR1 had greater glomerular filtration rate (GFR) dip.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The protective mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibition on blood pressure, RAAS activation, and renal hemodynamics are apparent in the subset of people with uncomplicated T1D with adverse cardiorenal and inflammatory markers."
Derivation and Validation of a Major Toxicity Risk Score Among Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug Users Based on Data From a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Daniel H Solomon, Ming Shao, Kathy Wolski, Steven Nissen, M Elaine Husni, Nina Paynter, Daniel H Solomonet al.",2019 Aug,Arthritis Rheumatol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30801994/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      While nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used in rheumatology, they can cause major toxicity. Improving the risk/benefit ratio requires a more precise understanding of risk. This study was undertaken to derive and validate a risk score for major toxicity among NSAID users enrolled in a randomized controlled trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial who had known cardiovascular disease or risk factors as well as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis were divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Patients were randomized to receive celecoxib, naproxen, or ibuprofen at typical dosages. The risk score was designed to predict the 1-year occurrence of major toxicity among NSAID users, including major adverse cardiovascular events, acute kidney injury, significant gastrointestinal events, and mortality. Variables significantly associated with major toxicity were candidates for inclusion in the final regression model. After derived models were found to have a similar model fit in the validation set, the cohorts were combined, allowing calculation of a risk score.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the derivation cohort, significant variables included age, male sex, history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, statin use, elevated serum creatinine level, hematocrit level, and type of arthritis. The C-index was 0.73 in the validation cohort and 0.71 in the total cohort; the model was well calibrated. Of the total population with complete data (n = 23,735), 1,080 participants (4.6%) had a predicted 1-year risk of major toxicity of <1%, 16,273 (68.6%) had a predicted risk of 1-4%, and 6,382 (26.9%) had a predicted risk of >4%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The risk score accurately categorizes the 1-year risk of major toxicity among NSAID users and may be useful in identifying patients who can safely use these agents."
Effect of Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Inhibition on Biomarkers of Kidney Injury and Vascular Calcification in Diabetic Kidney Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Thananda Trakarnvanich, Bancha Satirapoj, Swangjit Suraamornkul, Thanit Chirananthavat, Anoma Sanpatchayapong, Torpong Claimon, Thananda Trakarnvanichet al.",2021 Oct 16:2021:7382620.,J Diabetes Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34697593/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors improve glycemic control and have pleiotropic effects on kidney injury, albuminuria, and vascular inflammation, especially in animal models. We evaluated the effects of a potent DPP4 inhibitor (gemigliptin) on these processes among patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study employed a multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled design. A total of 201 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups, one received treatment with 50 mg gemigliptin daily along with standard care for diabetes mellitus for 6 months. The changes in the coronary calcium score (CAC score), cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), vascular calcification level, and tubular renal injury marker expression were evaluated at baseline and 6 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 182 patients completed the study. Significant reductions in hemoglobin A1C levels were observed in both groups. The changes in the CAC score, CAVI, eGFR, and level of proteinuria over the 6 months of the study did not significantly differ between the gemigliptin and control groups. However, biomarkers of vascular calcification, including serum bone alkaline phosphatase and kidney injury, including urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)/Cr and urine liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP)/Cr, were improved significantly in the gemigliptin treatment group compared with the control group. No serious adverse events were observed during the study.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our study showed that gemigliptin significantly improved the expression of renal tubular injury biomarkers and vascular calcification levels among patients with DKD; however, gemigliptin did not affect renal function or coronary calcification compared with those observed in the control. A larger study with a longer follow-up is essential to verify these beneficial effects. Clinical Trials. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.Gov Identifier NCT04705506."

Primary outcome was a change of urinary TGF-beta1, albuminuria, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). All patients had stable metabolic profiles for at least 90 days before randomization. Results. Urinary TGF-beta1 increased significantly in the placebo group but did not change significantly in the sulodexide group. Additionally, the mean change of urine TGF-beta1 in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the sulodexide group (8.44 ± 9.21 versus 2.17 ± 6.96 pg/mg Cr, P = 0.02). Mean changes of urinary albumin were 15.05 ± 30.09 μg/mg Cr (P = 0.038) in the placebo group and 13.89 ± 32.25 μg/mg Cr (P = 0.069) in the sulodexide group. No consistent patterns of side effects were observed. Conclusion. In this 14-week trial, benefits of sulodexide in preventing the increase of urinary TGF-beta1 were observed in patients with normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetes. The study suggests that sulodexide treatment may provide additional renoprotection in early stage DN. This trial is registered with TCTR20140806001."

      Serum uric acid (sUA) control is of key relevance in tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) prevention as it correlates with both TLS and renal event risk. We sought to determine whether febuxostat fixed dose achieves a better sUA control than allopurinol while preserving renal function in TLS prevention.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Patients with hematologic malignancies at intermediate to high TLS risk grade were randomized to receive febuxostat or allopurinol, starting 2 days before induction chemotherapy, for 7-9 days. Study treatment was blinded, whereas daily dose (low/standard/high containing allopurinol 200/300/600 mg, respectively, or fixed febuxostat 120 mg) depended on the investigator's choice. The co-primary end points, sUA area under curve (AUC sUA1-8) and serum creatinine change, were assessed from baseline to day 8 and analyzed through analysis of covariance with two-sided overall significance level of 5%. Secondary end points included treatment responder rate, laboratory and clinical TLS incidence and safety.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 346 patients (82.1% intermediate TLS risk; 82.7% assigned to standard dose) were randomized. Mean AUC sUA1-8 was 514.0 ± 225.71 versus 708.0 ± 234.42 mgxh/dl (P < 0.0001) in favor of febuxostat. Mean serum creatinine change was -0.83 ± 26.98% and -4.92 ± 16.70% for febuxostat and allopurinol, respectively (P = 0.0903). No differences among secondary efficacy end points were detected. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 6.4% of patients in both arms.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In the largest adult trial carried out in TLS prevention, febuxostat achieved a significant superior sUA control with one fixed dose in comparison to allopurinol with comparable renal function preservation and safety profile.

      The routine use of empiric combination therapy with aminoglycosides during critical illness is associated with uncertain benefit and increased risk of acute kidney injury. This study aimed to assess the benefits of aminoglycosides in immunocompromised patients with suspected bacterial pneumonia and sepsis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Secondary analysis of a prospective multicenter study. Adult immunocompromised patients with suspected bacterial pneumonia and sepsis or septic shock were included. Primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were needed for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Mortality was also assessed in neutropenic patients and in those with confirmed bacterial pneumonia. Results were further analyzed in a cohort matched on risk of receiving aminoglycosides combination.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Five hundred thirty-five patients were included in this analysis, of whom 187 (35%) received aminoglycosides in addition to another antibiotic effective against gram-negative bacteria. Overall hospital mortality was 59.6% (58.3% vs. 60.3% in patients receiving and not receiving combination therapy; P = 0.71). Lack of association between mortality and aminoglycosides was confirmed after adjustment for confounders and center effect (adjusted OR 1.14 [0.69-1.89]) and in a propensity matched cohort (adjusted OR = 0.89 [0.49-1.61]). No association was found between aminoglycosides and need for RRT (adjusted OR = 0.83 [0.49-1.39], P = 0.477), nor between aminoglycoside use and outcome in neutropenic patients or in patients with confirmed bacterial pneumonia (adjusted OR 0.66 [0.23-1.85] and 1.25 [0.61-2.57], respectively).

Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a widely investigated novel biomarker for early diagnosis of AKI. However, no study assessed NGAL for AKI diagnosis in HSCT patients. We performed further analyses on gathered data from our recent trial to evaluate the performance of urine NGAL (uNGAL) as an indicator of AKI in 72 allogeneic HSCT patients. AKI diagnosis and severity were assessed using Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End-stage renal disease and AKI Network criteria. We assessed uNGAL on days -6, -3, +3, +9 and +15. Time-dependent Cox regression analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between uNGAL and AKI occurrence. (HR = 1.04 (1.008-1.07), p = 0.01). There was a relation between uNGAL day + 9 to baseline ratio and incidence of AKI (unadjusted HR = 1.047 (1.012-1.083), p < 0.01). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for day + 9 to baseline ratio was 0.86 (0.74-0.99, p < 0.01) and a cut-off value of 2.62 was 85% sensitive and 83% specific in predicting AKI. Our results indicated that increase in uNGAL augmented the risk of AKI and the changes of day +9 uNGAL concentrations from baseline could be of value for predicting AKI in HSCT patients. Additionally uNGAL changes preceded serum Cr raises by nearly 2 days."
Prevention of cardiac surgery-associated AKI by implementing the KDIGO guidelines in high risk patients identified by biomarkers: the PrevAKI randomized controlled trial.,"Melanie Meersch, Christoph Schmidt, Andreas Hoffmeier, Hugo Van Aken, Carola Wempe, Joachim Gerss, Alexander Zarbock, Melanie Meerschet al.",2017 Nov,Intensive Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28110412/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Care bundles are recommended in patients at high risk for acute kidney injury (AKI), although they have not been proven to improve outcomes. We sought to establish the efficacy of an implementation of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines to prevent cardiac surgery-associated AKI in high risk patients defined by renal biomarkers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this single-center trial, we examined the effect of a ""KDIGO bundle"" consisting of optimization of volume status and hemodynamics, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, and preventing hyperglycemia in high risk patients defined as urinary [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] > 0.3 undergoing cardiac surgery. The primary endpoint was the rate of AKI defined by KDIGO criteria within the first 72 h after surgery. Secondary endpoints included AKI severity, need for dialysis, length of stay, and major adverse kidney events (MAKE) at days 30, 60, and 90.
    


          Results:
        
      
      AKI was significantly reduced with the intervention compared to controls [55.1 vs. 71.7%; ARR 16.6% (95 CI 5.5-27.9%); p = 0.004]. The implementation of the bundle resulted in significantly improved hemodynamic parameters at different time points (p < 0.05), less hyperglycemia (p < 0.001) and use of ACEi/ARBs (p < 0.001) compared to controls. Rates of moderate to severe AKI were also significantly reduced by the intervention compared to controls. There were no significant effects on other secondary outcomes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      An implementation of the KDIGO guidelines compared with standard care reduced the frequency and severity of AKI after cardiac surgery in high risk patients. Adequately powered multicenter trials are warranted to examine mortality and long-term renal outcomes."

      HS-10234 is a novel prodrug of tenofovir developed to increase anti-viral potency and to reduce systemic toxicities.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-viral efficacy of HS-10234 in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection METHODS: Treatment-naïve subjects with non-cirrhotic CHB were divided into three groups (n = 12/group) and randomised within each group to receive 10, 25 or 40 mg of HS-10234, or 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) once a day for 28 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 36 enrolled subjects, 33.3% were hepatitis B e antigen-negative with a mean hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level of 6.32-7.42 log10 IU/mL. Nephrotoxicity and serious adverse events were not observed; all adverse events were mild or moderate and non-specific. The mean reductions in serum HBV DNA after 28 days were -2.70, -2.89, -2.72 and -3.04 log10 IU/mL for treatment with 10, 25 or 40 mg HS-10234, and 300 mg TDF, respectively. HS-10234 and its metabolite TFV showed linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. The concentrations of active TFV-DP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were higher (approximately 2- to 11-fold increase) and TFV in plasma were lower (approximately 4.5- to 25-fold reduction) in subjects taking HS-10234 than those in the TDF group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      HS-10234 was well tolerated during a 4-week course. TDF and HS-10234 had comparable potency in inhibiting HBV replication. A daily dose of 10-25 mg of HS-10234 is recommended for CHB treatment. (Chinese Drug Trial Identifier: CTR20161077)."

      To compare the effect of mannitol plus hypertonic saline combination (MHS) versus hypertonic saline monotherapy (HS) on renal function in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This was a secondary analysis of data from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Hypertonic Saline Trial Shock Study and Traumatic Brain Injury Study. The study cohort included a propensity matched subset of patients with TBI who received MHS or HS. The primary outcome measure was the maximum serum creatinine value during critical illness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The cohort consisted of 163 patients in the MHS group and 163 patients in the HS group (n = 326). The maximum serum creatinine value during hospitalization was 82 ± 47 μmol/L (0.86 ± 0.26 mg/dL) in the MHS group and 76 ± 23 μmol/L (0.92 ± 0.53 mg/dL) in the HS group (difference -6 μmol/L, 95% CI -14 to 2 μmol/L, p = .151). The lowest eGFR during hospitalization was 108 ± 25 mL/min in the MHS group and 112 ± 24 mL/min in the HS group (difference -4 mL/min, 95% CI -1 to 9 mLmin, p = .150).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The addition of mannitol to HS did not increase the risk of renal dysfunction compared to HS alone in patients with TBI."

      To characterize hemodynamic alterations occurring during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in a large cohort of children and to identify clinical and biochemical factors associated with hypertension.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      This was a planned secondary analysis of data from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Fluid Therapies Under Investigation in DKA Study, a randomized clinical trial of fluid resuscitation protocols for children in DKA. Hemodynamic data (heart rate, blood pressure) from children with DKA were assessed in comparison with normal values for age and sex. Multivariable statistical modeling was used to explore clinical and laboratory predictors of hypertension.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 1258 DKA episodes, hypertension was documented at presentation in 154 (12.2%) and developed during DKA treatment in an additional 196 (15.6%), resulting in a total of 350 DKA episodes (27.8%) in which hypertension occurred at some time. Factors associated with hypertension at presentation included more severe acidosis, (lower pH and lower pCO2), and stage 2 or 3 acute kidney injury. More severe acidosis and lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores were associated with hypertension occurring at any time during DKA treatment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite dehydration, hypertension occurs in a substantial number of children with DKA. Factors associated with hypertension include greater severity of acidosis, lower pCO2, and lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores during DKA treatment, suggesting that hypertension might be centrally mediated."
Risk factors for kidney disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk: An exploratory analysis (DEVOTE 12).,"Aslam Amod, John B Buse, Darren K McGuire, Thomas R Pieber, Rodica Pop-Busui, Richard E Pratley, Bernard Zinman, Marco Bo Hansen, Ting Jia, Thomas Mark, Neil R Poulter                              ;, DEVOTE Study Group, Aslam Amodet al.",2020 Nov-Dec,Diab Vasc Dis Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33280425/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      To investigate risk factors associated with kidney disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high cardiovascular (CV) risk.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In DEVOTE, a cardiovascular outcomes trial, 7637 patients were randomised to insulin degludec (degludec) or insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100), with standard of care. In these exploratory post hoc analyses, serious adverse event reports were searched using Standardised MedDRA® Queries related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI). Baseline predictors of CKD, AKI and change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were identified using stepwise selection and Cox or linear regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Over 2 years, eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) decline was small and similar between treatments (degludec: 2.70; glargine U100: 2.92). Overall, 97 and 208 patients experienced CKD and AKI events, respectively. A history of heart failure was a risk factor for CKD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.97 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41; 2.75]) and AKI (HR 2.28 [95% CI 1.64; 3.17]). A history of hepatic impairment was a significant predictor of CKD (HR 3.28 [95% CI 2.12; 5.07]) and change in eGFR (estimate: -8.59 [95% CI -10.20; -7.00]).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our findings indicate that traditional, non-modifiable risk factors for kidney disorders apply to insulin-treated patients with T2D at high CV risk.

      To evaluate the effect of melatonin versus placebo on the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients treated with polymyxin B.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a single-centre, double-blind, randomized clinical trial (NCT03725267) of 30-mg oral melatonin versus placebo for patients treated with intravenous polymyxin B. Patients aged ≥18 years receiving polymyxin B for ≤48 hours were eligible. Melatonin or placebo pills were administered until the end of polymyxin B treatment or for a maximum of 14 days. The main outcome was any level of AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eighty-eight patients were randomized: 44 in the melatonin group and 44 in the placebo group. The study ended prematurely because of polymyxin B shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic. The patients' mean age was 63.6 ± 17.3 years, and 60.2% of the patients were men. Forty-six (52.3%, 23 in each group) patients developed AKI during the follow-up period. The incidence rate of AKI was 81.9/1000 and 77.4/1000 patients per day in melatonin and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.61-1.94; p 0.78). Renal failure and 30-day mortality were similar between the groups. Moreover, the incidence of AKI was not different in pre-specified sub-groups.

Efficacy and safety of a low-sodium diet and spironolactone in patients with stage 1-3a chronic kidney disease: a pilot study.,"Hongmei Zhang, Bin Zhu, Liyang Chang, Xingxing Ye, Rongrong Tian, Luchen He, Dongrong Yu, Hongyu Chen, Yongjun Wang, Hongmei Zhanget al.",2022 Mar 5,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35247964/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Excessive salt intake is associated with the deterioration of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Aldosterone is also known as an independent risk factor for kidney injury. Dietary sodium intake acts as a main stimulator in aldosterone-mediated kidney injury. Hence, this study aimed to further investigate the renal protective effects and safety of a low-sodium diet in combination with spironolactone (SPL) in stage 1-3a CKD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This single-center, SPL-blinded randomized controlled trial recruited patients with stage 1-3a CKD, randomized into three groups, low-sodium (3 g/d salt) + placebo, medium-sodium (5 g/d salt) + SPL, and low-sodium (3 g/d salt) + SPL. Patients received 12 weeks of intervention. The primary and secondary endpoints were 24-h urine protein and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the end of the intervention, respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 74 patients were analyzed eventually. Significantly decreased 24-h urine protein was found in all three groups, from 0.37 to 0.23 g/d (P = 0.004) in the low-sodium+placebo group, from 0.44 to 0.29 g/d (P = 0.020) in the medium-sodium+SPL group, and from 0.35 to 0.31 g/d (P = 0.013) in the low-sodium +SPL group. There were no significant differences among the three groups in 24-h urine protein amount change after intervention from pre-treatment values (P = 0.760, ITT set). The results of the 24-h urine protein by using PP set analysis was similar to the ITT set. No significant differences in eGFR, nutritional, metabolic, inflammatory, and other biomarkers were observed across all three groups (P > 0.05). No safety signal was observed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      No additional benefit was observed when SPL was prescribed to patients already on a low-sodium diet (3.0 g/d). Still, small doses of SPL may benefit patients with poor sodium restriction. A combination of short-term low-dose SPL and ARB is safe for patients with stage 1-3a CKD, but blood potassium must be regularly monitored.

      Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) refers to impaired cardiac diastolic relaxation and may be improved by targeted heart rate reduction (THR). The authors evaluated whether a combination of carvedilol and ivabradine, an If channel blocker that reduces heart rate without affecting blood pressure, could improve LVDD and outcomes in cirrhosis.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      THR was defined as heart rate reduction to 55 to 65 beats per minute. Of 260 patients with cirrhosis, 189 (72%) with LVDD were randomized to THR [group (Gr.)A; n=94; carvedilol±ivabradine)] or standard care (Gr.B; n=95; no β-blockers) and followed for 12 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In Gr.A, THR was achieved at 4 weeks in 88 (93%) patients (responders, R): 48 (61.5%) with carvedilol alone and 40 (86.9%) of 46 patients with additional ivabradine. In Gr.A, LVDD reversed in 16 (20.5%) and improved from grade 2 to 1 in 34 (35.4%)], whereas in Gr.B, it progressed from grade 1 to 2 in 10 (10.5%) patients. At 12 months, 21 (11.1%) patients died, 6 (14%) in Gr.A and 15 (18%) in Gr.B (P=0.240), but no mortality was seen in those who had persistent THR at 1 year (n=78; P=0.000). In multivariate analysis, model for end-stage liver disease [hazard ratio (HR), 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-2.75; P=0.034] and E-wave transmitral/early diastolic mitral annular velocity (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.23-2.42; P=0.048) predicted 1-year mortality. Nonresponders had an increased mortality risk (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P=0.046) independent of age, gender, and baseline model for end-stage liver disease. Levels of norepinephrine, N terminal brain natriuretic peptide, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone were reduced (P<0.01) in responders. More patients in Gr.B developed acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.8-10.5; P=0.027) and encephalopathy (odds ratio, 6.6; 95% CI, 1.9-9.7; P=0.040).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Ivabradine combined with carvedilol improves LVDD, achieves THR more often and reduces risk of encephalopathy, acute kidney injury with improved survival in patients with cirrhosis."

      FDG-positive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have a poorer prognosis and exhibit shorter response duration to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). The aim of this prospective phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE associated with metronomic capecitabine as a radiosensitizer agent in patients with advanced progressive FDG-positive gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) NETs.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Patients with advanced somatostatin receptor- and FDG-positive G1-G3 GEP-NETs (Ki67 < 55%) were treated with a cumulative activity of 27.5 GBq of 177Lu-DOTATATE divided in five cycles of 5.5 GBq each every 8 weeks. Capecitabine (1000-1500 mg daily) was administered orally in the inter-cycle period between 177Lu-DOTATATE treatments. Prior to commencing capecitabine, all patients were triaged with the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) test. Only DPD-proficient individuals were enrolled. The primary objectives were disease control rate (DCR) and safety. Secondary aims included progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Treatment response was assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Toxicity was assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From August 2015 to December 2016, 37 subjects were consecutively enrolled. A total of 25 (68%) were affected by pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (P-NETs), and 12 (32%) had gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (GI-NETs). By grading (WHO 2010 classification), 12 patients (32%) had G1 (Ki67 ≤ 2%), 22 (59%) had G2 (3% < Ki67 ≤ 20%), and 3 patients (9%) had G3 (Ki67 > 20%) NETs. Grade 3 (G3) or 4 (G4) hematological toxicity occurred in 16.2% of patients. Other G3-G4 adverse events were diarrhea in 5.4% of cases and asthenia in 5.4%. No renal toxicity was observed for the duration of follow-up. In 37 patients, 33 were evaluable for response. Objective responses included partial response (PR) in 10 patients (30%) and stable disease (SD) in 18 patients (55%), with a DCR of 85%. The median follow-up was 38 months (range 4.6-51.1 months). The median PFS was 31.4 months (17.6-45.4), and mOS was not reached.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study demonstrated that the combination of PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE and metronomic capecitabine is active and well tolerated in patients with aggressive FDG-positive G1-G3 GEP-NETs. These data constitute the basis for a randomized study of PPRT alone vs. PRRT plus metronomic capecitabine."
Short-Term High-Dose Vitamin E to Prevent Contrast Medium-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Undergoing Elective Coronary Angiography: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.,"Yousef Rezaei, Kamal Khademvatani, Behzad Rahimi, Mehran Khoshfetrat, Nasim Arjmand, Mir-Hossein Seyyed-Mohammadzad, Yousef Rezaeiet al.",2016 Mar 15,J Am Heart Assoc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27068631/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Contrast medium-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) is a leading cause of acquired renal impairment. The effects of antioxidants have been conflicting regarding the prevention of CIAKI. We performed a study of vitamin E use to decrease CIAKI in patients undergoing elective coronary angiography.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      In a placebo-controlled randomized trial at 2 centers in Iran, 300 patients with chronic kidney disease-defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)-were randomized 1:1 to receive 0.9% saline infusion 12 hours prior to and after intervention combined with 600 mg vitamin E 12 hours before plus 400 mg vitamin E 2 hours before coronary angiography or to receive placebo. The primary end point was the development of CIAKI, defined as an increase ≥0.5 mg/dL or ≥25% in serum creatinine that peaked within 72 hours. Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, CIAKI developed in 10 (6.7%) and 21 (14.1%) patients in the vitamin E and placebo groups, respectively (P=0.037). Change in white blood cell count from baseline to peak value was greater in the vitamin E group compared with the placebo group (-500 [-1500 to 200] versus 100 [-900 to 600]×10(3)/mL, P=0.001). In multivariate analysis, vitamin E (odds ratio 0.408, 95% CI 0.170-0.982, P=0.045) and baseline Mehran score (odds ratio 1.257, 95% CI 1.007-1.569; P=0.043) predicted CIAKI.

"Intravenous sildenafil citrate and post-cardiac surgery acute kidney injury: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.","Tracy Kumar, Hardeep Aujla, Marcin Woźniak, Will Dott, Nikol Sullo, Lathishia Joel-David, Paolo Pais, Dawn Smallwood, Douglas Miller, Bryony Eagle-Hemming, Ana Suazo Di Paola, Shaun Barber, Cassandra Brookes, Nigel J Brunskill, Gavin J Murphy, Tracy Kumaret al.",2020 Jun,Br J Anaesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32245569/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      This study assessed whether i.v. sildenafil citrate prevented acute kidney injury in at-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a double-blind RCT, adults at increased risk of acute kidney injury undergoing cardiac surgery in a single UK tertiary centre were randomised to receive sildenafil citrate 12.5 mg kg-1 i.v. over 150 min or dextrose 5% at the commencement of surgery. The primary outcome was serum creatinine measured at six post-randomisation time points. The primary analysis used a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for the stratification variables, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, and surgical procedure. Secondary outcomes considered clinical events and potential disease mechanisms. Effect estimates were expressed as mean differences (MDs) or odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The analysis population comprised eligible randomised patients that underwent valve surgery or combined coronary artery bypass graft and valve surgery, with cardiopulmonary bypass, between May 2015 and June 2018. There were 60 subjects in the sildenafil group and 69 in the placebo control group. The difference between groups in creatinine concentration was not statistically significant (MD: 0.88 μmol L-1 [-5.82, 7.59]). There was a statistically significant increase in multiple organ dysfunction scores in the sildenafil group (MD: 0.54 [0.02, 1.07]; P=0.044). Secondary outcomes, and biomarkers of kidney injury, endothelial function, and inflammatory cell activation, were not significantly different between the groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results do not support the use of i.v. sildenafil citrate for kidney protection in adult cardiac surgery.

Endopeptidase Cleavage of Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Antibodies in vivo in Severe Kidney Disease: An Open-Label Phase 2a Study.,"Fredrik Uhlin, Wladimir Szpirt, Andreas Kronbichler, Annette Bruchfeld, Inga Soveri, Lionel Rostaing, Eric Daugas, Arnaud Lionet, Nassim Kamar, Cédric Rafat, Marek Mysliveček, Vladimír Tesař, Anders Fernström, Christian Kjellman, Charlotte Elfving, Stephen McAdoo, Johan Mölne, Ingeborg Bajema, Elisabeth Sonesson, Mårten Segelmark, Fredrik Uhlinet al.",2022 Apr,J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35260419/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The prognosis for kidney survival is poor in patients presenting with circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies and severe kidney injury. It is unknown if treatment with an endopeptidase that cleaves circulating and kidney bound IgG can alter the prognosis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An investigator-driven phase 2a one-arm study (EudraCT 2016-004082-39) was performed in 17 hospitals in five European countries. A single dose of 0.25 mg/kg of imlifidase was given to 15 adults with circulating anti-GBM antibodies and an eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73m2. All patients received standard treatment with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids, but plasma exchange only if autoantibodies rebounded. The primary outcomes were safety and dialysis independency at 6 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At inclusion, ten patients were dialysis dependent and the other five had eGFR levels between 7 and 14 ml/min per 1.73m2. The median age was 61 years (range 19-77), six were women, and six were also positive for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Then 6 hours after imlifidase infusion, all patients had anti-GBM antibodies levels below the reference range of a prespecified assay. At 6 months 67% (ten out of 15) were dialysis independent. This is significantly higher compared with 18% (nine out of 50) in a historical control cohort (P<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Eight serious adverse events (including one death) were reported, none assessed as probably or possibly related to the study drug.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this pilot study, the use of imlifidase was associated with a better outcome compared with earlier publications, without major safety issues, but the findings need to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.Clinical Trial registration number: EUDRACT 2016-004082-39 https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2007-001377-28/results."
Polymyxin B therapy based on therapeutic drug monitoring in carbapenem-resistant organisms sepsis: the PMB-CROS randomized clinical trial.,"Shaohua Liu#, Ying Wu#, Shaoyan Qi, Huanzhang Shao, Min Feng, Lihua Xing, Hongmei Liu, Yanqiu Gao, Zhiqiang Zhu, Shuguang Zhang, Yuming Du, Yibin Lu, Jing Yang, Pingyan Chen, Tongwen Sun, Shaohua Liuet al.",2023 Jun 13,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37312218/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The appropriate administration regimen of polymyxin B is yet controversial. The present study aimed to explore the optimal dose of polymyxin B under therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) guidance.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In China's Henan province, 26 hospitals participated in a randomized controlled trial. We included patients with sepsis caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CR-GNB) susceptible to polymyxin B. The patients were randomly divided into a high-dose (HD) group or a low-dose (LD) group and received 150 mg loading dose, 75 mg every 12 h and 100 mg loading dose, 50 mg every 12 h, respectively. TDM was employed to determine if the dose of polymyxin B needs adjustment based on the area under the concentration-time curve across 24 h at a steady state (ssAUC0-24) of 50-100 mg h/L. The primary outcome was the 14-day clinical response, and the secondary outcomes included 28- and 14-day mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This trial included 311 patients, with 152 assigned to the HD group and 159 assigned to the LD group. Intention-to-treat analysis showed that the 14-day clinical response was non-significant (p = 0.527): 95/152 (62.5%) in the HD group and 95/159 (59.7%) in the LD group. Kaplan-Meier's 180-day survival curve showed survival advantage in the HD group than in the LD group (p = 0.037). More patients achieved the target ssAUC0-24 in the HD than in the LD group (63.8% vs. 38.9%; p = 0.005) and in the septic shock subgroup compared to all subjects (HD group: 71.4% vs. 63.8%, p = 0.037; LD group: 58.3% vs. 38.9%, p = 0.0005). Also, the target AUC compliance was not correlated with clinical outcomes but with acute kidney injury (AKI) (p = 0.019). Adverse events did not differ between the HD and LD groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A fixed polymyxin B loading dose of 150 mg and a maintenance dose of 75 mg every 12 h was safe for patients with sepsis caused by CR-GNB and improves long-term survival. The increased AUC was associated with increased incidence of AKI, and TDM results were valued to prevent AKI.

Both drugs were administered orally twice per day one day before and on the day of contrast administration. Of the 130 patients enrolled in this study, 10 (7.7%) experienced an increase of at least 0.5 mg/dL (44 μmol/L) in serum creatinine levels 48 h after administration of the contrast agent including 5 of the 67 patients in the NAC group (7.5%) and 5 of the 63 patients in the omega 3 fatty acids group (7.9%; P = 0.919).

      Fluid imbalance is common after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and negatively impacts clinical outcomes. We compared intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) using left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (LVOT-VTI) measured by transesophageal echocardiography with central venous pressure (CVP)-guided fluid therapy during aneurysm clipping in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fifty adults scheduled for urgent craniotomy for aneurysm clipping were randomly allocated to 2 groups: group G (n=25) received GDFT guided by LVOT-VTI and group C (n=25) received CVP-guided fluid management. The primary outcome was intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP). Secondary outcomes included volume of fluid administered and several other intraoperative and postoperative variables, including neurological outcome at hospital discharge and at 30 and 90 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was no difference in MAP between the 2 groups despite patients in group G receiving lower volumes of fluid compared with patients in group C (2503.6±534.3 vs. 3732.8±676.5 mL, respectively; P <0.0001). Heart rate and diastolic blood pressure were also comparable between groups, whereas systolic blood pressure was higher in group G than in group C at several intraoperative time points. Other intraoperative variables, including blood loss, urine output, and lactate levels were not different between the 2 groups. Postoperative variables, including creatinine, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, and incidence of acute kidney injury, pneumonitis, and vasospasm were also comparable between groups. There was no difference in neurological outcome at hospital discharge (modified Rankin scale) and at 30 and 90 days (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale) between the 2 groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Compared with CVP-guided fluid therapy, transesophageal echocardiography-guided GDFT maintains MAP with lower volumes of intravenous fluid in patients undergoing clipping of intracranial aneurysms with no adverse impact on postoperative complications."
"Emicizumab prophylaxis in patients with acquired haemophilia A (GTH-AHA-EMI): an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 study.","Andreas Tiede, Christina Hart, Paul Knöbl, Richard Greil, Johannes Oldenburg, Ulrich J Sachs, Wolfgang Miesbach, Christian Pfrepper, Karolin Trautmann-Grill, Katharina Holstein, Jan Pilch, Patrick Möhnle, Christoph Schindler, Carmen Weigt, Dorothea Schipp, Marcus May, Christiane Dobbelstein, Fabius J Pelzer, Sonja Werwitzke, Robert Klamroth, Andreas Tiedeet al.",2023 Nov,Lancet Haematol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37858328/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acquired haemophilia A is caused by neutralising autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII, leading to severe bleeding. Standard treatment involves immunosuppressive therapy, which is associated with adverse events and mortality in the frail population of patients with acquired haemophilia A. This study investigated whether emicizumab, a factor VIIIa mimetic antibody, protects patients with acquired haemophilia A from bleeding and allows deferral of immunosuppression during the first 12 weeks after diagnosis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We report final results of an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial. Adult patients with acquired haemophilia A from 16 haemophilia treatment centres in Germany and Austria were eligible if they had not previously received immunosuppression. Patients received emicizumab subcutaneously (6 and 3 mg/kg on days 1 and 2, 1·5 mg/kg weekly until week 12), but no immunosuppression. Follow-up was until week 24. The primary endpoint was the number of clinically relevant bleeds per patient-week until week 12. Emicizumab was considered effective if the mean bleeding rate was significantly below 0·15 bleeds per patient-week, the rate observed in a previous study of patients with acquired haemophilia A treated with bypassing agents and immunosuppression but no emicizumab. The study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04188639 and is complete.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Of 49 patients screened from March 25, 2021, to June 10, 2022, 47 were enrolled (23 women, 24 men). Median age was 76 years (IQR 66-80), 46 (98%) of 47 patients were White, median factor VIII activity was 1·4 IU/dL (0·3-5·6), and median inhibitor concentration was 11·4 Bethesda units per mL (3·9-42·7). Mean breakthrough bleeding rate was 0·04 bleeds per patient-week (upper 97·5% CI 0·06). 33 (70%) of 47 patients had no bleeding events, seven patients (15%) had one bleed, six patients (13%) had two bleeds, and one patient (2%) had three bleeds. Adverse events of grade 3 or worse included COVID-19 (n=2), acute kidney injury (n=2), and stroke (n=1). Four of 47 patients died, including two deaths related to bleeding, one from COVID-19, and one from cardiac arrest (none were judged as related to emicizumab).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      This study suggests that emicizumab prophylaxis prevents bleeding in patients with acquired haemophilia A and that immunosuppressive therapy can be deferred while patients are receiving this treatment. The low number of thromboembolic events, severe infections, and fatalities observed in this study are promising.

Patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after ≥ 1 novel androgen-axis drug, either chemotherapy naïve or postchemotherapy, with sufficient bone marrow reserve, normal kidney function, sufficient PSMA expression by PSMA PET, and no PSMA-negative soft-tissue lesions were eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) into 2 activity groups (6.0 or 7.4 GBq per cycle) and received up to 4 cycles every 8 wk. The primary safety endpoint was assessed by collecting and grading adverse events using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Patients were followed until disease progression, death, serious or intolerable adverse events, study termination by sponsor, patient withdrawal, lost to follow-up, or 24 mo after the first cycle. Results: The study was closed at enrollment of 71 of 200 planned patients because of sponsorship transfer. A total of 64 (90.1%) patients received at least 1 cycle of 177Lu-PSMA-617: 28 (36%) in arm 1 (6.0 GBq) and 41 (64%) in arm 2 (7.4 GBq). There were 10 (43.5%), 19 (46.5%), and 29 (45.3%) patients who completed 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the 6.0-GBq arm, 7.4-GBq arm, and overall, respectively. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade in the 6.0-GBq arm, the 7.4-GBq arm and overall, were dry mouth (47.8%; 63.4%; 57.8%, respectively), fatigue (56.5%; 51.2%; 53.1%, respectively), nausea (52.2%; 43.9%; 46.9%, respectively), and diarrhea (13.0%; 31.7%; 25.0%, respectively). Frequencies of all other TEAEs were comparable among the 2 groups (within 10% difference). Serious possibly drug-related TEAEs were reported for 5 (7.8%) patients overall (none were considered as probably or definitely related to treatment): 1 subdural hematoma grade 4, 1 anemia grade 3, 1 thrombocytopenia grade 4, 1 gastrointestinal hemorrhage grade 3, and 1 acute kidney injury grade 3. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs in electrocardiograms in the 2 treatment groups. No trend to creatinine increase or increasing frequency of shifts from normal to abnormal over time for any hematologic parameter was noted. Conclusion:177Lu-PSMA-617 was safe and well-tolerated at 6.0 and 7.4 GBq per cycle given at 8-wk intervals with side effects easily managed with standard medical support. With established safety, further clinical trials applying individualized dosimetry and testing different 177Lu-PSMA-617 administration schemes (activity levels, time intervals) are needed to optimize tumor dose delivery and treatment efficacy."

      We assessed the safety and efficacy of ifosfamide and vinorelbine (IV) as a less toxic and effective reinduction regimen for pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma.
    


          Procedure:
        
      
      This multi-center Children's Oncology Group phase II pilot study enrolled patients <30 years of age with biopsy-proven Hodgkin Lymphoma in relapse or refractory disease after front-line therapy. Treatment consisted of ifosfamide 3,000 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion over 24 hr on Days 1-4 and vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) /dose intravenous push on Days 1 and 5 of each 21 day cycle with cytokine support. The study endpoints included estimation of key toxicities (cardiac, hepatic, or renal toxicity or toxic death), the rate of successful peripheral stem cell harvesting, and response after two cycles of therapy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-six patients received a median of two cycles of IV. Sixty-four of 66 were heavily pretreated, 4 had refractory disease, 55% were male and 79% had nodular sclerosis HL. The primary toxicities were hematologic. Harvested peripheral stem cells were sufficient for autologous transplantation in 46 of 54 patients for whom stem cell collection was attempted. The overall response rate (72%; 95% CI 59-83%) permitted the majority of patients to undergo subsequent stem cell transplantation.

      IV is a safe and effective re-induction regimen for salvage of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma with an excellent response rate and success of post chemotherapy stem cell harvest. It avoids the use of etoposide, an agent associated with secondary malignancy after stem cell transplantation."
Annexin A1 is a Potential Novel Biomarker of Congestion in Acute Heart Failure.,"Fadi W Adel, Aruna Rikhi, Siu-Hin Wan, Seethalakshmi R Iyer, Hrishikesh Chakraborty, Steven McNulty, W H Wilson Tang, G Michael Felker, Michael M Givertz, Horng H Chen, Fadi W Adelet al.",2020 Aug,J Card Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32473378/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      This study sought to identify the role of annexin A1 (AnxA1) as a congestion marker in acute heart failure (AHF) and to identify its putative role in predicting clinical outcomes.
    


          Background:
        
      
      AnxA1 is a protein that inhibits inflammation following ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiorenal tissues. Because AHF is a state of tissue hypoperfusion, we hypothesized that plasma AnxA1 levels are altered in AHF.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In the Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation (ROSE) trial, patients hospitalized for AHF with kidney injury were randomized to receive dopamine, nesiritide, or placebo for 72 hours in addition to diuresis. In a subanalysis, plasma AnxA1 levels were measured at baseline and at 72 hours in 275 patients. Participants were divided into 3 tertiles based on their baseline AnxA1 levels.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The prevalence of peripheral edema 2+ increased with increasing AnxA1 levels (P < .007). Cystatin C, blood urea nitrogen, and kidney injury molecule-1 plasma levels were higher among participants in tertile 3 vs tertiles 1 or 2 (P< .05). Patients with a congestion score of 4 had a mean baseline AnxA1 level 8.63 units higher than those with a congestion score of 0 (P = .03). Patients in tertiles 2 and 3 were twice as likely to experience creatinine elevation as patients in tertile 1 (P = .03). Patients in tertiles 2 and 3 were at a higher risk of 60-day all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization and 180-day all-cause mortality (P < .05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients hospitalized for AHF with impaired kidney function, elevated AnxA1 levels are associated with worse congestion, higher risk for further creatinine elevation, and higher rates of 60-day morbidity or all-cause mortality and 180-day all-cause mortality.

Serelaxin as a potential treatment for renal dysfunction in cirrhosis: Preclinical evaluation and results of a randomized phase 2 trial.,"Victoria K Snowdon, Neil J Lachlan, Anna M Hoy, Patrick W F Hadoke, Scott I Semple, Dilip Patel, Will Mungall, Timothy J Kendall, Adrian Thomson, Ross J Lennen, Maurits A Jansen, Carmel M Moran, Antonella Pellicoro, Prakash Ramachandran, Isaac Shaw, Rebecca L Aucott, Thomas Severin, Rajnish Saini, Judy Pak, Denise Yates, Neelesh Dongre, Jeremy S Duffield, David J Webb, John P Iredale, Peter C Hayes, Jonathan A Fallowfield, Victoria K Snowdonet al.",2017 Feb 28,PLoS Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28245243/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Chronic liver scarring from any cause leads to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and a progressive decline in renal blood flow and renal function. Extreme renal vasoconstriction characterizes hepatorenal syndrome, a functional and potentially reversible form of acute kidney injury in patients with advanced cirrhosis, but current therapy with systemic vasoconstrictors is ineffective in a substantial proportion of patients and is limited by ischemic adverse events. Serelaxin (recombinant human relaxin-2) is a peptide molecule with anti-fibrotic and vasoprotective properties that binds to relaxin family peptide receptor-1 (RXFP1) and has been shown to increase renal perfusion in healthy human volunteers. We hypothesized that serelaxin could ameliorate renal vasoconstriction and renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
    


          Methods and findings:
        
      
      To establish preclinical proof of concept, we developed two independent rat models of cirrhosis that were characterized by progressive reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and showed evidence of renal endothelial dysfunction. We then set out to further explore and validate our hypothesis in a phase 2 randomized open-label parallel-group study in male and female patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Forty patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with serelaxin intravenous (i.v.) infusion (for 60 min at 80 μg/kg/d and then 60 min at 30 μg/kg/d) or terlipressin (single 2-mg i.v. bolus), and the regional hemodynamic effects were quantified by phase contrast magnetic resonance angiography at baseline and after 120 min. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total renal artery blood flow. Therapeutic targeting of renal vasoconstriction with serelaxin in the rat models increased kidney perfusion, oxygenation, and function through reduction in renal vascular resistance, reversal of endothelial dysfunction, and increased activation of the AKT/eNOS/NO signaling pathway in the kidney. In the randomized clinical study, infusion of serelaxin for 120 min increased total renal arterial blood flow by 65% (95% CI 40%, 95%; p < 0.001) from baseline. Administration of serelaxin was safe and well tolerated, with no detrimental effect on systemic blood pressure or hepatic perfusion. The clinical study's main limitations were the relatively small sample size and stable, well-compensated population.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our mechanistic findings in rat models and exploratory study in human cirrhosis suggest the therapeutic potential of selective renal vasodilation using serelaxin as a new treatment for renal dysfunction in cirrhosis, although further validation in patients with more advanced cirrhosis and renal dysfunction is required.

Efficacy and Safety of Besifovir Dipivoxil Maleate Compared With Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate in Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection.,"Sang Hoon Ahn, Won Kim, Young Kul Jung, Jin Mo Yang, Jae Young Jang, Yong Oh Kweon, Yong Kyun Cho, Yoon Jun Kim, Gun Young Hong, Dong Joon Kim, Soon Ho Um, Joo Hyun Sohn, Jin Woo Lee, Sung Jae Park, Byung Seok Lee, Ju Hyun Kim, Hong Soo Kim, Seung Kew Yoon, Moon Young Kim, Hyung Joon Yim, Kwan Sik Lee, Young Suk Lim, Wan Sik Lee, Neung Hwa Park, So Young Jin, Kyun-Hwan Kim, Won Choi, Kwang-Hyub Han, Sang Hoon Ahnet al.",2019 Aug,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30448598/,No keywords found,"Background & aims:
        
      
      Besifovir dipivoxil maleate (BSV) has activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). We performed a phase 3 study to compare the antiviral efficacy and safety of BSV vs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in patients with chronic HBV infection in Korea.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a double-blind, non-inferiority trial of 197 patients with chronic HBV infection at 22 sites in South Korea, from November 2013 through February 2016. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given BSV (150 mg, n = 99) or TDF (300 mg, n = 98) for 48 weeks. We evaluated virologic responses to therapy (HBV DNA <69 IU/mL or 400 copies/ml), bone mineral density (BMD), and renal outcomes for safety analysis. The main efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a virologic response at week 48. After 48 weeks, TDF was switched to BSV (150 mg) for an additional 48 weeks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After 48 weeks of treatment, 80.9% of patients given BSV and 84.9% of patients given TDF met the efficacy endpoint, indicating the non-inferiority of BSV to TDF. At week 96, 87.2% of patients in the BSV-BSV and 85.7% of patients in the TDF-BSV had a virologic response. At week 48, changes in hip and spine BMD differed significantly between the BSV and TDF groups, whereas the estimated glomerular filtration rate in the TDF group was significantly lower than that in the BSV group. However, at 96 weeks, there were no significant differences in BMD and estimated glomerular filtration rate between the BSV-BSV and TDF-BSV groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      BSV has antiviral efficacy comparable to that of TDF after 48 weeks of treatment, with durable effects for 96 weeks. BSV has a better safety profile than TDF, in terms of bone and renal outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT01937806."
"Effects of remote ischemic conditioning on kidney injury in at-risk patients undergoing elective coronary angiography (PREPARE study): a multicenter, randomized clinical trial.","François Roubille, Jean-Christophe Macia, Fabrice Ivanes, Denis Angoulvant, Victor Mateus, Loïc Belle, Meyer Elbaz, Olivier Morel, Alain Furber, Loïc Bière, Fabrice Prunier, François Roubilleet al.",2019 Aug 19,Sci Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31427688/,No keywords found,"The ability of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) following percutaneous coronary angiography in at-risk patients is controversial. No evidence exists regarding potential RIPC positive effects on renal function and clinical outcomes in the long-term. The PREPARE study was a randomized, prospective, multicenter, and double-blinded trial. A total of 222 patients scheduled for coronary angiography and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 40 mL/min/1.73 m2, or eGFR between 40 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and two further risk factors were allocated to RIPC or control groups. Preventive measures were applied to all patients, including continuous intravenous saline infusion, withdrawal of nephrotoxic drugs, and limited volume of contrast medium. The primary endpoint, namely incidence of CIN, was 3.8% in the control group and 5.1% in the RIPC group (p = 0.74). The secondary endpoints, i.e., changes in serum creatinine and eGFR levels from baseline to 48 hours and from baseline to 12 months following contrast medium exposure, did not differ between both groups. The incidences of all major clinical events at 12 months were similar in both groups. In this population at risk of CIN, preventive strategies were associated with low CIN incidence. RIPC impacted neither the CIN incidence nor both the renal function and clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up."
Heparin calcium treated Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis in children through inhibiting hyperfibrinolysis.,"Ming Tian, Cuihua Liu, Ming Tianet al.",2015 Aug,Ren Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26133741/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      To explore the underlying mechanism of low-molecular-weight heparin calcium therapy on Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eighty-nine children with severe HSPN were randomized into control group (treated with conventional therapy, n = 45) and treatment group (treated with conventional therapy plus low-molecular-weight heparin calcium, n = 44). The concentrations of plasma fibrinogen (Fg), d-dimer and fibrin degradation products (FDPs) were detected before and after treatment. The urinary red blood cell (RBC) and 24 h proteinuria were determined weekly for assessing the children's kidney function.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two groups were well-matched at baseline. After 8 weeks of treatment, the clinical outcomes of HSPN and outcome of proteinuria of the treatment group were better than the control group (p < 0.05); the content of Fg, d-dimer and FDP in plasma of the treatment group were lower than the control group (p < 0.05); but there was no difference about the curative effect of hematuria and the coagulation function between the two groups (p > 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Fibrinolytic system may participate in the kidney injury of HSPN children and low-molecular-weight heparin calcium could correct blood hypercoagulability through inhibiting hyperfibrinolysis, and thus improving the blood supply of kidney."
Perioperative multi-system optimization protocol in elderly hip fracture patients: a randomized-controlled trial.,"Sebastian Schmid, Manfred Blobner, Brigitte Haas, Martin Lucke, Markus Neumaier, Aida Anetsberger, Bettina Jungwirth, Sebastian Schmidet al.",2019 Dec,Can J Anaesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31531828/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Hip fractures in elderly patients are associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. We evaluated whether a perioperative multi-system optimization protocol can reduce postoperative complications in these patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Immediately after diagnosis of hip fracture, patients ≥ 60 yr were randomized to an intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group were admitted to our postanesthesia care unit where they were treated with goal-directed hemodynamic management, optimized pain therapy, oxygen therapy, and optimized nutrition. Patients in the control group were managed according to our usual standard of care on a regular ward. Postoperative complications during hospital stay included pre-determined cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, renal, or surgical events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of at least one postoperative complication (primary outcome) was seen in 32 of 65 (49%) controls compared with 24 of 62 (39%) in the intervention group (relative risk [RR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 1.17; P = 0.23). The secondary unadjusted outcomes showed that patients in the intervention group received more Ringer's acetate compared with controls (median difference, 1.3 L; 95% CI, 0.6 to 2.1 L; P < 0.001), had more frequently a mean arterial pressure > 70 mmHg (57% control vs 75% intervention; median percentage difference, 16%; 95% CI, 7 to 25%; P = 0.001), better pain control (numeric rating scale < 4 at all postoperative measurements; 25% control vs 81% intervention; RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.43; P < 0.001), and possibly a lower incidence of acute renal failure (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.98; P = 0.04).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The implementation of a perioperative multi-system optimization protocol algorithm did not significantly reduce the risk of postoperative complications. Nevertheless, we likely over-estimated the potential treatment effect in our study design and thus were under-powered to show an effect.

Forced fluid removal versus usual care in intensive care patients with high-risk acute kidney injury and severe fluid overload (FFAKI): study protocol for a randomised controlled pilot trial.,"Rasmus E Berthelsen, Theis Itenov, Anders Perner, Jens-Ulrik Jensen, Michael Ibsen, Andreas Emil Kryger Jensen, Morten Bestle, Rasmus E Berthelsenet al.",2017 Apr 24,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28438182/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intravenous administration of fluids is an essential part of critical care. While some fluid administration is likely beneficial, there is increasing observational evidence that the development of fluid overload is associated with increased mortality. There are no randomised trials to confirm this association in patients with acute kidney injury. We aim to perform a pilot trial to test the feasibility of forced fluid removal compared to standard care in patients with acute kidney injury and severe fluid overload, the FFAKI trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Then FFAKI trial is a pilot, multicentre, randomised clinical trial recruiting adult intensive care patients with acute kidney injury and fluid overload, defined as more than 10% of ideal bodyweight. Patients are randomised with concealed allocation to either standard care or forced fluid removal with a therapeutic target of negative net fluid balance ≥1 mL/kg/h. The safety of fluid removal is continually evaluated according to predefined criteria of hypoperfusion: lactate ≥4 mmol/L, mean arterial pressure <50 mmHg or mottling beyond the edge of the kneecaps. If patients fulfil one of these criteria, fluid removal is suspended until hypoperfusion has resolved. The primary outcome measure is fluid balance at 5 days after randomisation and secondary outcomes include mean daily fluid balance, fluid balance at discharge from the intensive care unit, time to neutral fluid balance, number of serious adverse reactions and number of protocol violations. All patients are followed for 90 days.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The FFAKI trial started in October 2015 and, when completed, will provide data to evaluate whether a large trial of forced fluid removal in critically ill patients is feasible. Our primary outcome will show if the experimental intervention leads to a clinically relevant difference in fluid balance, which could prove beneficial in intensive care patients with acute kidney injury.

A phase I/II study of the safety and efficacy of [177Lu]Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan in advanced somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumours.,"Damian Wild, Henning Grønbæk, Shaunak Navalkissoor, Alexander Haug, Guillaume P Nicolas, Ben Pais, Catherine Ansquer, Jean-Mathieu Beauregard, Alexander McEwan, Michael Lassmann, Daniele Pennestri, Magali Volteau, Nat P Lenzo, Rodney J Hicks, Damian Wildet al.",2023 Dec,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37721581/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      We present the results of an open-label, phase I/II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the novel somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonist [177Lu]Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan in 40 patients with previously treated, progressive neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), in which dosimetry was used to guide maximum administered activity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study was conducted in two parts. Part A consisted of 15 patients who completed three cycles of [177Lu]Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan at a fixed administered activity and peptide amount per cycle (4.5 GBq/300 µg). Part B, which included 25 patients who received one to five cycles of [177Lu]Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan, evaluated different administered activities (4.5 or 6.0 GBq/cycle) and peptide amounts (300, 700, or 1300 μg/cycle), limited to a cumulative absorbed radiation dose of 23 Gy to the kidneys and 1.5 Gy to the bone marrow.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median cumulative administered activity of [177Lu]Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan was 13.0 GBq over three cycles (13.1 GBq in part A and 12.9 GBq in part B). Overall, 17 (42.5%) patients experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment‑related adverse events; the most common were lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. No grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity was observed. Two patients developed myeloid neoplasms considered treatment related by the investigator. Disease control rate for part A and part B was 94.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.3-99.4), and overall response rate was 21.1% (95% CI: 9.6-37.3).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      [177Lu]Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan, administered at a median cumulative activity of 13.0 GBq over three cycles, has an acceptable safety profile with a promising clinical response in patients with progressive, SSTR-positive NETs. A 5-year long-term follow-up study is ongoing.

"Safety and efficacy of azilsartan in paediatric patients with hypertension: a phase 3, single-arm, open-label, prospective study.","Shuichi Ito, Yuya Nishiyama, Kenkichi Sugiura, Kazuaki Enya, Shuichi Itoet al.",2022 Apr,Clin Exp Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34837606/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Azilsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker indicated for the treatment of adult hypertension. A previous single-dose study suggested that azilsartan may also be a promising agent for paediatric hypertension. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of azilsartan in children have not been established.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a phase 3, single-arm, open-label, prospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of azilsartan in pediatric patients with hypertension. Twenty-seven patients aged 6-15 years were treated with once-daily azilsartan for 52 weeks. The starting dose was 2.5 mg for patients weighing < 50 kg (N = 22) and 5 mg for patients weighing ≥ 50 kg (N = 5), with doses titrated up to a maximum of 20 and 40 mg, respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Azilsartan showed acceptable tolerability at doses up to 20 mg in patients weighing < 50 kg and 40 mg in those weighing ≥ 50 kg. Most drug-related adverse events (AEs) were mild, with one patient (3.7%) experiencing a severe and serious drug-related AE (acute kidney injury). One patient (3.7%) had a mild increase in serum creatinine level, which resolved after treatment discontinuation. The blood pressure-lowering effect of azilsartan was observed as early as Week 2. Overall, approximately half of the patients achieved their target blood pressure at the end of azilsartan treatment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study suggests that azilsartan has an acceptable safety profile in hypertensive patients aged 6-15 years. Azilsartan may be a promising agent for treating paediatric hypertension."

      Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) adversely affects long-term kidney outcomes and survival. Administration of the detoxifying enzyme alkaline phosphatase may improve kidney function and survival.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine the optimal therapeutic dose, effect on kidney function, and adverse effects of a human recombinant alkaline phosphatase in patients who are critically ill with sepsis-associated AKI.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      The STOP-AKI trial was an international (53 recruiting sites), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, adaptive phase 2a/2b study in 301 adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of sepsis and AKI. Patients were enrolled between December 2014 and May 2017, and follow-up was conducted for 90 days. The final date of follow-up was August 14, 2017.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      In the intention-to-treat analysis, in part 1 of the trial, patients were randomized to receive recombinant alkaline phosphatase in a dosage of 0.4 mg/kg (n = 31), 0.8 mg/kg (n = 32), or 1.6 mg/kg (n = 29) or placebo (n = 30), once daily for 3 days, to establish the optimal dose. The optimal dose was identified as 1.6 mg/kg based on modeling approaches and adverse events. In part 2, 1.6 mg/kg (n = 82) was compared with placebo (n = 86).
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary end point was the time-corrected area under the curve of the endogenous creatinine clearance for days 1 through 7, divided by 7 to provide a mean daily creatinine clearance (AUC1-7 ECC). Incidence of fatal and nonfatal (serious) adverse events ([S]AEs) was also determined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 301 patients were enrolled (men, 70.7%; median age, 67 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 59-73]). From day 1 to day 7, median ECC increased from 26.0 mL/min (IQR, 8.8 to 59.5) to 65.4 mL/min (IQR, 26.7 to 115.4) in the recombinant alkaline phosphatase 1.6-mg/kg group vs from 35.9 mL/min (IQR, 12.2 to 82.9) to 61.9 mL/min (IQR, 22.7 to 115.2) in the placebo group (absolute difference, 9.5 mL/min [95% CI, -23.9 to 25.5]; P = .47). Fatal adverse events occurred in 26.3% of patients in the 0.4-mg/kg recombinant alkaline phosphatase group; 17.1% in the 0.8-mg/kg group, 17.4% in the 1.6-mg/kg group, and 29.5% in the placebo group. Rates of nonfatal SAEs were 21.0% for the 0.4-mg/kg recombinant alkaline phosphatase group, 14.3% for the 0.8-mg/kg group, 25.7% for the 1.6-mg/kg group, and 20.5% for the placebo group.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients who were critically ill with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury, human recombinant alkaline phosphatase compared with placebo did not significantly improve short-term kidney function. Further research is necessary to assess other clinical outcomes.

PEAR1 is not a human hypertension-susceptibility gene.,"Laura Olivi, Christophe Vandenbriele, Yu-Mei Gu, Erika Salvi, Simona Delli Carpini, Yan-Ping Liu, Lotte Jacobs, Yu Jin, Lutgarde Thijs, Lorena Citterio, Daniele Cusi, Peter Verhamme, Jan A Staessen, Laura Oliviet al.",2015 Feb,Blood Press,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25541647/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      Platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1 (PEAR1) is a membrane protein involved in platelet contact-induced activation and sustained platelet aggregation. Experimental studies identified PEAR1, as a candidate gene that may be linked to the blood-pressure driven kidney injury in salt-sensitive Dahl rats.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      In a family-based European population study (mean age 39.7 years; 52.2% women), we searched for association of changes in blood pressure or incidence of hypertension with genetic variation in PEAR1.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Among 1973 randomly recruited people, genotyped for PEAR1, we measured blood pressure at baseline and follow-up.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median follow-up was 10.0 years. While accounting for family clusters and blood pressure at baseline and with adjustments applied for sex, age, body mass index, smoking and drinking, total cholesterol, and antihypertensive drug treatment, all associations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes with nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PEAR1 were all non-significant (p ≥ 0.059). With similar adjustments, the incidence of hypertension (397 cases among 1532 participants were normotensive at baseline [25.9%]) was not related to the SNPs in PEAR1 (hazard ratios ≤ 1.09; p ≥ 0.09).

      This open-label, phase I study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in children with acute leukaemia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      PEG-rhG-CSF was administered as a single 100 mcg/kg (3 mg maximum dose) subcutaneous injection at the end of each chemotherapy period when neutropenia occurred. Blood samples were obtained from patients treated with PEG-rhG-CSF. PEG-rhG-CSF serum concentrations were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis was implemented using the nonlinear mixed-effects model. Short-term safety was evaluated through adverse events collection (registered at clinicaltrials.gov identifier: 03844360).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 16 acute leukaemia patients (1.8-13.6 years) were included, of whom two (12.5%) had grade 3 neutropenia, six (37.5%) had grade 4 neutropenia, and eight (50.0%) had severe neutropenia. For PPK modelling, 64 PEG-rhG-CSF serum concentrations were obtainable. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination was used for pharmacokinetic data modelling. The current weight was a significant covariate. The median (range) of clearance (CL) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) were 5.65 (1.49-14.45) mL/h/kg and 16514.75 (6632.45-54423.30) ng·h/mL, respectively. Bone pain, pyrexia, anaphylaxis and nephrotoxicity were not observed. One patient died 13 days after administration, and the objective assessment of causality was that an association with PEG-rhG-CSF was ""possible"".
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The AUC of PEG-rhG-CSF (100 mcg/kg, 3 mg maximum dose) in paediatric patients with acute leukaemia were similar to those of PEG-rhG-CSF (100 mcg/kg) in children with sarcoma. PEG-rhG-CSF is safe, representing an important therapeutic option for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in paediatric patients with acute leukaemia."
Combined erythropoietin and iron therapy for anaemic patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: the EPICURE randomised clinical trial.,"Marina Urena, Maria Del Trigo, Omar Abdul-Jawad Altisent, Francisco Campelo-Prada, Ander Regueiro, Robert DeLarochellière, Daniel Doyle, Siamak Mohammadi, Jean-Michel Paradis, François Dagenais, Eric Dumont, Rishi Puri, Vincent Laroche, Josep Rodés-Cabau, Marina Urenaet al.",2017 May 15,EuroIntervention,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28067195/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to evaluate, in anaemic patients, the efficacy of erythropoietin (EPO) in reducing red cell (RC) transfusion rates post TAVI.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      This was a randomised double-blind trial. Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and concomitant anaemia with an indication for TAVI were randomised (1:1) to receive two weight-based doses of EPO (darbepoetin alfa)+iron or placebo at days 10 (±4 days) and 1 (±1 day) pre TAVI. The primary outcome was the rate of RC transfusions at 30 days. A total of 100 patients (mean age 81±7 years, male 49%) were included: 48 patients received EPO (+iron) and 52 patients received placebo. Baseline characteristics and procedural findings were well balanced between groups except for baseline haemoglobin levels, which were lower in those patients receiving EPO (10.7±1.2 vs. 11.3±1.1 g/dl, p=0.01). The rate of 30-day RC transfusion was similar in both groups (27.1 vs. 25.0% in the EPO and placebo groups, respectively; adjusted odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI: 0.42-2.64, p=0.92), and no differences were observed in the number of RC units per transfused patient (1 [1-3] vs. 2 [1-2] in the EPO and placebo groups, respectively, adjusted p=0.99). Rates of 30-day mortality, stroke, new-onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and troponin peak were also similar between groups (p>0.20 for all).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      EPO (+iron) administration failed to reduce RC transfusion rates or the per-patient number of transfusion units in anaemic patients undergoing TAVI."

Limited research indicates that lung ultrasound (LUS) may enhance the care for patients with ADHF. Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of LUS-guided diuretic therapy on reducing length of hospital stay (LOS) and 90-day readmissions among patients with ADHF. Methods This open-label, non-randomized clinical trial included patients with ADHF managed with diuretics based on LUS findings of B-lines and pleural effusion (LUS group) compared to those receiving standard care (control group). The primary outcome was LOS during the index admission, and secondary outcomes included 90-day ADHF readmissions, all-cause readmissions, and safety parameters like acute kidney injury, hypokalemia, and hypotension. Results The study included a total of 77 patients, segregated into two groups: control and LUS. The median age of the patients was 68 years, with women slightly outnumbering men (53.25%, n=41). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (88.31%, n=68), diabetes mellitus (59.74%, n=46), and chronic kidney disease (66.23%, n=51). The LUS group had a shorter LOS, though not statistically significant (4 vs five days, p= 0.175). Patients in the LUS group had significantly fewer 90-day ADHF readmissions compared to the control group (10.53% vs. 35.9%; p<0.01). Survival analysis demonstrated that the LUS group had a longer time to 90-day ADHF readmissions, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.24 (95% CI: 0.08-0.75, p=0.014). For 90-day all-cause readmissions, the LUS group also showed a longer time to readmission compared to controls, with an HR of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.200-1.005, p=0.046). For other safety measures, there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events, including acute kidney injury, hypokalaemia, or hypotension, between the LUS and control groups. Conclusion LUS might reduce in-hospital mortality and readmissions among adults with acute decompensated HF. However, further double-blinded randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these preliminary results."
"Characterization of immune cell, endothelial, and renal responses upon experimental human endotoxemia.","Eveline P van Poelgeest, Marlous R Dillingh, Marieke de Kam, Karen E Malone, Marleen Kemper, Erik S G Stroes, Jacobus Burggraaf, Matthijs Moerland, Eveline P van Poelgeestet al.",2018 Jan-Feb:89:39-46.,J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29056520/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Although the effects of relatively high concentrations of endotoxin on endothelial activation/dysfunction and kidney markers has been described in literature, detailed insight in the LPS concentration-effect relationship, the magnitude, variability and timing of the response, and potential effects of endotoxemia on the kidneys is lacking. A study was performed to assess the effects of low- to moderate dose (0.5, 1 or 2ng/kg) endotoxemia on the endothelium and kidneys as measured by a panel of novel highly sensitive kidney injury markers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with single ascending doses of LPS (0.5, 1 or 2ng/kg) administered to healthy male volunteers (3 cohorts of 8 subjects, LPS:placebo 6:2). Endothelial measures included selectins, cell adhesion molecules, and thrombomodulin. Renal measures included novel, sensitive and specific biomarkers of acute kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Endotoxin exposure resulted in consistent LPS dose-dependent responses in inflammatory markers, E- and P- Selectin, VCAM1, ICAM1, and thrombomodulin. The observed biological responses were transient, reaching a level of significance of at least <0.01 in the highest dose group and with an effect size which was dependent on the administered LPS dose. LPS-induced inflammatory and endothelial effects did not translate into a change in renal damage biomarkers, although at 2ng/kg LPS, subtle and transient biomarker changes were observed that may relate to (subclinical) tubular damage.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      We demonstrated that administration of a single LPS dose of 2ng/kg to healthy volunteers results in significant inflammatory and endothelial responses, without inducing clinically relevant signs of kidney injury. These findings support the application of the human endotoxemia model in future clinical pharmacology studies."

          Methods:
        
      
      All patients had one or two prior regimens with measurable disease. Tumors were at least 50% clear cell histomorphology and negative for WT-1 antigen and estrogen receptor expression by immunohistochemistry. Sunitinib 50 mg per day for 4 weeks was administered in repeated 6-week cycles until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months and clinical response. The study was designed to determine if the drug had a response rate of at least 20% or 6-month PFS of at least 25%.

      Colistin is recommended in the empirical treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with a high prevalence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (CR-GNB). However, the efficacy and safety of colistin are not well defined.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multicenter prospective randomized trial conducted in 32 European centers compared the efficacy and safety of colistin (4.5 million unit loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 3 million units every 8 h) versus meropenem (2 g every 8 h), both in combination with levofloxacin (500 mg every 12 h) for 7-14 days in patients with late VAP. Between May 2012 and October 2015, 232 patients were randomly assigned to the 2 treatment groups. The primary endpoint was mortality at 28 days after randomization in the microbiologically modified intention-to-treat (mMITT) population. Secondary outcomes included clinical and microbiological cure, renal function at the end of the treatment, and serious adverse events. The study was interrupted after the interim analysis due to excessive nephrotoxicity in the colistin group; therefore, the sample size was not achieved.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 157 (67.7%) patients were included in the mMITT population, 36 of whom (22.9%) had VAP caused by CR-GNB. In the mMITT population, no significant difference in mortality between the colistin group (19/82, 23.2%) and the meropenem group (19/75, 25.3%) was observed, with a risk difference of - 2.16 (- 15.59 to 11.26, p = 0.377); the noninferiority of colistin was not demonstrated due to early termination and limited number of patients infected by carbapenem-resistant pathogens. Colistin plus levofloxacin increased the incidence of renal failure (40/120, 33.3%, versus 21/112, 18.8%; p = 0.012) and renal replacement therapy (11/120, 9.1%, versus 2/112, 1.8%; p = 0.015).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study did not demonstrate the noninferiority of colistin compared with meropenem, both combined with levofloxacin, in terms of efficacy in the empirical treatment of late VAP but demonstrated the greater nephrotoxicity of colistin. These findings do not support the empirical use of colistin for the treatment of late VAP due to early termination.

Effect of bardoxolone methyl on the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 4 chronic kidney disease.,"Peter Rossing, Geoffrey A Block, Melanie P Chin, Angie Goldsberry, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Peter A McCullough, Colin J Meyer, David Packham, Pablo E Pergola, Bruce Spinowitz, Stuart M Sprague, David G Warnock, Glenn M Chertow, Peter Rossinget al.",2019 Oct,Kidney Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31377056/,"albuminuria, chronic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, oxidative stress.","Bardoxolone methyl attenuates inflammation by inducing nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 and suppressing nuclear factor κB. The Bardoxolone Methyl Evaluation in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease and Type 2 Diabetes (BEACON) trial was a phase 3 placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, international, multicenter trial in 2185 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 4 chronic kidney disease. BEACON was terminated because of safety concerns, largely related to a significant increase in early heart failure events in patients randomized to bardoxolone methyl. Bardoxolone methyl resulted in increased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Herein, we present post hoc analyses characterizing the relation between the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and eGFR. The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and eGFR were assessed every four weeks through Week 12, followed by assessments every eight weeks thereafter, and 4 weeks after the last dose of bardoxolone methyl was administered. The initial increases in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio observed in patients randomized to bardoxolone methyl were attenuated after six months. Multivariable regression analysis identified baseline eGFR and eGFR over time as the dominant factors associated with change in the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Relative to placebo, bardoxolone methyl resulted in a significant decrease in albuminuria when indexed to eGFR (least-squared means: -0.035 [95% confidence interval -0.031 to -0.039]). Thus, among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 4 chronic kidney disease treated with bardoxolone methyl, changes in albuminuria are directly related to changes in eGFR, challenging the conventional construct that increases in albuminuria universally reflect kidney injury and denote harm."
Preprocedural Prediction Model for Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Patients.,"Wen-Jun Yin, Yi-Hu Yi, Xiao-Feng Guan, Ling-Yun Zhou, Jiang-Lin Wang, Dai-Yang Li, Xiao-Cong Zuo, Wen-Jun Yinet al.",2017 Feb 3,J Am Heart Assoc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28159819/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Several models have been developed for prediction of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN); however, they only contain patients receiving intra-arterial contrast media for coronary angiographic procedures, which represent a small proportion of all contrast procedures. In addition, most of them evaluate radiological interventional procedure-related variables. So it is necessary for us to develop a model for prediction of CIN before radiological procedures among patients administered contrast media.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      A total of 8800 patients undergoing contrast administration were randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to development and validation data sets. CIN was defined as an increase of 25% and/or 0.5 mg/dL in serum creatinine within 72 hours above the baseline value. Preprocedural clinical variables were used to develop the prediction model from the training data set by the machine learning method of random forest, and 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the prediction accuracies of the model. Finally we tested this model in the validation data set. The incidence of CIN was 13.38%. We built a prediction model with 13 preprocedural variables selected from 83 variables. The model obtained an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.907 and gave prediction accuracy of 80.8%, sensitivity of 82.7%, specificity of 78.8%, and Matthews correlation coefficient of 61.5%. For the first time, 3 new factors are included in the model: the decreased sodium concentration, the INR value, and the preprocedural glucose level.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The newly established model shows excellent predictive ability of CIN development and thereby provides preventative measures for CIN."

      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) -containing regimens have been associated with nephrotoxicity and hypophosphatemia in HIV-infected patients. The objective of this study was to assess the possible risk factors for hypophosphatemia and evaluate the relationship between fractional excretion of filtered phosphate (FePi) and hypophosphatemia in TDF users.
    


          Patient and methods:
        
      
      Patients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study between January 2011 and December 2014. We classified experienced HIV-infected patients (individuals maintained on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 6 months or more) and naïve patients into 3 treatment groups: TDF-containing ART (group 1), non-TDF-containing ART (never received TDF or had not received TDF in the past 6 months; group 2) and naive to antiretroviral therapy (group 3). Specimens from each individual were assessed for serum phosphate, serum creatinine, urine phosphate, and urine creatinine. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to control for the following variables measured at baseline: eGFR, age, sex, sexual orientation, injection drug use (IDUs), HIV-RNA viral load, and CD4 cell count.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The frequency of hypophosphatemia in groups 1, 2, and 3 was 20.2%, 7.2%, and 14.6%, respectively (P = 0.002). FePi above 10% also was significantly associated with hypophosphatemia (P = 0.003; adjusted odds ratio = 2.54). Patients with elevated CD4 cell counts (>500 cells/μL) exhibited a lower risk of hypophosphatemia (P = 0.002; adjusted odds ratio = 0.35).

      Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is commonly administered for selectively inhaled pulmonary vasodilation and prevention of oxidative injury after lung transplant (LT). Inhaled epoprostenol (iEPO) has been introduced worldwide as a cost-saving alternative to iNO without high-grade evidence for this indication.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To investigate whether the use of iEPO will lead to similar rates of severe/grade 3 primary graft dysfunction (PGD-3) after adult LT when compared with use of iNO.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This health system-funded, randomized, blinded (to participants, clinicians, data managers, and the statistician), parallel-designed, equivalence clinical trial included 201 adult patients who underwent single or bilateral LT between May 30, 2017, and March 21, 2020. Patients were grouped into 5 strata according to key prognostic clinical features and randomized per stratum to receive either iNO or iEPO at the time of LT via 1:1 treatment allocation.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Treatment with iNO or iEPO initiated in the operating room before lung allograft reperfusion and administered continously until cessation criteria met in the intensive care unit (ICU).
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was PGD-3 development at 24, 48, or 72 hours after LT. The primary analysis was for equivalence using a two one-sided test (TOST) procedure (90% CI) with a margin of 19% for between-group PGD-3 risk difference. Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU lengths of stay, incidence and severity of acute kidney injury, postoperative tracheostomy placement, and in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality rates. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed for the primary and secondary outcomes, supplemented by per-protocol analysis for the primary outcome.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 201 randomized patients met eligibility criteria at the time of LT (129 men [64.2%]). In the intention-to-treat population, 103 patients received iEPO and 98 received iNO. The primary outcome occurred in 46 of 103 patients (44.7%) in the iEPO group and 39 of 98 (39.8%) in the iNO group, leading to a risk difference of 4.9% (TOST 90% CI, -6.4% to 16.2%; P = .02 for equivalence). There were no significant between-group differences for secondary outcomes.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients undergoing LT, use of iEPO was associated with similar risks for PGD-3 development and other postoperative outcomes compared with the use of iNO.

      The aim of the colchicine on-admission to reduce inflammation in acute coronary syndrome (COLOR-ACS) study is to evaluate the effects of the addition of short-term, low-dose colchicine to high-dose atorvastatin in limiting levels of inflammatory markers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The COLOR-ACS study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-arm trial. Statin-naive patients with NSTE-ACS, scheduled for an early invasive strategy, are randomized on admission to receive standard treatment of atorvastatin 80 mg or standard treatment plus colchicine (1 mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg/day until discharge). The main exclusion criteria are prior statin and/or colchicine treatment, current treatment with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein or immunosuppressive drugs, known active malignancy, severe kidney, cardiac, liver disease. There is clinical and biochemical follow-up at 30 days after discharge and telephone interview at 6 months. The primary end point is the change in hs-CRP from admission to discharge. Secondary end points include: incidence of acute kidney injury; MB fraction of creatine kinase peak value; glomerular filtration rate change from baseline to 30 days; persistence of hs-CRP ≥2 mg/dl at 30 days; adverse clinical events within 30 days; tolerance to colchicine.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The COLOR-ACS study will provide evidence on the efficacy of early short-term treatment with colchicine in addition to high-dose atorvastatin compared to atorvastatin alone in ACS patients. The potential anti-inflammatory action of colchicine plus atorvastatin is expected to limit hs-CRP increase with resultant clinical benefits.

      This is an open-labeled parallel randomized controlled trial conducted in Accra, Ghana from November 2018 to November 2020. Participants were adult pregnant women admitted to the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) with a diagnosis of antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum eclampsia or preeclampsia with severe features, having received no more than a loading dose of magnesium sulfate prior to admission at KBTH. Participants in the standard 24-h group received a loading dose of magnesium sulfate 4 g intravenous and 10 g intramuscular (5 g in each buttock) followed by six, 5 g intramuscular maintenance doses over 24 h. Participants in the 12-h intervention group received the same loading dose followed by three, 5 g intramuscular maintenance doses over 12 h. The primary outcome was occurrence of seizure after completion of the assigned magnesium sulfate regimen. Secondary outcomes were magnesium sulfate toxicity, magnesium sulfate side effects, maternal outcomes (mode of delivery, duration of inpatient admission, duration of urethral catheterization), maternal complications (pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, intensive care unit admission, death), and neonatal outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 1176 total participants, we found no difference in occurrence of seizure after completion of the assigned regimen in the 24-h group (n = 5, 0.9%) versus the 12-h group (n = 2, 0.3%), P = 0.29; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.08, 2.04), or in occurrence of seizure any time after enrollment (n = 9, 1.5% vs. n = 5, 0.9%, P = 0.28, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19-1.64). Participants in the 12-h group had a shorter duration of inpatient admission (9.4 ± 8.8 vs. 7.7 ± 6.5 days, P = 0.0009) and urethral catheterization (2.1 ± 1.0 vs. 1.9 ± 1.3 days, P < 0.0001). Rates of side effects from magnesium sulfate were lower in the 12-h group: pain at the injection site (94.8% (n = 548) vs. 91.5% (n = 540), P = 0.03), inflammation (62.2% (n = 358) vs. 40.0% (n = 237), P < 0.0001), and bleeding or bruising at the injection site (25.1% (n = 144) vs. 14.4% (n = 85), P < 0.0001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Compared with 24 h, 12 h of intramuscular magnesium sulfate showed similar rates of seizures, with fewer side effects and shorter inpatient admission.

Rituximab in combination with cyclosporine and steroid pulse therapy for childhood-onset multidrug-resistant nephrotic syndrome: a multicenter single-arm clinical trial (JSKDC11 trial).,"Kandai Nozu, Mayumi Sako, Seiji Tanaka, Yuji Kano, Yoko Ohwada, Tamaki Morohashi, Riku Hamada, Yasufumi Ohtsuka, Masafumi Oka, Koichi Kamei, Aya Inaba, Shuichi Ito, Tomoyuki Sakai, Hiroshi Kaito, Yuko Shima, Kenji Ishikura, Hidefumi Nakamura, Koichi Nakanishi, Tomoko Horinouchi, Akihide Konishi, Takashi Omori, Kazumoto Iijima, Kandai Nozuet al.",2024 Apr,Clin Exp Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38010466/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Only 80% of children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome respond well to glucocorticoid therapy. Multidrug-resistant nephrotic syndrome (MRNS) is associated with a poor kidney prognosis. Several retrospective studies have identified rituximab as an effective treatment for MRNS; however, prospective studies are required to assess its efficacy and safety.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a multicenter, non-blinded, single-arm trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab in patients with childhood-onset MRNS who were resistant to cyclosporine and more than three courses of steroid pulse therapy. The enrolled patients received four 375 mg/m2 doses of rituximab in combination with baseline cyclosporine and steroid pulse therapy. The primary endpoint was a > 50% reduction in the urinary protein/creatinine ratio from baseline on day 169. Complete and partial remissions were also evaluated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Six patients with childhood-onset MRNS were enrolled. All patients were negative for pathogenic variants of podocyte-related genes. On day 169, five patients (83.3%) showed a > 50% reduction in the urinary protein/creatinine ratio, two patients showed partial remission, and two patients showed complete remission. No deaths occurred and severe adverse events occurred in two patients (infection in one patient and acute kidney injury in one patient). Three patients needed treatment for moderate-to-severe infection.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study treatment effectively reduced the urinary protein/creatinine ratio in patients with childhood-onset MRNS. The adverse events in this study were within the expected range; however, attention should be paid to the occurrence of infections."
Pharmacokinetics and safety of colistin sulfate after single and multiple intravenous doses in healthy Chinese subjects.,"Xiaolan Huang, Xiaofen Liu, Yaxin Fan, Yu Wang, Beining Guo, Jingjing Wang, Jicheng Yu, Qiong Wei, Xiaojie Wu, Haihui Huang, Jing Zhang, Xiaolan Huanget al.",2024 Nov,Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39276945/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      Increasing antimicrobial resistance has led to the revival of the polymyxins as a last-resort therapeutic option for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. A parenteral formulation of colistin sulfate is available solely in China. While the onset of action of IV colistin may occur faster than with its prodrug CMS, its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile remains unclear.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This single-centre, open-label, single- and multi-dose, phase 1 trial examined the PKs and safety of colistin sulfate in healthy Chinese adults. Participants received a single 10,000 units/kg (equivalent to 0.452 mg/kg) dose of colistin sulfate (single-dose group, n = 12) or the same dose q12h for 7 days (multi-dose group, n = 12) via a 2-h IV infusion. Colistin concentrations in plasma and urine were determined using LC-MS/MS, and the PK parameters calculated using non-compartmental analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After a single dose the peak concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to 12 h (AUC0-12h), terminal half-life (T1/2), volume of distribution (Vd), and total body clearance (CL) of colistin were 1.08 ± 0.18 mg/L, 4.73 ± 0.89 h·mg/L, 3.65 ± 0.55 h, 16.82 ± 2.70 L, and 3.24 ± 0.51 L/h, respectively. No accumulation of colistin was observed after multiple doses. The cumulative urinary recovery of colistin was 0.9 ± 0.7% within 24 h after multi-dose administration. No nephrotoxicity was reported.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study is the first to report colistin PKs in healthy Chinese subjects after single and multiple doses of colistin sulfate. The PK and safety data are required for optimal dose selection in clinical practice."
Safety and Efficacy of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Hormone-Derivative EA-230 in Cardiac Surgery Patients: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study.,"Roger van Groenendael, Remi Beunders, Pleun Hemelaar, Jan Hofland, Wim J Morshuis, Johannes G van der Hoeven, Jelle Gerretsen, Gert Wensvoort, Emma J Kooistra, Wout J Claassen, Denise Waanders, Maud G A Lamberts, Leonie S E Buijsse, Matthijs Kox, Lucas T van Eijk, Peter Pickkers, Roger van Groenendaelet al.",2021 May 1,Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33591006/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      To determine the safety and efficacy of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone-derivative EA-230 in cardiac surgery patients. Cardiac surgery induces systemic inflammation and may impair renal function, affecting patient outcome. EA-230 exerted immunomodulatory and renoprotective effects in preclinical models and was safe and showed efficacy in phase I and II human studies.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Collaboration of the Cardiothoracic Surgery, Anesthesiology, and the Intensive Care departments of a tertiary hospital in the Netherlands.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      One hundred eighty patients undergoing an on-pump coronary artery bypass procedure with or without concomitant valve surgery.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Ninety mg/kg/hr EA-230 or placebo administered during surgery.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      During the study, no safety concerns emerged. EA-230 did not modulate interleukin-6 plasma concentrations (area under the curve 2,730 pg/mL × hr [1,968-3,760] vs 2,680 pg/mL × hr [2,090-3,570] for EA-230 and placebo group, respectively; p = 0.80). Glomerular filtration rate increased following surgery (mean ± sem increase in the EA-230 vs placebo groups: glomerular filtration rateiohexol measured using iohexol plasma clearance: 19 ± 2 vs 16 ± 2 mL/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.13 and estimated glomerular filtration rate with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation using creatinine: 6 ± 1 vs 2 ± 1 mL/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.01). The ""injury"" stage of the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease criteria for acute kidney injury was 7% in the EA-230 group versus 18% in the placebo group (p = 0.07). In addition, EA-230-treated patients had a less positive fluid balance compared with placebo-treated patients (217 ± 108 vs 605 ± 103 mL; p = 0.01), while the use of vasoactive agents was similar in both groups (p = 0.39). Finally, hospital length of stay was shorter in EA-230 treated patients (8 d [7-11] vs 10 d [8-12]; p = 0.001). Efficacy results were more pronounced in patients that had longer duration of surgery and thus longer duration of study drug infusion.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      EA-230 was safe in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery. It did not modulate interleukin-6 plasma concentrations but appeared to exert beneficial renal and cardiovascular effects and shortened in-hospital length of stay."

      Canagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney failure and related outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial. This analysis of CREDENCE trial data examines the effect of canagliflozin on the incidence of kidney-related adverse events (AEs).
    


          Study design:
        
      
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial.
    


          Setting & participants:
        
      
      4,401 trial participants with T2DM, CKD, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio >300-5,000 mg/g.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin 100 mg/d or placebo.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      Rates of kidney-related AEs were analyzed using an on-treatment approach, overall and by screening estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) strata (30-<45, 45-<60, and 60-<90 mL/min/1.73 m2).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Canagliflozin was associated with a reduction in the overall incidence rate of kidney-related AEs (60.2 vs 84.0 per 1,000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.61-0.82]; P < 0.001), with consistent results for serious kidney-related AEs (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.51-1.00]; P = 0.05) and acute kidney injury (AKI; HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.64-1.13]; P = 0.3). The rates of kidney-related AEs were lower with canagliflozin relative to placebo across the 3 eGFR strata (HRs of 0.73, 0.60, and 0.81 for eGFR 30-<45, 45-<60, and 60-<90 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively; P = 0.3 for interaction), with similar results for AKI (P = 0.9 for interaction). Full recovery of kidney function within 30 days after an AKI event occurred more frequently with canagliflozin versus placebo (53.1% vs 35.4%; odds ratio, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.0-4.7]; P = 0.04).
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Kidney-related AEs including AKI were investigator-reported and collected without central adjudication. Biomarkers of AKI and structural tubular damage were not measured, and creatinine data after an AKI event were not available for all participants.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Compared with placebo, canagliflozin was associated with a reduced incidence of serious and nonserious kidney-related AEs in patients with T2DM and CKD. These results highlight the safety of canagliflozin with regard to adverse kidney-related AEs.

Urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin/Hepcidin-25 Ratio for Early Identification of Patients at Risk for Renal Replacement Therapy After Cardiac Surgery: A Substudy of the BICARBONATE Trial.,"Saban Elitok, Hermann Kuppe, Prasad Devarajan, Rinaldo Bellomo, Berend Isermann, Sabine Westphal, Johanna Kube, Christian Albert, Martin Ernst, Siegfried Kropf, Anja Haase-Fielitz, Michael Haase, Saban Elitoket al.",2021 Dec 1,Anesth Analg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34543256/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT) is strongly associated with mortality after cardiac surgery; however, options for early identification of patients at high risk for AKI-RRT are extremely limited. Early after cardiac surgery, the predictive ability for AKI-RRT even of one of the most extensively evaluated novel urinary biomarkers, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), appears to be only moderate. We aimed to determine whether the NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio (urinary concentrations of NGAL divided by that of hepcidin-25) early after surgery may compare favorably to NGAL for identification of high-risk patients after cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a prospective substudy of the BICARBONATE trial, a multicenter parallel-randomized controlled trial comparing perioperative bicarbonate infusion for AKI prevention to usual patient care. At a tertiary referral center, 198 patients at increased kidney risk undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were included into the present study. The primary outcome measure was defined as AKI-RRT. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and long-term mortality. We compared area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) of urinary NGAL with that of the urinary NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio within 60 minutes after end of surgery. We compared adjusted AUC and performed cross-validated reclassification statistics of the (logarithmic) urinary NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio adjusted to Cleveland risk score/EuroScore, cross-clamp time, age, volume of packed red blood cells, and (logarithmic) urinary NGAL concentration. The association of the NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio with long-term patient survival was assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis adjusting for EuroScore, aortic cross-clamp time, packed red blood cells and urinary NGAL.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients with AKI-RRT (n = 13) had 13.7-times higher NGAL and 3.3-times lower hepcidin-25 concentrations resulting in 46.9-times higher NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio early after surgery compared to patients without AKI-RRT. The NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio had higher AUC-ROC compared with NGAL for risk of AKI-RRT and in-hospital mortality (unadjusted AUC-ROC difference 0.087, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.036-0.138, P < .001; 0.082, 95% CI, 0.018-0.146, P = .012). For AKI-RRT, the NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio increased adjusted category-free net reclassification improvement (cfNRI; 0.952, 95% CI, 0.437-1.468; P < .001) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI; 0.040, 95% CI, 0.008-0.073; P = .016) but not AUC difference. For in-hospital mortality, the ratio improved AUC of the reference model (AUC difference 0.056, 95% CI, 0.003-0.108; P = .037) and cfNRI but not IDI. The urinary NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio remained significantly associated with long-term mortality after adjusting for the model covariates.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The urinary NGAL/hepcidin-25 ratio appears to early identify high-risk patients and outperform NGAL after cardiac surgery. Confirmation of our findings in other cardiac surgery centers is now needed."
Proximal tubular dysfunction in pregnant women receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus.,"Geoffroy Liegeon, Nicole Ngo-Giang-Huong, Nicolas Salvadori, Piyawan Bunpo, Ratchada Cressey, Jullapong Achalapong, Prateep Kanjanavikai, Orada Patamasingh Na Ayudhaya, Sinart Prommas, Thitiporn Siriwachirachai, Prapan Sabsanong, Jean Yves Mary, Gonzague Jourdain, Geoffroy Liegeonet al.",2022 Mar 31,J Antimicrob Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35045168/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Data evaluating the risk of proximal tubular dysfunction in women receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HBV are scarce.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the risk of proximal tubulopathy in pregnant women receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for PMTCT of HBV.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      We used urine samples collected from HBV monoinfected pregnant women who participated in a Phase III, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing a tenofovir disoproxil fumarate short course from 28 weeks gestational age (28-wk-GA) to 2 months post-partum (2-months-PP) for PMTCT of HBV in Thailand. Markers of tubular dysfunction, including retinol binding protein, kidney injury molecule-1, α1-microglobuin and β2-microglobulin, were assayed at 28- and 32-wk-GA and 2-months-PP visits. Proximal tubulopathy was defined as the presence of ≥2 of the following: tubular proteinuria, euglycaemic glycosuria and increased urinary phosphate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 291 women participated in the study. No kidney-related adverse events were severe, and none led to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate discontinuation. At 2-months-PP, 3 of the 120 (3%) evaluated women in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group experienced proximal tubulopathy versus 3 of 125 (2%) in the placebo group (P = 1.00). None of the six women met the criteria for proximal tubulopathy at 12-months-PP but proteinuria persisted in three of them. No growth abnormalities were found at 1 year of age in infants born to mothers with proximal tubulopathy at 2-months-PP.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In these HBV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate administered from 28-wk-GA to 2-months-PP was not associated with a higher risk of proximal tubulopathy."

      In the COVERT-MI randomised placebo-controlled trial, oral administration of high-dose colchicine at the time of reperfusion and for 5 days in acute ST-elevated myocardial infarction did not reduce infarct size but was associated with a significant increase in left ventricular thrombus (LVT) in comparison to placebo. We aimed to assess the 1-year clinical outcomes of the study population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study is a follow-up analysis of the COVERT-MI study on prespecified secondary clinical endpoints at 1 year. The primary endpoint of this study was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including all-cause death, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure events, ischaemic strokes, sustained ventricular arrhythmias and acute kidney injury at 1-year follow-up. The quality of life (QOL) and the drug therapy prescription were also assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At 1 year, 192 patients (101 patients in the colchicine group, 91 in the placebo group) were followed up. Seventy-six (39.6%) MACEs were reported in the study population. There was no significant difference regarding the number of MACEs between groups: 36 (35.6%) in the colchicine group and 40 (44.1%) in the placebo group (p=0.3). There were no differences in the occurrence of ischaemic strokes between the colchicine group and the control group (3 (3%) vs 2 (2.2%), respectively, p=0.99). There was a trend towards fewer heart failure events in the colchicine group compared with the placebo group (12 (11.9%) vs 18 (19.8%), p=0.20). There was no significant difference in QOL scores at 1 year (75.8±15.7 vs 72.7±16.2 respectively, p=0.18).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There was no significant difference between the colchicine and placebo groups at 1 year regarding MACEs, especially concerning deaths or ischaemic strokes. No excess of ischaemic adverse events was observed despite the initial increase in LVT in the colchicine group.

      We attempted to explore the effect of Dex on renal function in patients with cardiac valve replacement under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
    


          Design:
        
      
      We designed a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center, parallel-arm double-blind trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Operating room.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Seven-two eligible patients were randomly divided into Dex group and placebo group.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Dexmedetomidine (Dex) (0.6μg·kg-1) was administered in patients of Dex group at 15min before anesthesia induction, followed by a treatment of 0.2μg·kg-1·h-1 Dex until the end of operation. Patients in placebo group were treated with normal saline equally.
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      The levels of serum urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), urine interleukin-8 (IL-18) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were tested before anesthesia induction (T1) and after operation at 0, 12h, 24h and 72h (T2-5).

      Dex may attenuate the renal injury and decrease the incidence of AKI in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement under CPB."
"Initiation of the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin to prevent kidney and heart failure outcomes guided by HbA1c, albuminuria, and predicted risk of kidney failure.","Sok Cin Tye, Niels Jongs, Steven G Coca, Johan Sundström, Clare Arnott, Bruce Neal, Vlado Perkovic, Kenneth W Mahaffey, Priya Vart, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Sok Cin Tyeet al.",2022 Sep 23,Cardiovasc Diabetol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36151557/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of kidney and heart failure events independent of glycemic effects. We assessed whether initiation of the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin guided by multivariable predicted risk based on clinical characteristics and novel biomarkers is more efficient to prevent clinical outcomes compared to a strategy guided by HbA1c or urinary-albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) alone.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a post-hoc analysis of the CANVAS trial including 3713 patients with available biomarker measurements. We compared the number of composite kidney (defined as a sustained 40% decline in eGFR, chronic dialysis, kidney transplantation, or kidney death) and composite heart failure outcomes (defined as heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular (CV) death) prevented per 1000 patients treated for 5 years when canagliflozin was initiated in patients according to HbA1c ≥ 7.5%, UACR, or multivariable risk models consisting of: (1) clinical characteristics, or (2) clinical characteristics and novel biomarkers. Differences in the rates of events prevented between strategies were tested by Chi2-statistic.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After a median follow-up of 6.1 years, 144 kidney events were recorded. The final clinical model included age, previous history of CV disease, systolic blood pressure, UACR, hemoglobin, body weight, albumin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and randomized treatment assignment. The combined biomarkers model included all clinical characteristics, tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, kidney injury molecule-1, matrix metallopeptidase-7 and interleukin-6. Treating all patients with HbA1c ≥ 7.5% (n = 2809) would prevent 33.0 (95% CI 18.8 to 43.3 ) kidney events at a rate of 9.6 (95% CI 5.5 to 12.6) events prevented per 1000 patients treated for 5 years. The corresponding rates were 5.8 (95% CI 3.4 to 7.9), 16.6 (95% CI 9.5 to 22.0) (P < 0.001 versus HbA1c or UACR approach), and 17.5 (95% CI 10.0 to 23.0) (P < 0.001 versus HbA1c or UACR approach; P = 0.54 versus clinical model). Findings were similar for the heart failure outcome.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Initiation of canagliflozin based on an estimated risk-based approach prevented more kidney and heart failure outcomes compared to a strategy based on HbA1c or UACR alone. There was no apparent gain from adding novel biomarkers to the clinical risk model. These findings support the use of risk-based assessment using clinical markers to guide initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes."
Effects of Hydrochlorothiazide and Metformin on Aquaresis and Nephroprotection by a Vasopressin V2 Receptor Antagonist in ADPKD: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,"Bart J Kramers, Iris W Koorevaar, Maatje D A van Gastel, Harry van Goor, Kenneth R Hallows, Hiddo L Heerspink, Hui Li, Wouter N Leonhard, Dorien J M Peters, Jiedong Qiu, Daan J Touw, Ron T Gansevoort, Esther Meijer, Bart J Kramerset al.",2022 Apr,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35314480/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      The vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan is the only drug that has been proven to be nephroprotective in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Tolvaptan also causes polyuria, limiting tolerability. We hypothesized that cotreatment with hydrochlorothiazide or metformin may ameliorate this side effect.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      We performed a clinical study and an animal study. In a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover trial, we included 13 tolvaptan-treated patients with ADPKD. Patients were treated for three 2-week periods with hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, or placebo in random order. Primary outcome was change in 24-hour urine volume. We also measured GFR and a range of metabolic and kidney injury markers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients (age 45±8 years, 54% women, measured GFR of 55±11 ml/min per 1.73 m2) had a baseline urine volume on tolvaptan of 6.9±1.4 L/24 h. Urine volume decreased to 5.1 L/24 h (P<0.001) with hydrochlorothiazide and to 5.4 L/24 h (P<0.001) on metformin. During hydrochlorothiazide treatment, plasma copeptin (surrogate for vasopressin) decreased, quality of life improved, and several markers of kidney damage and glucose metabolism improved. Metformin did not induce changes in these markers or in quality of life. Given these results, the effect of adding hydrochlorothiazide to tolvaptan was investigated on long-term kidney outcome in an animal experiment. Water intake in tolvaptan-hydrochlorothiazide cotreated mice was 35% lower than in mice treated with tolvaptan only. Combination treatment was superior to ""no treatment"" on markers of disease progression (kidney weight, P=0.003 and cystic index, P=0.04) and superior or equal to tolvaptan alone.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Both metformin and hydrochlorothiazide reduced tolvaptan-caused polyuria in a short-term study. Hydrochlorothiazide also reduced polyuria in a long-term animal model without negatively affecting nephroprotection.

Importance of intraoperative oliguria during major abdominal surgery: findings of the Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery trial.,"Paul S Myles, David R McIlroy, Rinaldo Bellomo, Sophie Wallace, Paul S Myleset al.",2019 Jun,Br J Anaesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30916001/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The association between intraoperative oliguria during major abdominal surgery and the subsequent development of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) remains poorly defined. We hypothesised that, in such patients, intraoperative oliguria would be an independent predictor of subsequent AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a post hoc analysis of data from the Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery (RELIEF) trial of conservative vs liberal fluid therapy during and after major abdominal surgery. We used χ2, logistic regression, and fractional polynomials to study the association between intraoperative oliguria defined as a urinary output <0.5 ml kg-1 h-1 and the development of postoperative AKI defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes consensus criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We included 2444 of 2983 patients from the RELIEF trial in this study. A total of 889 patients (36%) met oliguric criteria intraoperatively. Oliguria occurred in 35% of those without AKI, and 44%, 48%, and 45% of those who developed postoperative AKI Stages 1-3, respectively (P<0.001 for trend). Intraoperative oliguria was associated with an increased risk of AKI, risk ratio: 1.38 (95% confidence interval: 1.14-1.44; P<0.001), but greater intensity of oliguria (urine output <0.3 ml kg-1 h-1) did not increase this risk further. Most patients with oliguria did not develop AKI; the positive predictive value of oliguria was 25.5%, and the negative predictive value was 81.6%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intraoperative oliguria, defined as urine output <0.5 ml kg-1 h-1, was relatively common and was associated with postoperative AKI. However, the predictive utility of oliguria for AKI was low, whilst its absence had a good predictive value for an AKI-free postoperative course.

Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists in Patients With Heart Failure and Impaired Renal Function.,"Shingo Matsumoto, Alasdair D Henderson, Li Shen, Mingming Yang, Karl Swedberg, Muthiah Vaduganathan, Dirk J van Veldhuisen, Scott D Solomon, Bertram Pitt, Faiez Zannad, Pardeep S Jhund, John J V McMurray, Shingo Matsumotoet al.",2024 Jun 18,J Am Coll Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38739064/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Kidney dysfunction often leads to reluctance to start or continue life-saving heart failure (HF) therapy.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study sought to examine the efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction experiencing significant kidney dysfunction.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We pooled individual patient data from the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) and EMPHASIS-HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure) trials. The association between MRA treatment and outcomes was assessed according to whether the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declined to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or not. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 4,355 patients included, 295 (6.8%) experienced a deterioration of eGFR after randomization to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. These patients had more impaired baseline cardiac and kidney function (eGFR 47.3 ± 13.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 70.5 ± 21.8 mL/min/1.73 m2) and had a higher risk of the primary outcome than patients without eGFR deterioration (HR: 2.49; 95% CI: 2.01-3.08; P < 0.001). However, the risk reduction in the primary outcome with MRA therapy was similar in those who experienced a decrease in eGFR to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.43-0.99) compared with those who did not (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.56-0.71) (Pinteraction = 0.87). In patients with a decrease in eGFR to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, 21 fewer individuals (per 100 person-years) experienced the primary outcome with MRA treatment, vs placebo, compared with an excess of 3 more patients with severe hyperkalemia (>6.0 mmol/L).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Because patients experiencing a decrease in eGFR to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 are at very high risk, the absolute risk reduction with an MRA in these patients is large and this decline in eGFR should not automatically lead to treatment discontinuation."
Effects of dexmedetomidine on renal function after cardiac surgery for infective endocarditis: An interim analysis of a randomized controlled trial.,"Sung Yeon Ham, Jae-Kwang Shim, Sak Lee, Seo Hee Ko, Sarah Soh, Young-Lan Kwak, Sung Yeon Hamet al.",2024 Oct,Asian J Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38658274/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery for infective endocarditis (IE) are at a high risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) owing to heightened systemic inflammation. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative AKI in patients who underwent cardiac surgery for IE.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 63 patients who underwent cardiac surgery for IE were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion of 0.4 μg kg-1 h-1 (DEX group) or normal saline infusion (control group) for 24 h after induction of anesthesia. The occurrence of AKI within seven days postoperation, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and interleukin-6 levels, as well as postoperative morbidities, were assessed. An intertrim analysis was conducted using Pocock's alpha spending function at α = 0.05 and β = 0.2.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This trial was early terminated according to the results of interim analysis performed when 60 % of the pre-set number of patients have been collected. The incidence of AKI was significantly lower in the DEX group than in the control group (32.3 % vs. 9.4 %, p = 0.025). Patients in the DEX group had significantly lower epinephrine levels than those in the control group, whereas norepinephrine and interleukin-6 levels were similar. Perioperative mean arterial pressure or heart rate did not differ between the groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dexmedetomidine administration for 24 h starting from induction of anesthesia significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative AKI after cardiac surgery for IE (by 29 % vs. control) without hemodynamic side effects. This was accompanied by a significant attenuation of postoperative increase in serum epinephrine levels."

Patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) often do not achieve LDL-C targets despite potent statin treatment, and have a particularly high risk of early recurrent events. Evolocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type (PCSK9)-inhibitor resulting in rapid, marked LDL-C reduction, has been studied in hypercholesterolemic subjects without CVD and stabilized patients with CVD; the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this treatment initiated in the acute phase of ACS remain unknown. We report the design of evolocumab for early reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels in patients with ACS (EVOPACS), a phase-3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the feasibility, safety, and LDL-C-lowering efficacy of evolocumab on top of atorvastatin 40 mg in patients with ACS. The primary endpoint is percent change in LDL-C from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints are adverse events and serious adverse events. Against a background of beneficial cardiovascular effects of statins beyond LDL-C lowering and in view of preclinical evidence of similar effects of PCSK9 inhibition, the study will also address a variety of exploratory endpoints including the change in C-reactive protein and other inflammatory biomarkers; platelet reactivity; and occurrence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury and myocardial injury in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. An intracoronary imaging sub-study will investigate the change from baseline in the lipid core burden index in non-culprit lesions, as assessed by serial near-infrared spectroscopy.

Effect of YH0618 soup on chemotherapy-induced toxicity in patients with cancer who have completed chemotherapy: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Jie-Shu You, Jian-Ping Chen, Jessie S M Chan, Ho-Fun Lee, Mei-Kuen Wong, Wing-Fai Yeung, Li-Xing Lao, Jie-Shu Youet al.",2016 Jul 26,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27457560/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The incidence of cancer has been staying at a high level worldwide in recent years. With advances in cancer diagnosis and therapy strategy, the survival rate of patients with cancer has been increasing, but the side effects of these treatments, especially chemotherapy, are obvious even when the chemotherapy ceases. YH0618, a prescription, has showed efficacy in reducing chemotherapy-induced toxicity through long clinical practice. However, there is no scientific research exploring the effects of YH0618 in patients with cancer. Therefore, using a randomized controlled trial, this study will explore the efficacy of YH0618 on ameliorating chemotherapy-induced toxicity including dermatologic toxicity, myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity and improving fatigue in cancer patients who have completed chemotherapy.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      This is a prospective assessor-blinded, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Patients with cancer at any stage who have completed chemotherapy within two weeks will be randomly divided into group A (YH0618) and group B (wait-list) using a 1:1 allocation ratio. The chemotherapeutic agents include taxanes or anthracyclines. Subjects assigned to group A will receive YH0618 soup 6 days a week for 6 weeks and uncontrolled follow-up for 6 weeks, while group B are required to wait for 6 weeks before receiving YH0618 intervention. The primary outcome of this study is the incidence of protocol-specified grade ≥2 dermatologic toxicities graded by NCI CTCAE Chinese version 4.0 and changes of fingernail color, face skin color and tongue color evaluated by the L*a*b system within 6 weeks. There are some secondary outcomes associated with dermatologic toxicity including fatigue and clinical objective examination.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      There are few scientific and safe methods in ameliorating chemotherapy-induced toxicity. The proposed study may provide direct and convincing evidence to support YH0618 as an adjuvant treatment for reducing chemotherapy-induced toxicity, which could be introduced into clinical settings.

Cardiac and kidney benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure across the spectrum of kidney function: Insights from the EMPEROR-Preserved trial.,"Abhinav Sharma, João Pedro Ferreira, Faiez Zannad, Stuart J Pocock, Gerasimos Filippatos, Egon Pfarr, Michaela Petrini, Bettina J Kraus, Christoph Wanner, Milton Packer, Javed Butler, Stefan D Anker, Abhinav Sharmaet al.",2023 Aug,Eur J Heart Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37062851/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      In the EMPEROR-Preserved trial, empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes of patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction. In this pre-specified analysis, we aim to study the effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across the spectrum of kidney function.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Patients were categorized by the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline (CKD defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or urine albumin to creatinine ratio >300 mg/g). The primary and key secondary outcomes were (i) a composite of cardiovascular death or first HF hospitalization (primary outcome); (ii) total number of HF hospitalization, (iii) eGFR slope; and a pre-specified exploratory composite kidney outcome including a sustained ≥40% decline in eGFR, chronic dialysis or renal transplant. The median follow-up was 26.2 months. A total of 5988 patients were randomized to empagliflozin or placebo, of whom 3198 (53.5%) had CKD. Irrespective of CKD status, empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome (with CKD: hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.94; without CKD: HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95; interaction p = 0.67) and total (first and recurrent) hospitalizations for HF (with CKD: HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54-0.86; without CKD: HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66-1.21; interaction p = 0.17). Empagliflozin slowed the slope of eGFR decline by 1.43 (1.01-1.85) ml/min/1.73 m2 /year in patients with CKD and 1.31 (0.88-1.74) ml/min/1.73 m2 /year in patients without CKD (interaction p = 0.70). Empagliflozin did not reduce the pre-specified kidney outcome in patients with or without CKD (with CKD: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71-1.34; without CKD: HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.58-1.48; interaction p = 0.86) but slowed progression to macroalbuminuria and reduced the risk of acute kidney injury. The effect of empagliflozin on the primary composite outcome and the key secondary outcomes was consistent across five baseline eGFR categories (all interaction p >0.05). Empagliflozin was well tolerated independent of CKD status.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In EMPEROR-Preserved, empagliflozin had a beneficial effect on the key efficacy outcomes in patients with and without CKD. Overall, the benefit and safety of empagliflozin was consistent across a wide range of kidney function spectrum, down to a baseline eGFR of 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 ."

      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention is a common iatrogenic complication associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study compares sodium bicarbonate/isotonic saline/N-acetylcysteine/vitamin C prophylaxis (BS-NAC) against high-volume forced diuresis with matched hydration in CIAKI prevention.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One-hundred and thirty-three consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73m were randomized to the study group receiving matched hydration (MHG) or to the control group receiving BS-NAC. MHG received in vein (i.v.) 250 mL isotonic saline bolus, followed by a 0.5 mg/kg furosemide i.v. bolus to forced diuresis. A dedicated device automatically matched the isotonic saline i.v. infusion rate to the urinary output for 1 h before, during and 4 h after the procedure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      MHG had the lowest incidence of CIAKI (7 vs. 25%, P = 0.01), major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 1 year (7 vs. 32%, P < 0.01) and readmissions to cardiology/nephrology departments (8 vs. 25%, P = 0.03; hospitalization days 1.0 ± 3.8 vs. 4.9 ± 12.5, P = 0.01). Three months after the procedure the decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 0.02% for MHG versus 15% for the control group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Matched hydration was more effective than BS-NAC in CIAKI prevention. One-year follow-up showed that matched hydration was associated also with limited chronic kidney disease progression, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and hospitalizations."
"The NRF2 stimulating agent, tin protoporphyrin, activates protective cytokine pathways in healthy human subjects and in patients with chronic kidney disease.","Richard A Zager, Ali C M Johnson, Richard A Zageret al.",2020 Sep,Physiol Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32940965/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), a heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) inhibitor, triggers adaptive tissue responses that confer potent protection against acute renal- and extra-renal tissue injuries. This effect is mediated, in part, via SnPP-induced activation of the cytoprotective Nrf2 pathway. However, it remains unclear as to whether SnPP can also upregulate humoral cytokine defenses, either in healthy human subjects or in patients with CKD. If so, then systemically derived cytokines could contribute SnPP-induced tissue protection.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      SnPP (90 mg IV) was administered over 2 hr to six healthy human volunteers (HVs) and 12 subjects with stage 3-4 CKD. Plasma samples were obtained from baseline upto 72 hr post injection. Two representative anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGFβ1), and a pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α), were assayed. Because IL-6 has been shown to induce tissue preconditioning, its plasma concentrations were also assessed. In complementary mouse experiments, SnPP effects on renal, splenic, and hepatic IL-10, IL-6, TGFβ1, and TNF-α production (as gauged by their mRNAs) were tested. Tissue HO-1 mRNA served as an Nrf2 activation marker.
    


          Results:
        
      
      SnPP induced marked (~5-7x) increases in plasma IL-10 and IL-6 concentrations within 24-48 hr, and to equal degrees in HVs and CKD patients. SnPP modestly raised plasma TGFβ1 without impacting plasma TNF-α levels. In mouse experiments, SnPP did not affect IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, or TGFβ1 mRNAs in kidney despite marked renal Nrf2 activation. Conversely, SnPP increased splenic IL-10 and hepatic IL-6/TGFβ1 mRNA levels, suggesting these organs as sites of extra-renal cytokine generation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      SnPP can trigger cytoprotective cytokine production, most likely in extra-renal tissues. With ready glomerular cytokine filtration, extra-renal/renal ""organ cross talk"" can result. Thus, humoral factors seemingly can contribute to SnPP's cytoprotective effects."
Low Versus Standard Urine Output Targets in Patients Undergoing Major Abdominal Surgery: A Randomized Noninferiority Trial.,"Jevon R Puckett, John W Pickering, Suetonia C Palmer, John L McCall, Michal T Kluger, Janak De Zoysa, Zoltan H Endre, Mattias Soop, Jevon R Puckettet al.",2017 May,Ann Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27763895/,No keywords found,"Objective:

      A minimum hourly urine output of 0.5 mL/kg is a key target guiding perioperative fluid therapy. Few data support this standard practice, which may contribute to perioperative fluid overloading.

Maintenance fluids were standardized and additional fluids administered to achieve the targets. Primary outcome was noninferiority for urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin on the day after surgery.

      Between November 21, 2011 and July 11, 2013, 40 participants completed the study. The low group received 3170 mL (95% confidence interval 2380-3960) intravenous fluids versus 5490 mL (95% confidence interval 4570-6410) in the standard group (P = 0.0004), and was noninferior for neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [14.7 μg/L (interquartile range 7.60-28.9) vs 18.4 μg/L (interquartile range 8.30-21.2); Pnoninferiority = 0.0011], serum cystatin C (Pnoninferiority < 0.0001), serum creatinine (Pnoninferiority = 0.0004), and measured glomerular filtration (Pnoninferiority = 0.0003). Effective renal plasma flow increased in both groups after surgery, and more in the standard group (Pnoninferiority = 0.125).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A perioperative urine output target of 0.2 mL/kg/h is noninferior to the standard target of 0.5 mL/kg/h and results in a large intravenous fluid sparing. This target should be adopted in surgical patients without significant kidney injury risk factors."
Randomized Controlled Trial of Intensive Versus Conservative Glucose Control in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery: GLUCO-CABG Trial.,"Guillermo Umpierrez, Saumeth Cardona, Francisco Pasquel, Sol Jacobs, Limin Peng, Michael Unigwe, Christopher A Newton, Dawn Smiley-Byrd, Priyathama Vellanki, Michael Halkos, John D Puskas, Robert A Guyton, Vinod H Thourani, Guillermo Umpierrezet al.",2015 Sep,Diabetes Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26180108/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      The optimal level of glycemic control needed to improve outcomes in cardiac surgery patients remains controversial.
    


          Research design and methods:
        
      
      We randomized patients with diabetes (n = 152) and without diabetes (n = 150) with hyperglycemia to an intensive glucose target of 100-140 mg/dL (n = 151) or to a conservative target of 141-180 mg/dL (n = 151) after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) surgery. After the intensive care unit (ICU), patients received a single treatment regimen in the hospital and 90 days postdischarge. Primary outcome was differences in a composite of complications, including mortality, wound infection, pneumonia, bacteremia, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and major cardiovascular events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean glucose in the ICU was 132 ± 14 mg/dL (interquartile range [IQR] 124-139) in the intensive and 154 ± 17 mg/dL (IQR 142-164) in the conservative group (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the composite of complications between intensive and conservative groups (42 vs. 52%, P = 0.08). We observed heterogeneity in treatment effect according to diabetes status, with no differences in complications among patients with diabetes treated with intensive or conservative regimens (49 vs. 48%, P = 0.87), but a significant lower rate of complications in patients without diabetes treated with intensive compared with conservative treatment regimen (34 vs. 55%, P = 0.008).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intensive insulin therapy to target glucose of 100 and 140 mg/dL in the ICU did not significantly reduce perioperative complications compared with target glucose of 141 and 180 mg/dL after CABG surgery. Subgroup analysis showed a lower number of complications in patients without diabetes, but not in patients with diabetes treated with the intensive regimen. Large prospective randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings."
Prognostic Significance of Hyperuricemia in Patients With Acute Heart Failure.,"Alberto Palazzuoli, Gaetano Ruocco, Marco Pellegrini, Matteo Beltrami, Nicola Giordano, Ranuccio Nuti, Peter A McCullough, Alberto Palazzuoliet al.",2016 May 15,Am J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27040576/,No keywords found,"Serum uric acid (UA) is associated with death and hospitalization in chronic heart failure (HF). However, UA in acute HF has not been well studied with respect to its relation to renal dysfunction and vascular congestion. We measured admission serum UA along with baseline variables in 281 patients with acute HF screened from the Loop Diuretics Administration and Acute Heart Failure (Diur-HF) trial. Hyperuricemia was defined as serum UA >7 mg/dl in men and >6 mg/dl in women. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) before hospital admission. Death or HF hospitalization at 6 months was the primary outcome. The mean UA concentration was 6.4 ± 2.5 mg/dl, and 121 patients (43.1%) were classified as hyperuricemic. UA values were significantly increased in patients with CKD compared to patients without CKD (6.8 ± 2.7 vs 6.1 ± 2.1 mg/dl; p = 0.02); however, UA was not associated with the development of acute kidney injury. Patients with hyperuricemia had greater degrees of pulmonary and systemic congestion than normouricemic patients (congestion score 3.5 vs 2.1, p <0.01). Hyperuricemia was associated with higher risk of death or HF rehospitalization (univariate hazard ratio 1.46 [1.02 to 2.10]; p = 0.04, multivariate hazard ratio 1.69 [1.16 to 2.45]; p = 0.005). In conclusion, hospitalized patients with acute HF, elevated UA levels were associated with both CKD and pulmonary congestion. After controlling for potential confounders, hyperuricemia was associated with rehospitalization and death at 6 months."
A phase 1 study of azacitidine with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in high-risk acute myeloid leukemia.,"Kirk E Cahill, Yasmin H Karimi, Theodore G Karrison, Nitin Jain, Margaret Green, Howard Weiner, Noreen Fulton, Sabah Kadri, Lucy A Godley, Andrew S Artz, Hongtao Liu, Michael J Thirman, Michelle M Le Beau, Megan E McNerney, Jeremy Segal, Richard A Larson, Wendy Stock, Olatoyosi Odenike, Kirk E Cahillet al.",2020 Feb 25,Blood Adv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32074275/,No keywords found,"In this phase 1 study, azacitidine (AZA) was given before high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) and mitoxantrone (mito) based on the hypothesis that epigenetic priming with a hypomethylating agent before cytotoxic chemotherapy would improve response rates in patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including relapsed/refractory disease. The primary objective was to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of AZA given before standard HiDAC/mito. In a dose escalation scheme, 46 patients (median age, 66 years) received AZA at 37.5, 50, or 75 mg/m2 subcutaneously or IV once daily on days 1 to 5 followed by HiDAC (3000 mg/m2) and mitoxantrone (30 mg/m2) once each on days 6 and 10 (the HiDAC/mito dose was reduced 33% in elderly subjects). Two dose-limiting toxicities occurred (both in the same patient): acute liver failure and kidney injury at the 50 mg/m2 dose. The 30-day induction death rate was 2.2% (1 of 46). The overall response rate, including complete remission and complete remission with incomplete count recovery, was 61% (28 of 46). Previously untreated patients aged ≥60 years with therapy-related AML and de novo AML were more likely to respond than untreated patients with AML progressing from an antecedent hematologic disorder (myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). Patients with favorable European Leukemia Network risk (P = .008), NPM1 mutations (P = .007), or IDH2 mutations (P = .03) were more likely to respond, and those with TP53 mutations (P = .03) were less likely to respond. The recommended phase 2 dose of AZA is 75 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 5 followed by HiDAC (3000 mg/m2) and mitoxantrone (30 mg/m2) once each on days 6 and 10.

A pre-specified analysis of the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) randomized controlled trial on the incidence of abrupt declines in kidney function.,"Hiddo J L Heerspink, David Cherney, Douwe Postmus, Bergur V Stefánsson, Glenn M Chertow, Jamie P Dwyer, Tom Greene, Mikhail Kosiborod, Anna Maria Langkilde, John J V McMurray, Ricardo Correa-Rotter, Peter Rossing, C David Sjöström, Robert D Toto, David C Wheeler                              ;, DAPA-CKD Trial Committees and Investigators, Hiddo J L Heerspinket al.",2022 Jan,Kidney Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34560136/,"SGLT2 inhibitors, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, dapagliflozin.","This pre-specified analysis of DAPA-CKD assessed the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition on abrupt declines in kidney function in high-risk patients based on having chronic kidney disease (CKD) and substantial albuminuria. DAPA-CKD was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that had a median follow-up of 2.4 years. Adults with CKD (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 200-5000 mg/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate 25-75 mL/min/1.73m2) were randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg/day matched to placebo (2152 individuals each). An abrupt decline in kidney function was defined as a pre-specified endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine between two subsequent study visits. We also assessed a post-hoc analysis of investigator-reported acute kidney injury-related serious adverse events. Doubling of serum creatinine between two subsequent visits (median time-interval 100 days) occurred in 63 (2.9%) and 91 (4.2%) participants in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio 0.68 [95% confidence interval 0.49, 0.94]). Accounting for the competing risk of mortality did not alter our findings. There was no heterogeneity in the effect of dapagliflozin on abrupt declines in kidney function based on baseline subgroups. Acute kidney injury-related serious adverse events were not significantly different and occurred in 52 (2.5%) and 69 (3.2%) participants in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (0.77 [0.54, 1.10]). Thus, in patients with CKD and substantial albuminuria, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of abrupt declines in kidney function."
Rogaratinib in patients with advanced cancers selected by FGFR mRNA expression: a phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study.,"Martin Schuler, Byoung Chul Cho, Cyrus Michael Sayehli, Alejandro Navarro, Ross A Soo, Heike Richly, Philippe Alexandre Cassier, David Tai, Nicolas Penel, Lucia Nogova, Se Hoon Park, Martin Schostak, Pablo Gajate, Richard Cathomas, Prabhu Rajagopalan, Joachim Grevel, Sebastian Bender, Oliver Boix, Hendrik Nogai, Matthias Ocker, Peter Ellinghaus, Markus Joerger, Martin Schuleret al.",2019 Oct,Lancet Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31405822/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The clinical activity of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors seems restricted to cancers harbouring rare FGFR genetic aberrations. In preclinical studies, high tumour FGFR mRNA expression predicted response to rogaratinib, an oral pan-FGFR inhibitor. We aimed to assess the safety, maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary clinical activity of rogaratinib.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We did a phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of rogaratinib in adults with advanced cancers at 22 sites in Germany, Switzerland, South Korea, Singapore, Spain, and France. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and were ineligible for standard therapy, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, a life expectancy of at least 3 months, and at least one measurable or evaluable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. During dose escalation, rogaratinib was administered orally twice daily at 50-800 mg in continuous 21-day cycles using a model-based dose-response analysis (continuous reassessment method). In the dose-expansion phase, all patients provided an archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour biopsy or consented to a new biopsy at screening for the analysis of FGFR1-3 mRNA expression. In the dose-expansion phase, rogaratinib was given at the recommended dose for expansion to patients in four cohorts: urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous-cell cancer (HNSCC), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and other solid tumour types. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, determination of maximum tolerated dose including dose-limiting toxicities and determination of recommended phase 2 dose, and pharmacokinetics of rogaratinib. Safety analyses were reported in all patients who received at least one dose of rogaratinib. Patients who completed cycle 1 or discontinued during cycle 1 due to an adverse event or dose-limiting toxicity were included in the evaluation of recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy analyses were reported for all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and who had available post-baseline efficacy data. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01976741, and is fully recruited.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Dec 30, 2013, and July 5, 2017, 866 patients were screened for FGFR mRNA expression, of whom 126 patients were treated (23 FGFR mRNA-unselected patients in the dose-escalation phase and 103 patients with FGFR mRNA-overexpressing tumours [52 patients with urothelial carcinoma, eight patients with HNSCC, 20 patients with NSCLC, and 23 patients with other tumour types] in the dose-expansion phase). No dose-limiting toxicities were reported and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached; 800 mg twice daily was established as the recommended phase 2 dose and was selected for the dose-expansion phase. The most common adverse events of any grade were hyperphosphataemia (in 77 [61%] of 126 patients), diarrhoea (in 65 [52%]), and decreased appetite (in 48 [38%]); and the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were fatigue (in 11 [9%] of 126 patients) and asymptomatic increased lipase (in 10 [8%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in five patients (decreased appetite and diarrhoea in one patient with urothelial carcinoma, and acute kidney injury [NSCLC], hypoglycaemia [other solid tumours], retinopathy [urothelial carcinoma], and vomiting [urothelial carcinoma] in one patient each); no treatment-related deaths occurred. Median follow-up after cessation of treatment was 32 days (IQR 25-36 days). In the expansion cohorts, 15 (15%; 95% CI 8·6-23·5) out of 100 evaluable patients achieved an objective response, with responses recorded in all four expansion cohorts (12 in the urothelial carcinoma cohort and one in each of the other three cohorts), and in ten (67%) of 15 FGFR mRNA-overexpressing tumours without apparent FGFR genetic aberration.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Rogaratinib was well tolerated and clinically active against several types of cancer. Selection by FGFR mRNA expression could be a useful additional biomarker to identify a broader patient population who could be eligible for FGFR inhibitor treatment.

"Effect of 0.9% NaCl compared to plasma-lyte on biomarkers of kidney injury, sodium excretion and tubular transport proteins in patients undergoing primary uncemented hip replacement - a randomized trial.","A M Østergaard, A N Jørgensen, S Bøvling, N P Ekeløf, F H Mose, J N Bech, A M Østergaardet al.",2021 Mar 26,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33771116/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Isotonic saline (IS) is widely used to secure perioperative cardiovascular stability. However, the high amount of chloride in IS can induce hyperchloremic acidosis. Therefore, IS is suspected to increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Biomarkers may have potential as indicators.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 38 patients undergoing primary uncemented hip replacement were randomized to IS or PlasmaLyte (PL). Infusion was given during surgery as 15 ml/kg the first hour and 5 ml/kg the following two hours. Urinary samples were collected upon admission and the day after surgery. As surgery was initiated, urine was collected over the course of 4 h. Hereafter, another urine collection proceeded until the morning. Urine was analyzed for markers of AKI neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). Arterious and venous blood samples for measurements of pH and plasma electrolytes including chloride (p-Cl) were collected as surgery was initiated, at the end of surgery and the following morning.
    


          Results:
        
      
      IS induced an increase in p-Cl (111 ± 2 mmol/L after IS and 108 ± 3 after PL, p = 0.004) and a decrease in pH (7.39 ± 0.02 after IS and 7.43 ± 0.03 after PL, p = 0.001). Urinary NGAL excretion increased in both groups (ΔNGAL: 5.5 [4.1; 11.7] μg/mmol creatinine p = 0.004 after IS vs. 5.5 [2.1;9.4] μg/mmol creatinine after PL, p < 0.001). No difference was found between the groups (p = 0.839). Similarly, urinary KIM-1 excretion increased in both groups (ΔKIM-1: IS 115.8 [74.1; 156.2] ng/mmol creatinine, p < 0.001 vs. PL 152.4 [120.1; 307.9] ng/mmol creatinine, p < 0.001). No difference between the groups (p = 0.064). FENa increased (1.08 ± 0.52% after IS and 1.66 ± 1.15% after PL, p = 0.032). ENaC excretion was different within groups (p = 0.019).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A significantly higher plasma chloride and a lower pH was present in the group receiving isotonic saline. However, u-NGAL and u-KIM-1 increased significantly in both groups after surgery despite absence of changes in creatinine. These results indicate that surgery induced subclinical kidney injury. Also, the IS group had a delayed sodium excretion as compared to the PL group which may indicate that IS affects renal sodium excretion differently from PL.

A randomized phase 2B trial of vancomycin versus daptomycin for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia due to isolates with high vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations - results of a prematurely terminated study.,"Shirin Kalimuddin, Yvonne F Z Chan, Rachel Phillips, Siew Pei Ong, Sophia Archuleta, David Chien Lye, Thuan Tong Tan, Jenny G H Low, Shirin Kalimuddinet al.",2018 Jun 1,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29859132/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Studies have suggested the reduced effectiveness of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections with high vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations. Alternative agents such as daptomycin may be considered. We conducted a randomized controlled study comparing daptomycin against vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA bloodstream infections with high vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients were randomized to receive vancomycin or daptomycin for a minimum of 14 days. The primary end point was the rate of all-cause mortality at day 60.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 14 patients were randomized in this study, with 7 patients in each treatment arm. The study was terminated early due to slow patient accrual. At day 60, there was one death in the vancomycin arm and none in the daptomycin arm. The median time to microbiological clearance was 4 days in both arms (IQR 3-5 days in the vancomycin arm and 3-7 days in daptomycin arm). Only one patient in the vancomycin arm had recurrence of bacteremia. Rates of adverse events were similar in both arms. There was one case of musculoskeletal toxicity and one case of drug-related nephrotoxicity - both events occurred in the daptomycin arm. None of the patients in either treatment arm required cessation of study treatment or addition of a second anti-MRSA agent because of worsening infection.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Based on the limited number of patients evaluated in this study, it remains unclear if alternative, more expensive agents such as daptomycin are superior to vancomycin in the treatment of high vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration MRSA bloodstream infections. More studies are urgently needed but investigators may wish to consider employing novel, alternative trial methodologies to ensure a greater chance of success.

Efficacy of Intrawound Vancomycin in Prevention of Periprosthetic Joint Infection After Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Prospective Double-Blinded Randomized Control Trial.,"Praharsha Mulpur, Tarun Jayakumar, Ramakanth R Yakkanti, Aditya Apte, Kushal Hippalgaonkar, Adarsh Annapareddy, A B Suhas Masilamani, A V Gurava Reddy, Praharsha Mulpuret al.",2024 Jun,J Arthroplasty,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38749600/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a devastating complication. Intrawound vancomycin powder has been shown to reduce infection rates in spine surgery, but its role in arthroplasty remains controversial. This prospective randomized control trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intrawound vancomycin in preventing PJI after primary TKA.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 1,022 patients were randomized to the study group (n = 507, who received 2 grams intrawound vancomycin powder before arthrotomy closure) or to the control group (n = 515, no local vancomycin) with a minimum follow-up of 12-months. The primary outcome was the incidence of PJI or surgical site infection (SSI). Secondary outcomes included associated minor complications such as stitch abscess, persistent wound drainage, and delayed stitch removal. Other parameters evaluated include reoperation rates and incidences of nephrotoxicity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The overall infection rate in 1,022 patients was 0.66%. There was no significant difference in PJI rate in the study group (N = 1; 0.2%) versus the control group (N = 3; 0.58%), P = .264. Reoperation rates in the study group (N = 4; 0.78%) and control (N = 5; 0.97%), and SSI rates in the study (N = 1; 0.2%) and control groups (N = 2; 0.38%) were comparable. The Vancomycin cohort, however, demonstrated a significantly higher number of minor wound complications (n = 67; 13.2%) compared to the control group (n = 39; 7.56%, P < .05). Subgroup analysis showed diabetics in the study group to also have a higher incidence of minor wound complications (24 [14.1%] versus 10 [6.2%]; P < 05]. Multivariate analyses found that vancomycin use (odds ratio = 1.64) and smoking (odds ratio = 1.85) were associated with an increased risk of developing minor wound complications. No cases of nephrotoxicity were reported.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intrawound vancomycin powder does not appear to reduce PJI/SSI rate in primary total knee arthroplasties, including high-risk groups. Although safe from a renal perspective, intrawound vancomycin was associated with an increase in postoperative aseptic wound complications. Intrawound vancomycin may not be effective in reducing the rate of PJI in primary TKA."
Benefit and harm of intensive blood pressure treatment: Derivation and validation of risk models using data from the SPRINT and ACCORD trials.,"Sanjay Basu, Jeremy B Sussman, Joseph Rigdon, Lauren Steimle, Brian T Denton, Rodney A Hayward, Sanjay Basuet al.",2017 Oct 17,PLoS Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29040268/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment can avert cardiovascular disease (CVD) events but can cause some serious adverse events. We sought to develop and validate risk models for predicting absolute risk difference (increased risk or decreased risk) for CVD events and serious adverse events from intensive BP therapy. A secondary aim was to test if the statistical method of elastic net regularization would improve the estimation of risk models for predicting absolute risk difference, as compared to a traditional backwards variable selection approach.
    


          Methods and findings:
        
      
      Cox models were derived from SPRINT trial data and validated on ACCORD-BP trial data to estimate risk of CVD events and serious adverse events; the models included terms for intensive BP treatment and heterogeneous response to intensive treatment. The Cox models were then used to estimate the absolute reduction in probability of CVD events (benefit) and absolute increase in probability of serious adverse events (harm) for each individual from intensive treatment. We compared the method of elastic net regularization, which uses repeated internal cross-validation to select variables and estimate coefficients in the presence of collinearity, to a traditional backwards variable selection approach. Data from 9,069 SPRINT participants with complete data on covariates were utilized for model development, and data from 4,498 ACCORD-BP participants with complete data were utilized for model validation. Participants were exposed to intensive (goal systolic pressure < 120 mm Hg) versus standard (<140 mm Hg) treatment. Two composite primary outcome measures were evaluated: (i) CVD events/deaths (myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, congestive heart failure, or CVD death), and (ii) serious adverse events (hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, bradycardia, or acute kidney injury/failure). The model for CVD chosen through elastic net regularization included interaction terms suggesting that older age, black race, higher diastolic BP, and higher lipids were associated with greater CVD risk reduction benefits from intensive treatment, while current smoking was associated with fewer benefits. The model for serious adverse events chosen through elastic net regularization suggested that male sex, current smoking, statin use, elevated creatinine, and higher lipids were associated with greater risk of serious adverse events from intensive treatment. SPRINT participants in the highest predicted benefit subgroup had a number needed to treat (NNT) of 24 to prevent 1 CVD event/death over 5 years (absolute risk reduction [ARR] = 0.042, 95% CI: 0.018, 0.066; P = 0.001), those in the middle predicted benefit subgroup had a NNT of 76 (ARR = 0.013, 95% CI: -0.0001, 0.026; P = 0.053), and those in the lowest subgroup had no significant risk reduction (ARR = 0.006, 95% CI: -0.007, 0.018; P = 0.71). Those in the highest predicted harm subgroup had a number needed to harm (NNH) of 27 to induce 1 serious adverse event (absolute risk increase [ARI] = 0.038, 95% CI: 0.014, 0.061; P = 0.002), those in the middle predicted harm subgroup had a NNH of 41 (ARI = 0.025, 95% CI: 0.012, 0.038; P < 0.001), and those in the lowest subgroup had no significant risk increase (ARI = -0.007, 95% CI: -0.043, 0.030; P = 0.72). In ACCORD-BP, participants in the highest subgroup of predicted benefit had significant absolute CVD risk reduction, but the overall ACCORD-BP participant sample was skewed towards participants with less predicted benefit and more predicted risk than in SPRINT. The models chosen through traditional backwards selection had similar ability to identify absolute risk difference for CVD as the elastic net models, but poorer ability to correctly identify absolute risk difference for serious adverse events. A key limitation of the analysis is the limited sample size of the ACCORD-BP trial, which expanded confidence intervals for ARI among persons with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, it is not possible to mechanistically explain the physiological relationships explaining the heterogeneous treatment effects captured by the models, since the study was an observational secondary data analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We found that predictive models could help identify subgroups of participants in both SPRINT and ACCORD-BP who had lower versus higher ARRs in CVD events/deaths with intensive BP treatment, and participants who had lower versus higher ARIs in serious adverse events."
Effect of Individualized vs Standard Blood Pressure Management Strategies on Postoperative Organ Dysfunction Among High-Risk Patients Undergoing Major Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Emmanuel Futier, Jean-Yves Lefrant, Pierre-Gregoire Guinot, Thomas Godet, Emmanuel Lorne, Philippe Cuvillon, Sebastien Bertran, Marc Leone, Bruno Pastene, Vincent Piriou, Serge Molliex, Jacques Albanese, Jean-Michel Julia, Benoit Tavernier, Etienne Imhoff, Jean-Etienne Bazin, Jean-Michel Constantin, Bruno Pereira, Samir Jaber                              ;, INPRESS Study Group, Emmanuel Futieret al.",2017 Oct 10,JAMA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28973220/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Perioperative hypotension is associated with an increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality, but the appropriate management strategy remains uncertain.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate whether an individualized blood pressure management strategy tailored to individual patient physiology could reduce postoperative organ dysfunction.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      The Intraoperative Norepinephrine to Control Arterial Pressure (INPRESS) study was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial conducted in 9 French university and nonuniversity hospitals. Adult patients (n = 298) at increased risk of postoperative complications with a preoperative acute kidney injury risk index of class III or higher (indicating moderate to high risk of postoperative kidney injury) undergoing major surgery lasting 2 hours or longer under general anesthesia were enrolled from December 4, 2012, through August 28, 2016 (last follow-up, September 28, 2016).
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Individualized management strategy aimed at achieving a systolic blood pressure (SBP) within 10% of the reference value (ie, patient's resting SBP) or standard management strategy of treating SBP less than 80 mm Hg or lower than 40% from the reference value during and for 4 hours following surgery.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was a composite of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and dysfunction of at least 1 organ system of the renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and neurologic systems by day 7 after surgery. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome, durations of ICU and hospital stay, adverse events, and all-cause mortality at 30 days after surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 298 patients who were randomized, 292 patients completed the trial (mean [SD] age, 70 [7] years; 44 [15.1%] women) and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome event occurred in 56 of 147 patients (38.1%) assigned to the individualized treatment strategy vs 75 of 145 patients (51.7%) assigned to the standard treatment strategy (relative risk, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.94; P = .02; absolute risk difference, -14%, 95% CI, -25% to -2%). Sixty-eight patients (46.3%) in the individualized treatment group and 92 (63.4%) in the standard treatment group had postoperative organ dysfunction by day 30 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.84; P = .001). There were no significant between-group differences in severe adverse events or 30-day mortality.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients predominantly undergoing abdominal surgery who were at increased postoperative risk, management targeting an individualized systolic blood pressure, compared with standard management, reduced the risk of postoperative organ dysfunction.

Nicorandil Decreases Renal Injury in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease Complicated With Type I Cardiorenal Syndrome.,"Xiaozhi Du, Zhiyong Ma, Li Li, Xuezhen Zhong, Xiaozhi Duet al.",2021 Sep 29,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34738551/,No keywords found,"Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) is a group of disorders in which heart or kidney dysfunction worsens each other. This study aimed to explore the improvement effect of nicorandil on cardiorenal injury in patients with type I CRS. Patients with coronary heart disease complicated with type I CRS were enrolled. Based on the conventional treatment, the patients were prospectively randomized into a conventional treatment group and a nicorandil group, which was treated with 24 mg/d nicorandil intravenously for 1 week. Fasting peripheral venous blood serum and urine were collected before and at the end of treatment. An automatic biochemical analyzer and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect B-type brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), serum creatinine (Scr) and cystatin C (Cys-C), renal injury index-kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels. The left ventricular ejection fraction was measured by echocardiography. All measurements were not significantly different between the nicorandil and conventional treatment groups before treatment (all P > 0.05), and BNP, Scr, Cys-C, NGAL, KIM-1, and IL-18 were decreased in the 2 groups at the end of treatment (all P < 0.05). Compared with the conventional treatment group, BNP, Scr, Cys-C, NGAL, KIM-1, and IL-18 were more significantly decreased in the nicorandil group (all P < 0.05) and left ventricular ejection fraction was more significantly increased (P < 0.05). Therefore, nicorandil could significantly improve the cardiac and renal function of patients with type I CRS. This may prove to be a new therapeutic tool for improving the prognosis and rehabilitation of type I CRS."
"Denosumab Versus Zoledronic Acid in Bone Disease Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma: An International, Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Phase 3 Study-Asian Subgroup Analysis.","Shang-Yi Huang, Sung-Soo Yoon, Kazuyuki Shimizu, Wee Joo Chng, Cheng-Shyong Chang, Raymond Siu-Ming Wong, Seasea Gao, Yang Wang, Steve W Gordon, Anthony Glennane, Chang-Ki Min, Shang-Yi Huanget al.",2020 Jul,Adv Ther,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32524500/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      The primary analysis of a global phase 3 study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of denosumab versus zoledronic acid for preventing skeletal-related events (SREs) in adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) indicated that denosumab was noninferior to zoledronic acid for time to first on-study SREs. Here we present a subgroup analysis to evaluate efficacy and safety in Asian patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously or zoledronic acid intravenously 4 mg every 4 weeks in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion. All patients received standard-of-care first-line antimyeloma treatment. Each patient received either study drug until an estimated 676 patients experienced at least one on-study SRE and the primary efficacy and safety analyses were completed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 1718 total enrolled patients, 196 Asian patients (denosumab, n = 103; zoledronic acid, n = 93) were included in this subgroup analysis. Fewer patients in the denosumab group developed first on-study SRE compared with the zoledronic acid group; the crude incidence of SREs at the primary analysis cutoff was 38.8% and 50.5%, respectively (HR [95% CI], 0.77 [0.48-1.26]). All 194 patients receiving at least one dose of study drug experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE. The most common AEs reported in either group (denosumab, zoledronic acid) were diarrhea (51.0%, 51.1%), nausea (42.2%, 46.7%), and pyrexia (38.2%, 41.3%). Treatment-emergent renal toxicity occurred in 9/102 (8.8%) and 20/92 (21.7%) patients, respectively. Similar rates of positively adjudicated osteonecrosis of the jaw (7 [6.9%] vs 5 [5.4%]) and treatment-emergent hypocalcemia (19 [18.6%] vs 17 [18.5%]) were reported in the denosumab and zoledronic acid groups, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Efficacy and safety outcomes from this Asian subgroup were comparable to those of the full study population. Overall, this analysis supports denosumab as an additional treatment option for standard of care for Asian patients with newly diagnosed MM with lytic bone lesions.

Rivaroxaban vs. warfarin and renal outcomes in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients with diabetes.,"Adrian V Hernandez, George Bradley, Mohammad Khan, Andrew Fratoni, Anna Gasparini, Yuani M Roman, Thomas J Bunz, Daniel Eriksson, Anna-Katharina Meinecke, Craig I Coleman, Adrian V Hernandezet al.",2020 Oct 1,Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31432074/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      Vascular calcification is common in diabetic patients. Warfarin has been associated with renovascular calcification and worsening renal function; rivaroxaban may provide renopreservation by decreasing vascular inflammation. We compared the impact of rivaroxaban and warfarin on renal outcomes in diabetic patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Using United States IBM MarketScan data from January 2011 to December 2017, we identified adults with both NVAF and diabetes, newly-initiated on rivaroxaban or warfarin with ≥12-month insurance coverage prior to anticoagulation initiation. Patients with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) or undergoing haemodialysis at baseline were excluded. Differences in baseline covariates between cohorts were adjusted using inverse probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) based on propensity scores (absolute standardized differences <0.1 achieved for all after adjustment). Outcomes included incidence rates of emergency department/hospital admissions for acute kidney injury (AKI) and the composite of the development of Stage 5 CKD or need for haemodialysis. Patients were followed until an event, index anticoagulant discontinuation/switch, insurance disenrollment, or end-of-data availability. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression. We assessed 10 017 rivaroxaban (22.6% received a reduced dose) and 11 665 warfarin users. In comparison to warfarin, rivaroxaban was associated with lower risks of AKI (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.74-0.92) and development of Stage 5 CKD or need for haemodialysis (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.70-0.96). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses had similar effects as the base-case analysis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Rivaroxaban appears to be associated with lower risks of undesirable renal outcomes vs. warfarin in diabetic NVAF patients."

Twelve patients with operable, recurrent platinum-sensitive EOC (recurrence ≥6 months after first-line therapy) were included according to the classical 3+3 dose-escalation design at three dose levels-60, 80 and 100 mg/m(2). After surgical cytoreduction, a single dose of cisplatin was administered via HIPEC for 90 min at 41-43°C. Postoperatively, all patients were treated with standard intravenous platinum-based combination chemotherapy. One of six patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 renal toxicity) at a dose of 100 mg/m(2). The remaining five patients treated with 100 mg/m(2) tolerated their treatment well. The recommended phase II dose was established at 100 mg/m(2). The mean peritoneal-to-plasma AUC ratio was 19·5 at the highest dose level. Cisplatin-induced DNA adducts were confirmed in tumor samples. Common postoperative grade 1-3 toxicities included fatigue, postoperative pain, nausea, and surgical site infection. The ability to administer standard intravenous platinum-based chemotherapy after HIPEC was uncompromised. Cisplatin administered as HIPEC at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) has an acceptable safety profile in selected patients undergoing secondary cytoreductive surgery for platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC. Favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of HIPEC with cisplatin were confirmed at all dose levels, especially at 100 mg/m(2). The results are encouraging to determine the efficacy of HIPEC as a complementary treatment in patients with EOC."
"The dose-related effects of dexmedetomidine on renal functions and serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin values after coronary artery bypass grafting: a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled study.","Ozan Onur Balkanay, Deniz Goksedef, Suat Nail Omeroglu, Gokhan Ipek, Ozan Onur Balkanayet al.",2015 Feb,Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25392341/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Acute kidney failure after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a serious complication that increases morbidity and mortality rates. Early detection and prevention of this complication are very important. A novel biomarker named neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) can play an important role in early diagnosis of acute kidney injury. Recent studies on the favourable effects of Dexmedetomidine on cardiac surgery have been published. The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a dose-dependent positive effect of Dexmedetomidine on neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels and renal functions when used after CABG.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Our randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted among 295 patients scheduled for CABG surgery between August 2009 and March 2011 in a tertiary cardiac and vascular surgery clinic. A total of 90 consecutive patients who met inclusion criteria were randomized and divided into three groups. The first group received a placebo. The second and the third groups received 4 and 8 µg/cc concentration of the Dexmedetomidine infusion, respectively. Infusion rates were regulated to obtain sedation with a Ramsey sedation score of 2 or 3. Patients were regrouped according to the total Dexmedetomidine dose. Statistical analyses of variables including serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin values and conventional renal function tests were made for all six possibilities before the blind was broken.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results of conventional renal function tests were not significantly different. However, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels for the first postoperative day for placebo, low-dose and high-dose Dexmedetomidine groups were 176.8 ± 145.9, 97.7 ± 63.4 and 67.3 ± 10.9 ng/ml, respectively. These values were significantly different among the groups (P <0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In our study, we found that Dexmedetomidine infusion for sedation after CABG under cardiopulmonary bypass can be useful in the prevention of kidney injury. Conventional renal function tests, including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, urine output and creatinine clearance rate measurements typically may not detect the development of acute kidney dysfunction in the first 48-h postoperative period. Differences were detected in renal function in the early postoperative period and the development of acute kidney injury, as determined by measurements of blood NGAL levels, was significant and dose-dependent."
Pharmacokinetics of Telavancin in Adult Patients with Cystic Fibrosis during Acute Pulmonary Exacerbation.,"James M Kidd, Colleen M Sakon, Louise-Marie Oleksiuk, Jeffrey J Cies, Rebecca S Pettit, David P Nicolau, Joseph L Kuti, James M Kiddet al.",2019 Dec 20,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31685468/,"Monte Carlo simulation, acute pulmonary exacerbation, cystic fibrosis, dose, glycopeptides, pharmacokinetics, probability of target attainment, telavancin.","Adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) frequently harbor Staphylococcus aureus, which is increasingly antibiotic resistant. Telavancin is a once-daily rapidly bactericidal antibiotic active against methicillin-, linezolid-, and ceftaroline-resistant S. aureus Because CF patients experience alterations in pharmacokinetics, the optimal dose of telavancin in this population is unknown. Adult CF patients (n = 18) admitted for exacerbations received 3 doses of telavancin 7.5 mg/kg of body weight (first 6 patients) or 10 mg/kg (final 12 patients) every 24 h (q24h). Population pharmacokinetic models with and without covariates were fitted using the nonparametric adaptive grid algorithm in Pmetrics. The final model was used to perform 5,000-patient Monte Carlo simulations for multiple telavancin doses. The best fit was a 2-compartment model describing the volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc ) as a multiple of total body weight (TBW) and the volume of distribution of the central compartment scaled to total body weight (Vθ) normalized by the median observed value (Vc = Vθ × TBW/52.1) and total body clearance (CL) as a linear function of creatinine clearance (CRCL) (CL = CLNR + CLθ × CRCL), where CLNR represents nonrenal clearance and CLθ represents the slope term on CRCL to estimate renal clearance. The mean population parameters were as follows: Vθ, 4.92 ± 0.76 liters · kg-1; CLNR, 0.59 ± 0.30 liters · h-1; CLθ, 5.97 × 10-3 ± 1.24 × 10-3; Vp (volume of the peripheral compartment), 3.77 ± 1.41 liters; Q (intercompartmental clearance), 4.08 ± 2.17 liters · h-1 The free area under the concentration-time curve (fAUC) values for 7.5 and 10 mg/kg were 30 ± 4.6 and 52 ± 12 mg · h/liter, respectively. Doses of 7.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg achieved 76.5% and 100% probability of target attainment (PTA) at a fAUC/MIC threshold of >215, respectively, for MIC of ≤0.12 mg/liter. The probabilities of reaching the acute kidney injury (AKI) threshold AUC (763 mg · h · liter-1) for these doses were 0% and 0.96%, respectively. No serious adverse events occurred. Telavancin 10 mg/kg yielded optimal PTA and minimal risk of AKI, suggesting that this FDA-approved dose is appropriate to treat acute pulmonary exacerbations in CF adults. (The clinical trial discussed in this study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT03172793.)."
Administration of HES in elderly patients undergoing hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia is not associated with an increase in renal injury.,"Yuanyuan Zhang, Yonghao Yu, Junya Jia, Wenli Yu, Rubin Xu, Licheng Geng, Ying Wei, Yuanyuan Zhanget al.",2017 Feb 21,BMC Anesthesiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28222674/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is applied to achieve volume expansion during surgery; however, nephrotoxicity may be induced in patients with sepsis. Simultaneously, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and IL-18 have been illustrated as pivotal indicators to diagnose the acute kidney injury (AKI) early. This multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study aimed to investigate whether 6% HES 130/0.4 administration caused postoperative AKI, which can be revealed by urinary and plasma NGAL and IL-18 estimations in elderly patients with normal renal function undergoing hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      120 ASA I-III, patients aged >65 y undergoing hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia randomly received 6% HES 130/0.4 or sodium lactate Ringer's solution 7.5 mL/kg during the first hour of surgery. 118 patients completed the study. Blood pressure, NGAL concentrations, IL18, β2 micro-albumin and albumin in urine and creatinine, NGAL and IL-18 in plasma were repeatedly measured before, during, and after surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The groups were balanced in mean arterial pressure, urine and plasma NGAL, plasma IL-18 and creatinine, urine β2 microalbumin and albumin (P > 0.05). Urine IL-18 was dramatically elevated in both groups after surgery (P < 0.05), but did not vary significantly between the groups (P > 0.05).

Avoiding the emergence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in acute coronary syndrome: routine hydration treatment.,"Sukru Arslan, Ahmet Yildiz, Yalcin Dalgic, Servet Batit, Onur Kilicarslan, Ozgur Selim Ser, Sadiye Nur Dalgic, Cuneyt Kocas, Okay Abaci, Sukru Arslanet al.",2021 Aug 1,Coron Artery Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33060531/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have about a three-fold risk for developing contrast-induced acute kidney injury(CI-AKI). Investigating studies on routine hydration therapy have frequently included patients with stable coronary artery disease and high risk of CI-AKI [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min]. However, data on routine hydration treatment in non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients with eGFR ≥60 ml/min are insufficient. We aimed to investigate the association between routine hydration therapy and CI-AKI development in NSTEMI patients at low risk for nephropathy.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      We randomly assigned a total of 401 NSTEMI patients to two groups: the routine hydration group (198 patients) and the nonhydration group (control group) (203 patients). Intravenous hydration with isotonic saline (1 ml/kg/h, 0.9% sodium chloride) was given for 3-12 h before and 24 h after contrast exposure to the hydration group. CI-AKI was defined as the increase in serum creatinine values 0.5 mg/dl or 25% between 48 and 72 h after the invasive procedures. In our study, the incidence of CI-AKI development in the routine hydration group (7.1%) was significantly lower than in the nonhydration group (14.1%) (P: 0.02). This study revealed that older age, amount of contrast media, and routine hydration were independent risk factors for developing CI-AKI (P < 0.01, P: 0.04, P < 0.01, respectively).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We found that preprocedural and postprocedural intravenous hydration therapy reduces the development of CI-AKI in patients with NSTEMI at low risk for CI-AKI. We suggest administering routine hydration therapy in all ACS patients regardless of eGFR values."
Changes in tubular biomarkers with dietary intervention and metformin in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a post-hoc analysis of two clinical trials.,"Wei Wang, Zhiying You, Cortney N Steele, Berenice Gitomer, Michel Chonchol, Kristen L Nowak, Wei Wanget al.",2024 Jun 25,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38918734/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Tubular biomarkers, which reflect tubular dysfunction or injury, are associated with incident chronic kidney disease and kidney function decline. Several tubular biomarkers have also been implicated in the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We evaluated changes in multiple tubular biomarkers in four groups of patients with ADPKD who participated in one of two clinical trials (metformin therapy and diet-induced weight loss), based on evidence suggesting that such interventions could reduce tubule injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      66 participants (26 M/40 F) with ADPKD and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73m2 who participated in either a metformin clinical trial (n = 22 metformin; n = 23 placebo) or dietary weight loss study (n = 10 daily caloric restriction [DCR]; n = 11 intermittent fasting [IMF]) were included in assessments of urinary tubular biomarkers (kidney injury molecule-1 [KIM-1], fatty-acid binding protein [FABP], interleukin-18 [IL-18], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL], clusterin, and human cartilage glycoprotein-40 [YKL-40]; normalized to urine creatinine), at baseline and 12 months. The association of baseline tubular biomarkers with both baseline and change in height-adjusted total kidney volume (HtTKV; percent change from baseline to 12 months) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; absolute change at 12 months vs. baseline), with covariate adjustment, was also assessed using multiple linear regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean ± s.d. age was 48 ± 8 years, eGFR was 71 ± 16 ml/min/1.73m2, and baseline BMI was 30.5 ± 5.9 kg/m2. None of the tubular biomarkers changed with any intervention as compared to placebo. Additionally, baseline tubular biomarkers were not associated with either baseline or change in eGFR or HtTKV over 12 months, after adjustments for demographics, group assignment, and clinical characteristics.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Tubular biomarkers did not change with dietary-induced weight loss or metformin, nor did they associate with kidney disease progression, in this cohort of patients with ADPKD."

      Multiple myeloma is characterised by monoclonal paraprotein production and osteolytic lesions, commonly leading to skeletal-related events (spinal cord compression, pathological fracture, or surgery or radiotherapy to affected bone). Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting RANKL, reduces skeletal-related events associated with bone lesions or metastases in patients with advanced solid tumours. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this international, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 study, patients in 259 centres and 29 countries aged 18 years or older with symptomatic newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who had at least one documented lytic bone lesion were randomly assigned (1:1; centrally, by interactive voice response system using a fixed stratified permuted block randomisation list with a block size of four) to subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg plus intravenous placebo every 4 weeks or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg plus subcutaneous placebo every 4 weeks (both groups also received investigators' choice of first-line antimyeloma therapy). Stratification was by intent to undergo autologous transplantation, antimyeloma therapy, International Staging System stage, previous skeletal-related events, and region. The clinical study team and patients were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of denosumab to zoledronic acid with respect to time to first skeletal-related event in the full analysis set (all randomly assigned patients). All safety endpoints were analysed in the safety analysis set, which includes all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of active study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01345019.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      From May 17, 2012, to March 29, 2016, we enrolled 1718 patients and randomly assigned 859 to each treatment group. The study met the primary endpoint; denosumab was non-inferior to zoledronic acid for time to first skeletal-related event (hazard ratio 0·98, 95% CI 0·85-1·14; pnon-inferiority=0·010). 1702 patients received at least one dose of the investigational drug and were included in the safety analysis (850 patients receiving denosumab and 852 receiving zoledronic acid). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events for denosumab and zoledronic acid were neutropenia (126 [15%] vs 125 [15%]), thrombocytopenia (120 [14%] vs 103 [12%]), anaemia (100 [12%] vs 85 [10%]), febrile neutropenia (96 [11%] vs 87 [10%]), and pneumonia (65 [8%] vs 70 [8%]). Renal toxicity was reported in 85 (10%) patients in the denosumab group versus 146 (17%) in the zoledronic acid group; hypocalcaemia adverse events were reported in 144 (17%) versus 106 (12%). Incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw was not significantly different between the denosumab and zoledronic acid groups (35 [4%] vs 24 [3%]; p=0·147). The most common serious adverse event for both treatment groups was pneumonia (71 [8%] vs 69 [8%]). One patient in the zoledronic acid group died of cardiac arrest that was deemed treatment-related.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      In patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, denosumab was non-inferior to zoledronic acid for time to skeletal-related events. The results from this study suggest denosumab could be an additional option for the standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma with bone disease.

Effect of empagliflozin on circulating proteomics in heart failure: mechanistic insights into the EMPEROR programme.,"Faiez Zannad, João Pedro Ferreira, Javed Butler, Gerasimos Filippatos, James L Januzzi, Mikhail Sumin, Matthias Zwick, Maral Saadati, Stuart J Pocock, Naveed Sattar, Stefan D Anker, Milton Packer, Faiez Zannadet al.",2022 Dec 21,Eur Heart J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36017745/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve cardiovascular outcomes in diverse patient populations, but their mechanism of action requires further study. The aim is to explore the effect of empagliflozin on the circulating levels of intracellular proteins in patients with heart failure, using large-scale proteomics.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Over 1250 circulating proteins were measured at baseline, Week 12, and Week 52 in 1134 patients from EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved, using the Olink® Explore 1536 platform. Statistical and bioinformatical analyses identified differentially expressed proteins (empagliflozin vs. placebo), which were then linked to demonstrated biological actions in the heart and kidneys. At Week 12, 32 of 1283 proteins fulfilled our threshold for being differentially expressed, i.e. their levels were changed by ≥10% with a false discovery rate <1% (empagliflozin vs. placebo). Among these, nine proteins demonstrated the largest treatment effect of empagliflozin: insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1, transferrin receptor protein 1, carbonic anhydrase 2, erythropoietin, protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 2, thymosin beta-10, U-type mitochondrial creatine kinase, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4, and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 4. The changes of the proteins from baseline to Week 52 were generally concordant with the changes from the baseline to Week 12, except empagliflozin reduced levels of kidney injury molecule-1 by ≥10% at Week 52, but not at Week 12. The most common biological action of differentially expressed proteins appeared to be the promotion of autophagic flux in the heart, kidney or endothelium, a feature of 6 proteins. Other effects of differentially expressed proteins on the heart included the reduction of oxidative stress, inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis, and the enhancement of mitochondrial health and energy, repair, and regenerative capacity. The actions of differentially expressed proteins in the kidney involved promotion of autophagy, integrity and regeneration, suppression of renal inflammation and fibrosis, and modulation of renal tubular sodium reabsorption.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Changes in circulating protein levels in patients with heart failure are consistent with the findings of experimental studies that have shown that the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are likely related to actions on the heart and kidney to promote autophagic flux, nutrient deprivation signalling and transmembrane sodium transport."
Effect of Dongchongxiacao (Cordyceps) therapy on contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography.,"Zhao Kai, Li Yongjian, Gao Sheng, Lin Yu, Zhao Kaiet al.",2015 Aug,J Tradit Chin Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26427112/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To study the protective effects of Dongchongxiacao (Cordyceps) (DCXC) on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 120 patients with type 2 diabetes whose estimated glomerular filtration rater (eGFR) was 60 mL/min · 1.73 in2, were divided randomly into three groups, basic treatment group (n = 41), standard DCXC therapy group (n = 39, 2-g corbrin capsules, 3 times/d, 3 days before and after angiography), and intensive DCXC therapy group (n = 40, 3-g corbrin capsules, 3 times/d, 3 days before and after angiography). Serum creatinine (cr) and eGFR were assessed at the time of admission to hospital, and on days 1, 2 and 3 after angiography. Urine neutrophil-gelatinase-associated-lipo- calin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were measured before angiography and at day 1 after angiography for all patients. The primary end point was the prevalence of CIN. The secondary end point was a 25% or greater reduction in eGFR.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CIN occurred in 11 of 120 patients (9.17 %). The prevalence of CIN was lower in the DCXC treatment groups than in the basic treatment group (P < 0.05), with a more significant decrease in the prevalence of CIN in the intensive DCXC therapy group (P < 0.01). Compared with the basic treatment group, a lower proportion of patients in the DCXC treatment groups had an eGFR decrease of 25% or greater (P < 0.05); patients with an eGFR decrease of 25% or greater accounted for an even lower proportion in the intensive DCXC therapy group (P < 0.01). Within 1 day of the procedure, urine levels of KIM-1, NGAL and IL-18 in patients in the intensive DCXC therapy group were lower than those in the basic treatment group and standard therapy group (P < 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      DCXC treatment may protect against CIN in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography, with intensive DCXC therapy being more effective."
Effects of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ronopterin (VAS203) on renal function in healthy volunteers.,"Christian Ott, Agnes Bosch, Nicole Winzer, Stephanie Friedrich, Reinhard Schinzel, Frank Tegtmeier, Roland E Schmieder, Christian Ottet al.",2019 May,Br J Clin Pharmacol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30666700/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      Reduced nitric oxide (NO) availability may adversely affect renal perfusion and glomerular filtration. The aim of the present study was to characterize in detail the pharmacological effects of VAS203, an inhibitor of NO synthase, on renal haemodynamics in humans.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over phase-I-study comprised 18 healthy men. Renal haemodynamics were assessed with constant-infusion input-clearance technique with p-aminohippurate and inulin for renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), respectively. After baseline measurement, a constant infusion of the tetrahydrobiopterin analogue ronopterin (VAS203, total 10 mg/kg body weight) or placebo was administered at random order for 6 hours additionally. After a wash-out phase of 28 days, the second course was applied. In parallel, markers of early kidney injury and renal function were assessed repeatedly up to 48 hours after starting VAS203/placebo-infusion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      VAS203-infusion resulted in a significant decrease of RPF (P < .0001) and GFR (P < .001) compared to placebo, but magnitude was within the physiological range. RPF and GFR recovered partly 2 hours after end of VAS203-infusion and was normal at beginning of the second infusion period. Compared to placebo, preglomerular resistance (P < .0001), and to lesser extent postglomerular resistance (P < .0001) increased, resulting in a decrease of intraglomerular pressure (P < .01). No treatment related effect on markers of early kidney injury, and on renal function (P for all >.20) have been observed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our phase-I-study in healthy humans indicates that VAS203 (10 mg/kg body weight) reduces renal perfusion and glomerular function within the physiological range mainly due to vasoconstriction at the preglomerular site."
Clinical outcomes of liver transplantation in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis B virus coinfected patients in China.,"Jianxin Tang#, Ruihui Weng#, Taishi Fang, Kangjun Zhang, Xu Yan, Xin Jin, Linjie Xie, Dong Zhao, Jianxin Tanget al.",2024 Apr 8,BMC Infect Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38589801/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been able to improve the immune system function and survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. However, Patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are more likely to develop end-stage liver disease (ESLD) than those infected with HBV alone. Consequently, liver transplantation is often required for these patients. This study evaluates the outcomes of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) of HIV-HBV coinfected patients in China.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a retrospective analysis on all HIV-HBV coinfected patients that underwent OLT from April 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 and their outcomes were compared to all HBV monoinfected patients undergoing OLT during the same period. Patient outcomes were determined, including cumulative survival, viral load, CD4 T-cell count and postoperative complications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The median follow-up of HIV recipients was 36 months after OLT (interquartile range 12-39 months). Almost all patients had stable CD4 T-cell count (> 200 copies/ul), undetectable HBV DNA levels, and undetectable HIV RNA load during follow-up. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year posttransplant survival rates were 85.7% for the HIV group (unchanged from 1 to 3 years) versus 82.2%, 81.2%, and 78.8% for the non-HIV group. Cumulative survival among HIV-HBV coinfected recipients was not significantly different from the HBV monoinfected recipients (log-rank test P = 0.692). The percentage of deaths attributed to infection was comparable between the HIV and non-HIV groups (14.3% vs. 9.32%, P = 0.665). Post OLT, there was no significant difference in acute rejection, cytomegalovirus infection, bacteremia, pulmonary infection, acute kidney injury, de novo tumor and vascular and biliary complications.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Liver transplantation in patients with HIV-HBV coinfection yields excellent outcomes in terms of intermediate- or long-term survival rate and low incidence of postoperative complications in China. These findings suggest that OLT is safe and feasible for HIV-HBV coinfected patients with ESLD.

Phase II study of vemurafenib in children and young adults with tumors harboring BRAF V600 mutations: NCI-COG pediatric MATCH trial (APEC1621) Arm G.,"Marie V Nelson, AeRang Kim, P Mickey Williams, Sinchita Roy-Chowdhuri, David R Patton, Brent D Coffey, Joel M Reid, Jin Piao, Lauren Saguilig, Todd A Alonzo, Stacey L Berg, Nilsa C Ramirez, Alok Jaju, Elizabeth Fox, Brenda J Weigel, Douglas S Hawkins, Margaret M Mooney, Naoko Takebe, James V Tricoli, Katherine A Janeway, Nita L Seibel, D Williams Parsons, Marie V Nelsonet al.",2024 Aug 5,Oncologist,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38873934/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      This is a phase II subprotocol of the NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH study evaluating vemurafenib, a selective oral inhibitor of BRAF V600 mutated kinase, in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors harboring BRAF V600 mutations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients received vemurafenib at 550 mg/m2 (maximum 960 mg/dose) orally twice daily for 28-day cycles until progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary aim was to determine the objective response rate and secondary objectives included estimating progression-free survival and assessing the tolerability of vemurafenib.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-two patients matched to the subprotocol and 4 patients (18%) enrolled. Primary reasons for non-enrollment were ineligibility due to exclusions of low-grade glioma (n = 7) and prior BRAF inhibitor therapy (n = 7). Enrolled diagnoses were one each of histiocytosis, ameloblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and high-grade glioma, all with BRAF V600E mutations. Treatment was overall tolerable with mostly expected grade 1/2 adverse events (AE). Grade 3 or 4 AE on treatment were acute kidney injury, hyperglycemia, and maculopapular rash. One patient came off therapy due to AE. One patient (glioma) had an objective partial response and remained on protocol therapy for 15 cycles.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There was a low accrual rate on this MATCH subprotocol, with only 18% of those who matched with BRAFV600 mutations enrolling, resulting in early termination, and limiting study results (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03220035)."

      Therapies for refractory cytomegalovirus infections (with or without resistance [R/R]) in transplant recipients are limited by toxicities. Maribavir has multimodal anti-cytomegalovirus activity through the inhibition of UL97 protein kinase.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this phase 3, open-label study, hematopoietic-cell and solid-organ transplant recipients with R/R cytomegalovirus were randomized 2:1 to maribavir 400 mg twice daily or investigator-assigned therapy (IAT; valganciclovir/ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir) for 8 weeks, with 12 weeks of follow-up. The primary endpoint was confirmed cytomegalovirus clearance at end of week 8. The key secondary endpoint was achievement of cytomegalovirus clearance and symptom control at end of week 8, maintained through week 16.
    


          Results:
        
      
      352 patients were randomized (235 maribavir; 117 IAT). Significantly more patients in the maribavir versus IAT group achieved the primary endpoint (55.7% vs 23.9%; adjusted difference [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 32.8% [22.80-42.74]; P < .001) and key secondary endpoint (18.7% vs 10.3%; adjusted difference [95% CI]: 9.5% [2.02-16.88]; P = .01). Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between groups (maribavir, 97.4%; IAT, 91.4%). Maribavir was associated with less acute kidney injury versus foscarnet (8.5% vs 21.3%) and neutropenia versus valganciclovir/ganciclovir (9.4% vs 33.9%). Fewer patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs with maribavir (13.2%) than IAT (31.9%). One patient per group had fatal treatment-related TEAEs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Maribavir was superior to IAT for cytomegalovirus viremia clearance and viremia clearance plus symptom control maintained post-therapy in transplant recipients with R/R cytomegalovirus. Maribavir had fewer treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs than IAT. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT02931539 (SOLSTICE)."

      Resistance to approved inhibitors of KIT proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) is a clinical challenge for patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours. We compared the efficacy and safety of ripretinib, a switch-control tyrosine kinase inhibitor active against a broad spectrum of KIT and PDGFRA mutations, with placebo in patients with previously treated, advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we enrolled adult patients in 29 specialised hospitals in 12 countries. We included patients aged 18 years or older who had advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours with progression on at least imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib or documented intolerance to any of these treatments despite dose modifications, and who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either oral ripretinib 150 mg once daily (ripretenib group) or placebo once daily (placebo group). Randomisation was done via an interactive response system using randomly permuted block sizes of six and stratified according to number of previous therapies and ECOG performance status. Patients, investigators, research staff, and the sponsor study team were masked to a patient's treatment allocation until the blinded independent central review (BICR) showed progressive disease for the patient. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed by BICR. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Patients randomly assigned to placebo were permitted to cross over to ripretinib 150 mg at the time of disease progression. The INVICTUS study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03353753, and with WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, number EUCTR2017-002446-76-ES; follow-up is ongoing.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Feb 27, 2018, and Nov 16, 2018, 129 of 154 assessed patients were randomly assigned to receive either ripretinib (n=85) or placebo (n=44). At data cutoff (May 31, 2019), at a median follow-up of 6·3 months (IQR 3·2-8·2) in the ripretinib group and 1·6 months (1·1-2·7) in the placebo group, 51 patients in the ripretinib group and 37 in the placebo group had had progression-free survival events. In the double-blind period, median progression-free survival was 6·3 months (95% CI 4·6-6·9) with ripretinib compared with 1·0 months (0·9-1·7) with placebo (hazard ratio 0·15, 95% CI 0·09-0·25; p<0·0001). The most common (>2%) grade 3 or 4 treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events in the ripretinib group (n=85) included lipase increase (four [5%]), hypertension (three [4%]), fatigue (two [2%]), and hypophosphataemia (two (2%]); in the placebo group (n=43), the most common (>2%) grade 3 or 4 treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia (three [7%]), fatigue (one [2%]), diarrhoea (one [2%]), decreased appetite (one [2%]), dehydration (one [2%]), hyperkalaemia (one [2%]), acute kidney injury (one [2%]), and pulmonary oedema (one [2%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in eight (9%) of 85 patients who received ripretinib and three (7%) of 43 patients who received placebo. Treatment-related deaths occurred in one patient in the placebo group (septic shock and pulmonary oedema) and one patient in the ripretinib group (cause of death unknown; the patient died during sleep).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Ripretinib significantly improved median progression-free survival compared with placebo and had an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours who were resistant to approved treatments.

      Prospective, single-center trials have shown that the implementation of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommendations in high-risk patients significantly reduced the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) after surgery. We sought to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a bundle of supportive measures based on the KDIGO guideline in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery in a multicenter setting in preparation for a large definitive trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this multicenter, multinational, randomized controlled trial, we examined the adherence to the KDIGO bundle consisting of optimization of volume status and hemodynamics, functional hemodynamic monitoring, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, and prevention of hyperglycemia in high-risk patients identified by the urinary biomarkers tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 [TIMP-2] and insulin growth factor-binding protein 7 [IGFBP7] after cardiac surgery. The primary end point was the adherence to the bundle protocol and was evaluated by the percentage of compliant patients with a 95% confidence interval (CI) according to Clopper-Pearson. Secondary end points included the development and severity of AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 278 patients were included in the final analysis. In the intervention group, 65.4% of patients received the complete bundle as compared to 4.2% in the control group (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 61.2 [95% CI, 52.6-69.9]; P < .001). AKI rates were statistically not different in both groups (46.3% intervention versus 41.5% control group; ARR -4.8% [95% CI, -16.4 to 6.9]; P = .423). However, the occurrence of moderate and severe AKI was significantly lower in the intervention group as compared to the control group (14.0% vs 23.9%; ARR 10.0% [95% CI, 0.9-19.1]; P = .034). There were no significant effects on other specified secondary outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Implementation of a KDIGO-derived treatment bundle is feasible in a multinational setting. Furthermore, moderate to severe AKI was significantly reduced in the intervention group."
The effect of L-thyroxine substitution on oxidative stress in early-stage diabetic nephropathy patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled study.,"Yong Chen, Ganlin Wu, Meirong Xu, Yong Chenet al.",2018 Jan,Int Urol Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29196928/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      To study oxidative stress status of early type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and to assess effect of L-thyroxine therapy on the oxidative stress in these patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      It is a randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled trial. A total of 48 patients with early type 2 DN were included as Euthyroid group, and 92 early type 2 DN with SCH were selected and randomly assigned to L-thyroxine treatment group (LT4 group) and placebo group (SCH group). Changes in urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER), serum malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, urine 8-hydroxyl deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and lipid profile before and after 24 weeks of follow-up were examined and compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The levels of UAER, MDA, 8-OHdG were higher, while the SOD activity was lower in DN patients with SCH than in DN patients (p < 0.05 for all). In the LT4 group, the levels of UAER, MDA, 8-OHdG decreased significantly (p < 0.05) to levels no longer different from the Euthyroid group. The SOD activity increased significantly. But in SCH group, the levels of mAlb, MDA, 8-OHdG were greater after 24 weeks of follow-up and greater than patients in the Euthyroid group. SOD activity decreased significantly after 24 weeks in the SCH group (p < 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Oxidative stress is greater in the DN patients with SCH, and SCH may exacerbate kidney injury in early DN patients. The LT4 treatment may decrease the oxidative stress and attenuate renal injury in DN patient with SCH."
Cardiac output-guided haemodynamic therapy for patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery: OPTIMISE II randomised clinical trial.,"OPTIMISE II Trial Group, OPTIMISE II Trial Group.",2024 Dec 3:387:e080439.,BMJ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39626899/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a perioperative algorithm for cardiac output-guided haemodynamic therapy in patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Multicentre randomised controlled trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Surgical services of 55 hospitals worldwide.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      2498 adults aged ≥65 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification of II or greater and undergoing major elective gastrointestinal surgery, recruited between January 2017 and September 2022.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants were assigned to minimally invasive cardiac output-guided intravenous fluid therapy with low dose inotrope infusion during and four hours after surgery, or to usual care without cardiac output monitoring.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was postoperative infection within 30 days of randomisation. Safety outcomes were acute cardiac events within 24 hours and 30 days. Secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury within 30 days and mortality within 180 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In 2498 patients (mean age 74 (standard deviation 6) years, 57% women), the primary outcome occurred in 289/1247 (23.2%) intervention patients and 283/1247 (22.7%) usual care patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.25); P=0.81). Acute cardiac events within 24 hours occurred in 38/1250 (3.0%) intervention patients and 21/1247 (1.7%) usual care patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.82 (1.06 to 3.13); P=0.03). This difference was primarily due to an increased incidence of arrhythmias among intervention patients. Acute cardiac events within 30 days occurred in 85/1249 (6.8%) intervention patients and 79/1247 (6.3%) usual care patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.06 (0.77 to 1.47); P=0.71). Other secondary outcomes did not differ.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This clinical effectiveness trial in patients undergoing major elective gastrointestinal surgery did not provide evidence that cardiac output-guided intravenous fluid therapy with low dose inotrope infusion could reduce the incidence of postoperative infections. The intervention was associated with an increased incidence of acute cardiac events within 24 hours, in particular tachyarrhythmias. Based on these findings, the routine use of this treatment approach in unselected patients is not recommended.

Randomized Trial of Carnitine for the Prevention of Perioperative Atrial Fibrillation.,"Farzaneh Dastan, Azita Hajhossein Talasaz, Mojtaba Mojtahedzadeh, Abbassali Karimi, Abbas Salehiomran, Payvand Bina, Arash Jalali, Farzaneh Dastanet al.",2018 Spring,Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28982550/,"L-carnitine, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery bypass grafting.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common complications in patients who undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of L-carnitine administration on postoperative AF and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) following CABG. The effects of L-carnitine on the incidence of acute kidney injury after CABG were also assessed. One hundred thirty-four patients undergoing elective CABG, without a history of AF or previous L-carnitine treatment, were randomly assigned to an L-carnitine group (3000 mg/d L-carnitine) or a control group. CRP levels, as a biomarker of inflammation, were assessed in all the patients before surgery as baseline levels and 48 hours postoperatively. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, as a kidney biomarker, was also measured in the patients before surgery and 2 hours thereafter. The incidence of AF was 13.4% in our population. The incidence of AF was decreased in the L-carnitine group (7.5% in the L-carnitine group vs 19.4% in the control group; P = 0.043) and the postoperative CRP level (8.79 ± 6.9 in the L-carnitine group, and 10.83 ± 5.7 in the control group; P = 0.021). The postoperative neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration demonstrated no significant rise after surgery compared with the preoperative concentration (72.54 ± 20.30 in the L-carnitine group vs 67.68 ± 22.71 in the placebo group; P = 0.19). Our study showed that L-carnitine administration before CABG might inhibit and reduce the incidence of AF after CABG. It seems that a rise in the CRP level, as an inflammation marker, may be associated with the incidence of AF. Inflammation as measured by CRP was also reduced in the carnitine group, compared with the control group."

      The addition of nivolumab to chemotherapy improves survival in patients with advanced oesophagogastric (oesophageal, gastric, or gastro-oesophageal junction) adenocarcinoma; however, outcomes remain poor. We assessed the safety and activity of regorafenib in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This investigator-initiated, single-arm, phase 2 trial in adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with previously untreated, HER2-negative, metastatic oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma was done at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA). Eligible patients had measurable disease or non-measurable disease that was evaluable (defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] version 1.1) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients received FOLFOX chemotherapy (fluorouracil [400 mg/m2 bolus followed by 2400 mg/m2 over 48 h], leucovorin [400 mg/m2], and oxaliplatin [85 mg/m2]) and nivolumab (240 mg) intravenously on days 1 and 15, and oral regorafenib (80 mg) on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. Treatment was continued until disease progression (defined by RECIST version 1.1), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival in the per-protocol population (ie, all participants who received a dose of all study treatments). The regimen would be considered worthy of further investigation if at least 24 of 35 patients were progression free at 6 months. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of any study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04757363, and is now complete.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Feb 11, 2021, and May 4, 2022, 39 patients were enrolled, received at least one dose of study drug, and were included in safety analyses. 35 patients were evaluable for 6-month progression-free survival. Median age was 57 years (IQR 52-66), nine (26%) patients were women, 26 (74%) were men, 28 (80%) were White, and seven (20%) were Asian. At data cutoff (March 3, 2023), median follow-up was 18·1 months (IQR 12·7-20·4). The primary endpoint was reached, with 25 (71%; 95% CI 54-85) of 35 patients progression free at 6 months. Nine (26%) of 35 patients had disease progression and one (3%) patient died; the death was unrelated to treatment. The most common adverse event of any grade was fatigue (36 [92%] of 39). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (18 [46%]), hypertension (six [15%]), dry skin, pruritus, or rash (five [13%]), and anaemia (four [10%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in ten (26%) patients, which were acute kidney injury (three [8%]), hepatotoxicity (two [5%]), sepsis (two [5%]), dry skin, pruritus, or rash (one [3%]), nausea (one [3%]), and gastric perforation (one [3%]). There were no treatment-related deaths.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Regorafenib can be safely combined with nivolumab and chemotherapy and showed promising activity in HER2-negative metastatic oesophagogastric cancer. A randomised, phase 3 clinical trial is planned.

BeeCovid2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients. Patients were allocated to receive an oral dose of 900 mg/day of EPP-AF® or placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included safety, secondary infection rate, duration of oxygen therapy dependency, acute kidney injury and need for intensive care. Patients were followed up for 28 days after admission. We enrolled 188 patients; 98 were assigned to the propolis group and 90 to the placebo group. The post-intervention length of hospital stay was of 6.5 ± 6.0 days in the propolis group versus 7.7 ± 7.1 days in the control group (95% CI - 0.74 [- 1.94 to 0.42]; p = 0.22). Propolis did not have significant impact on the need for oxygen supplementation or frequency of AKI.

      Data regarding the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the elderly (age ≥65 years) and very elderly (age ≥75 years) are limited.
    


          Research design and methods:
        
      
      The Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE)-TIMI 58 assessed cardiac and renal outcomes of dapagliflozin versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes. Efficacy and safety outcomes were studied within age subgroups for treatment effect and age-based treatment interaction.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 17,160 patients, 9,253 were <65 years of age, 6,811 ≥65 to <75 years, and 1,096 ≥75 years. Dapagliflozin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure consistently, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.72, 1.07), 0.77 (0.63, 0.94), and 0.94 (0.65, 1.36) in age-groups <65, ≥65 to <75, and ≥75 years, respectively (interaction P value 0.5277). Overall, dapagliflozin did not significantly decrease the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, with HR 0.93 (95% CI 0.81, 1.08), 0.97 (0.83, 1.13), and 0.84 (0.61, 1.15) in age-groups <65, ≥65 to <75, and ≥75 years, respectively (interaction P value 0.7352). The relative risk reduction for the secondary prespecified cardiorenal composite outcome ranged from 18% to 28% in the different age-groups with no heterogeneity. Major hypoglycemia was less frequent with dapagliflozin versus placebo, with HR 0.97 (95% CI 0.58, 1.64), 0.50 (0.29, 0.84), and 0.68 (0.29, 1.57) in age-groups <65, ≥65 to <75, and ≥75 years, respectively (interaction P value 0.2107). Safety outcomes, including fractures, volume depletion, cancer, urinary tract infections, and amputations were balanced with dapagliflozin versus placebo, and acute kidney injury was reduced, all regardless of age. Genital infections that were serious or led to discontinuation of the study drug and diabetic ketoacidosis were uncommon, yet more frequent with dapagliflozin versus placebo, without heterogeneity (interaction P values 0.1058 and 0.8433, respectively).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The overall efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin are consistent regardless of age."
Ambient heat exposure and kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease: a post-hoc analysis of the DAPA-CKD trial.,"Zhiyan Zhang, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Glenn M Chertow, Ricardo Correa-Rotter, Antonio Gasparrini, Niels Jongs, Anna Maria Langkilde, John J V McMurray, Malcolm N Mistry, Peter Rossing, Robert D Toto, Priya Vart, Dorothea Nitsch, David C Wheeler, Ben Caplin, Zhiyan Zhanget al.",2024 Apr,Lancet Planet Health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38580424/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Higher temperatures are associated with higher rates of hospital admissions for nephrolithiasis and acute kidney injury. Occupational heat stress is also a risk factor for kidney dysfunction in resource-poor settings. It is unclear whether ambient heat exposure is associated with loss of kidney function in patients with established chronic kidney disease. We assessed the association between heat index and change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in participants from the DAPA-CKD trial in a post-hoc analysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      DAPA-CKD was a randomised controlled trial of oral dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or placebo that enrolled participants aged 18 years or older, with or without type 2 diabetes, with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 200-5000 mg/g, and an eGFR of 25-75 mL/min per 1·73 m2. In this post-hoc analysis, we explored the association between time-varying daily centre-level heat index (ERA5 dataset) and individual-level change in eGFR in trial participants using linear mixed effect models and case-time series. The DAPA-CKD trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03036150.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Climate and eGFR data were available for 4017 (93·3%) of 4304 participants in 21 countries (mean age: 61·9 years; mean eGFR: 43·3 mL per 1·73 m2; median 28 months follow-up). Across centres, a heat index of more than 30°C occurred on a median of 0·6% of days. In adjusted linear mixed effect models, within each 120-day window, each 30 days' heat index of more than 30°C was associated with a -0·6% (95% CI -0·9% to -0·3%) change in eGFR. Similar estimates were obtained using case-time series. Additional analyses over longer time-windows showed associations consistent with haemodynamic or seasonal variability, or both, but overall estimates corresponded to an additional 3·7 mL per 1·73 m2 (95% CI 0·1 to 7·0) loss of eGFR per year in a patient with an eGFR of 45 mL per 1·73 m2 located in a very hot versus a temperate environment.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Higher ambient heat exposure is associated with more rapid eGFR decline in those with established chronic kidney disease. Efforts to mitigate heat exposure should be tested as part of strategies to attenuate chronic kidney disease progression.

      Diabetic nephropathy is a severe complication of Type 2 diabetes. Tubular lesions may play an important role in its early stages. The aim of our study was to determine if atorvastatin protects the podocytes and the proximal tubule in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 63 patients with Type 2 diabetes completed this 6-months prospective pilot study. They were randomized to continue rosuvastatin therapy (control group) or to be administered an equipotent dose of atorvastatin (intervention group), and were assessed regarding urinary podocytes, podocyte-associated molecules, and biomarkers of proximal tubule dysfunction.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The patients from the intervention group presented a significant reduction in podocyturia (from 7.0 to 4.0 cells/ml, p < .05), urinary nephrin (from 1.7 to 1.3 mg/g, p < .001), urinary vascular endothelial growth factor (from 262.8 to 256.9, p < .01), urinary alpha1-microglobulin (from 10.0 to 8.3 mg/g, p < .01), urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (from 139.5 to 136.3 ng/g, p < .001), and urinary advanced glycation end-products (from 112.6 to 101.3 pg/ml, p < .001). Podocyturia correlated directly with the podocyte damage biomarkers, proximal tubule dysfunction biomarkers, albumin to creatinine ratio, and advanced glycation end-products, and inversely with the glomerular filtration rate.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with Type 2 diabetes, atorvastatin exerts favorable effects on the kidney. There is a correlation between the evolution of the podocytes and of the proximal tubule biomarkers, supporting the hypothesis that the glomerular changes parallel proximal tubule dysfunction in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy."

Although hepatitis A vaccine is recommended in non-immune solid organ transplant recipients who live in or travel to endemic areas, the standard 2-dose vaccination regimen demonstrated less favorable immunogenicity among these population. The 3-dose regimen showed higher response rate and immune durability in patients with human immunodeficiency virus. However, this strategy has never been studied in solid organ transplant recipients. A single-center, open-labeled, computer-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 2:1 allocation ratio was conducted from August 2017 to December 2018. The study compared the seroconversion rate after receiving 2- or 3-dose regimen of hepatitis A vaccine at 0, 6 and 0, 1, 6 months, respectively, in non-immune kidney transplant recipients. A total of 401 adult kidney transplant recipients were screened for anti-HAV IgG and 285 subjects had positive results so the seroprevalence was 71.1%. Of 116 seronegative recipients, 93 (80.2%) completed vaccination; 60 and 33 participants completed 2- and 3-dose vaccination, respectively. The baseline characteristics were comparable between both groups. The seroconversion rate at 1 month after vaccination was 51.7% in the standard 2-dose regimen and 48.5% in the 3-dose regimen (p = 0.769). Overall, the seroconversion rate appeared to be associated with high estimated glomerular infiltration rate, high serum albumin, and low intensity immunosuppressive regimen. Seroconversion rate after hepatitis A vaccination in kidney transplant recipients was less favorable than healthy population. Three-dose regimen did not show superior benefit over the standard 2-dose regimen. Other strategies of immunization may increase immunogenicity among kidney transplant recipients."

      Therapeutic blockade of the axis of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) has transformed the management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Clinical trials with pembrolizumab have enrolled patients with performance status (PS) 0-1. However, around 18% of patients with NSCLC are PS2, and the activity and safety of pembrolizumab in these patients is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in these patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We did a multicentre, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial (PePS2) in ten hospitals in the UK, in which patients with NSCLC and a rigorous ascription of PS2 were given pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. No masking was used in this trial. We stratified the treatment evaluation by tumour proportion score (TPS) and line of therapy. Co-primary outcomes were: (1) durable clinical benefit (DCB), defined as the occurrence of complete response, partial response, or stable disease that continues until at least the second CT scan scheduled at 18 weeks; and (2) toxicity, defined as the occurrence at any time of treatment-related dose delay or treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event. Analysis included all patients who received any pembrolizumab. As well as reporting simple observed incidence for the co-primary outcomes, DCB and toxicity, we also estimated incidence using a model-based method for correlated binary outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02733159; EudraCT, 2015-002241-55; and ISRCTN, 10047797.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Jan 4, 2017, and Feb 13, 2018, of 112 patients assessed for eligibility, we recruited 62 patients. 60 patients were evaluable for the co-primary outcomes. Median age was 72 years (IQR 65-75); 33 (55%) of participants were male and 27 (45%) were female. The observed incidence for DCB was 38% (95% CI 21-57) in first-line patients (n=24) and 36% (22-52) in subsequent-line patients (n=36); DCB was 22% (11-41) in patients with a TPS less than 1% (n=27), 47% (25-70) in patients with a TPS of 1-49% (n=15), and 53% (30-75) in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater (n=15). An increase in DCB incidences with TPS was also shown in model-based estimates. Toxicity was observed in 28% (95% CI 19-41) of patients, 11 (18%) of 60 due to dose delay and 6 (10%) of 60 due to drug discontinuation. No grade 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed and no early deaths were attributed to hyperprogression. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dyspnoea (n=9), hyponatraemia (n=5), and anorexia (n=4). There were ten serious adverse events considered to be related to treatment, comprising diarrhoea (n=3) and acute kidney injury, adrenal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinaemia, oral mucositis, rash, urinary tract infection, and vomiting (n=1 each).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Patients with NSCLC of PS2 are a group of patients of unmet therapeutic need. The PePS2 trial shows that pembrolizumab can be safely administered to these patients, with no increase in the risk of immune-related or other toxicities. Efficacy outcomes are at least as good as those in patients with PS0-1 and the data provides clinicians with the confidence to incorporate pembrolizumab into the treatment pathway of patients with NSCLC of PS2.

Predicting acute kidney injury at hospital re-entry using high-dimensional electronic health record data.,"Samuel J Weisenthal, Caroline Quill, Samir Farooq, Henry Kautz, Martin S Zand, Samuel J Weisenthalet al.",2018 Nov 20,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458044/,No keywords found,"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), a sudden decline in kidney function, is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and hospital cost. Since AKI is sometimes preventable, there is great interest in prediction. Most existing studies consider all patients and therefore restrict to features available in the first hours of hospitalization. Here, the focus is instead on rehospitalized patients, a cohort in which rich longitudinal features from prior hospitalizations can be analyzed. Our objective is to provide a risk score directly at hospital re-entry. Gradient boosting, penalized logistic regression (with and without stability selection), and a recurrent neural network are trained on two years of adult inpatient EHR data (3,387 attributes for 34,505 patients who generated 90,013 training samples with 5,618 cases and 84,395 controls). Predictions are internally evaluated with 50 iterations of 5-fold grouped cross-validation with special emphasis on calibration, an analysis of which is performed at the patient as well as hospitalization level. Error is assessed with respect to diagnosis, race, age, gender, AKI identification method, and hospital utilization. In an additional experiment, the regularization penalty is severely increased to induce parsimony and interpretability. Predictors identified for rehospitalized patients are also reported with a special analysis of medications that might be modifiable risk factors. Insights from this study might be used to construct a predictive tool for AKI in rehospitalized patients. An accurate estimate of AKI risk at hospital entry might serve as a prior for an admitting provider or another predictive algorithm."
Use of flash glucose monitoring system in assessing safety of the SGLT2 inhibitors during Ramadan fasting in high risk insulin treated patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Elamin Abdelgadir, Fauzia Rashid, Alaaeldin Bashier, Maryam Al Saeed, Azza Khalifa, Fatheya Alawadi, Mohamed Hassanein, Elamin Abdelgadiret al.",2019 Sep-Oct,Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31425958/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The risks of hypoglycemia, dehydration and kidney injury may theoretically be aggravated by people with type 2 diabetes treated with Insulin and SGLT2 inhibitors during Ramadan. Data on safety and efficacy of SGLT2-I in people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin is scanty. We aimed to assess the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors during Ramadan in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, on hypoglycemia, glycemic control and kidney function.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a prospective interventional study on high-risk diabetes patients who insisted on fasting. All patients were treated with insulin ± SGLT2I. All patients received a FGMS and Ramadan focused education. All patients attended clinic before and post Ramadan where they were advised on treatment modification as well as biometric and biochemical measurements.
    


          Results:
        
      
      95 patients enrolled in the study and 49 of them were on SGLT2i. There was a no significant change in creatinine in both groups. FGMS showed an improvement in the sensor-calculated HbA1c from 7.3 ± 1.5 to 6.8 ± 1.1 and from 8 ± 1.6 to 7.7 ± 1.5 in the SGLT2 group and the non-SGT2i groups, respectively. The hypoglycemia was predominantly reported during Ramadan between 12:00 to 18:00 h, while in pre-Ramadan readings was during 2400-0600 and 1200-1800 slots.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This is the first study that assesses the use of SGLT2i along with insulin during Ramadan, using FGMS in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes under optimal care. There was minimal interruption of fasting, significant improvement in glycemic control, and no significant change in the kidney function after Ramadan."
Tranexamic acid is not inferior to placebo with respect to adverse events in suspected traumatic brain injury patients not in shock with a normal head computed tomography scan: A retrospective study of a randomized trial.,"Jordan W Harmer, Elizabeth N Dewey, Eric N Meier, Susan E Rowell, Martin A Schreiber, Jordan W Harmeret al.",2022 Jul 1,J Trauma Acute Care Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35358154/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      A 2-g bolus of tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to reduce 28-day mortality in a randomized controlled trial. This study investigates whether out-of-hospital TXA use is associated with adverse events or unfavorable outcomes in suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) when intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is absent on initial computed tomography.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study used data from a 2015 to 2017, multicenter, randomized trial studying the effect of the following TXA doses on moderate to severe TBI: 2-g bolus, 1-g bolus plus 1-g infusion over 8 hours, and a placebo bolus with placebo infusion. Of the 966 participants enrolled, 395 with an initial computed tomography negative for ICH were included in this analysis. Fifteen adverse events (28-day incidence) were studied: myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, seizure, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac failure, liver failure, renal failure, cerebrovascular accident, cardiac arrest, cerebral vasospasm, ""any thromboembolism,"" hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, and infection. Other unfavorable outcomes analyzed include mortality at 28 days and 6 months, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score of ≤4 at discharge and 6 months, intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, hospital-free days, and combined unfavorable outcomes. In both study drug groups, the incidence of dichotomous outcomes and quantity of ordinal outcomes were compared with placebo.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No statistically significant increase in adverse events or unfavorable outcomes was found between either TXA dosing regimen and placebo. Demographics and injury scores were not statistically different other than two methods of injury, which were overrepresented in the 1-g TXA bolus plus 1-g TXA infusion.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Administration of either a 2-g TXA bolus or a 1-g TXA bolus plus 1-g TXA 8-hour infusion in suspected TBIs without ICH is not associated with increased adverse events or unfavorable outcomes. Because the out-of-hospital 2-g bolus is associated with a mortality benefit, it should be administered in suspected TBI.

Efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced cancer of unknown primary (CUP): a phase 2 non-randomized clinical trial.,"Kanwal P Raghav, Bettzy Stephen, Daniel D Karp, Sarina A Piha-Paul, David S Hong, Dipti Jain, Dilichukwu O Chudy Onwugaje, Abdulrahman Abonofal, Anneleis F Willett, Michael Overman, Brandon Smaglo, Ryan W Huey, Funda Meric-Bernstam, Gauri R Varadhachary, Aung Naing, Kanwal P Raghavet al.",2022 May,J Immunother Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35618285/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is an aggressive rare malignancy with limited treatment options. Data regarding clinical activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors in CUP is lacking. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death-1 inhibitor, in patients with CUP.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was designed as a phase 2 basket trial for independent rare tumor cohorts including CUP. Adult patients with CUP who had progressed on previous systemic therapy, performance status 0/1 and measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST V.1.1) were eligible. Patients received pembrolizumab (200 mg) intravenously every 21 days. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled and treated between August 2016 and June 2020. The primary endpoint was non-progression rate (NPR) at 27 weeks (NPR-27) per immune-related RECIST. Key prespecified secondary endpoints were confirmed objective response rate (ORR), safety, duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Pretreatment biopsies were examined for biomarkers of response (programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 25 (of 29 enrolled) eligible and evaluable patients, 14 (56%) had poorly differentiated carcinoma. Patients received a median of two lines of therapy prior to enrollment. Median follow-up was 27.3 months. NPR-27 was observed in seven patients (28.0% (95% CI: 12.1 to 49.4)). ORR was 20.0% (95% CI: 6.8 to 40.7) with five patients achieving immune-related partial response with median DoR of 14.7 months (95% CI: 9.8 to 19.6). Median PFS and OS were 4.1 (95% CI: 3.1 to 5.1) and 11.3 (95% CI: 5.5 to 17.1) months, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of any and grade ≥3 were seen in 19 (76%) and 4 (16%) patients, respectively. One (4%) patient had grade 3 immune-related acute kidney injury requiring treatment discontinuation. Neither PD-L1 nor TILs were associated with NPR-27. Both positive PD-L1 staining (44.4% vs 6.3%; p=0.040) and intense TIL infiltration (44.4% vs 6.3%; p=0.040) were associated with response.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Pembrolizumab showed encouraging efficacy in patients with CUP with acceptable safety profile.

Reduction in Nephrotoxic Antimicrobial Exposure Decreases Associated Acute Kidney Injury in Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Patients.,"Stefanie W Benoit, Stuart L Goldstein, Devesh S Dahale, David B Haslam, Adam Nelson, Kori Truono, Stella M Davies, Stefanie W Benoitet al.",2019 Aug,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31048085/,"Acute kidney injury, Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, Nephrotoxin, Pediatric, Quality improvement.","Exposure to nephrotoxic medications is a common risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) in pediatric stem cell transplantation (SCT). We hypothesized that reducing nephrotoxic antimicrobial exposure for SCT patients would be associated with lower nephrotoxin-associated AKI (NTMx-AKI) rates and no increase in infection treatment failures. We conducted a prospective cohort analysis of all inpatient SCT patients at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center between January 2014 and December 2017. In January 2016, first line fever coverage was changed from piperacillin-tazobactam to cefepime, acknowledging that the change resulted in a loss of enterococcal coverage, and the duration of antimicrobial exposures was limited, specifically including vancomycin. We collected data using prospective NTMx-AKI and antimicrobial utilization monitoring platforms within the electronic health record. AKI days and severity were extracted for patients exposed to 3+ nephrotoxins, 3+ days of IV aminoglycosides, or 3+ days of IV vancomycin. AKI was identified using KDIGO serum creatinine criteria. We assessed rates of nephrotoxin exposure and NTMx-AKI in all SCT inpatients for 2 years pre- and post-intervention. Data were grouped and analyzed by calendar month, normalized to a denominator of 1000 patient-days. Statistical process control methods were used to monitor adherence to the intervention and identify changes in mean rate of nephrotoxin exposure and NTMx-AKI. Infection rates, alternate antimicrobial usage rates, and the fraction of repeat positive cultures were used to identify treatment failures. PTZ usage decreased from 196 to 33 days/1000 patient days, cefepime usage increased from 62 to 290 days/1000 patient days, and vancomycin usage decreased from 62 to 41 days/1000 patient days. High nephrotoxin exposure decreased by 33% (143 to 96 days/1000 patient days), and NTMx-AKI decreased by 74% (24 to 6 days/1000 patient days). Rates of all KDIGO stages of NTMx-AKI decreased ≥50% after the intervention. Stage 3, the most severe, decreased by >80%. The fraction of repeat positive cultures remained stable between the two eras at .1 (standard deviation 0.21) and .07 (standard deviation 0.17), respectively. There were no increases in infection rates, alternate antimicrobial usage rates, or treatment failures. Reduction of nephrotoxic antimicrobial exposure can decrease the amount and severity of NTMx-AKI in SCT patients without an increase in treatment failures."
Efficacy and safety of daratumumab with ixazomib and dexamethasone in lenalidomide-exposed patients after one prior line of therapy: Final results of the phase 2 study DARIA.,"Evangelos Terpos, Ioannis Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Maria Gavriatopoulou, Eirini Katodritou, Evdoxia Hatjiharissi, Panagiotis Malandrakis, Evgenia Verrou, Stavros Golfinopoulos, Magdalini Migkou, Kyriaki Manousou, Sosana Delimpasi, Argiris Symeonidis, Efstathios Kastritis, Meletios A Dimopoulos, Evangelos Terposet al.",2024 Mar,Am J Hematol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38298023/,No keywords found,"The use of lenalidomide in frontline therapy for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) has increased the number of those who become refractory to lenalidomide at second line. In this context, we assessed the efficacy of daratumumab in combination with ixazomib and dexamethasone (Dara-Ixa-dex) in the prospective phase 2 study DARIA. Eligible patients had relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) after one prior line with a lenalidomide-based regimen. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included survival outcomes, safety and changes in biomarkers of bone metabolism. Overall, 50 patients were enrolled (median age 69 years, 56% males). 32 (64%) patients were refractory to lenalidomide, and 17 (34%) had undergone autologous transplant. The ORR was 64% (n = 32); whereas 17 (34%) had a very good partial response or better. The median time to first response was 1.0 month. After a median follow-up of 23.4 months, the median PFS and OS were 8.1 and 39.2 months, respectively. Furthermore, significant changes in markers of bone metabolism became evident as early as at 6 months on treatment. Regarding safety, 21 (42%) patients had ≥1 grade 3/4 adverse event (AE); the most common was thrombocytopenia (n = 9, 18%). 14 (28%) patients had ≥1 serious AE (SAE), the most common being acute kidney injury and pneumonia (n = 2, each). Four patients died due to infections. In conclusion, second-line treatment with Dara-Ixa-dex in patients with RRMM pre-treated with a lenalidomide-based regimen resulted in rapid responses along with a favorable effect on bone metabolism."
Early calcineurin-inhibitor to belatacept conversion in steroid-free kidney transplant recipients.,"Ibrahim Tawhari, Patrick Hallak, Sofia Bin, Fatmah Yamani, Maria Safar-Boueri, Aazib Irshad, Joseph Leventhal, Mohammed Javeed Ansari, Paolo Cravedi, Lorenzo Gallon, Ibrahim Tawhariet al.",2022 Dec 19:13:1096881.,Front Immunol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36601111/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Belatacept (Bela) was developed to reduce nephrotoxicity and cardiovascular risk that are associated with the chronic use of Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) in kidney transplant recipients. The use of Bela with early steroid withdrawal (ESW) and simultaneous CNI avoidance has not been formally evaluated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      At 3 months post-transplant, stable kidney transplant recipients with ESW on Tacrolimus (Tac) + mycophenolate (MPA) were randomized 1:1:1 to: 1) Bela+MPA, 2) Bela+low-dose Tac (trough goal <5 ng/mL), or 3) continue Tac+MPA. All patients underwent surveillance graft biopsies at enrollment and then at 12, and 24 months post-transplant. Twenty-seven recipients were included; 9 underwent conversion to Bela+MPA, 8 to Bela+low-dose Tac and 10 continued Tac+MPA. Serial blood samples were collected for immune phenotyping and gene expression analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The Bela+MPA arm was closed early due to high rate of biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR). The incidence of BPAR was 4/9 in Bela+MPA, 0/8 in Bela+low dose Tac and 2/10 in Tac+MPA, P= 0.087. The Bela+low-dose Tac regimen was associated with +8.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 increase in eGFR compared to -0.38 mL/min/1.73 m2 in Tac+MPA, P= 0.243. One graft loss occurred in the Bela+MPA group. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood monocyte count (PBMC) showed that CD28+CD4+ and CD28+CD8+ T cells were higher in Bela+MPA patients with acute rejection compared to patients without rejection, although the difference did not reach statistical significance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our data indicate that, in steroid free regimens, low-dose Tac maintenance is needed to prevent rejection when patients are converted to Bela, at least when the maneuver is done early after transplant."

      Tolerance induction is an important goal in the field of organ transplantation. We have sequentially modified our conditioning regimen for induction of donor-specific tolerance in recipients of major histocompatibility complex-mismatched combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      From December 2011 to May 2017, 8 major histocompatibility complex-mismatched patients received CKBMT. The initial conditioning regimen (protocol 1) consisted of cyclophosphamide (CP), rituximab, rabbit antithymocyte globulin, and thymic irradiation. Tacrolimus and steroids were used for the maintenance of immunosuppression (IS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      This regimen was complicated by transient acute kidney injury, which has been the major clinical feature of engraftment syndrome and side effects of CP, although one of 2 subjects successfully discontinued his IS for 14 months. The conditioning regimen was modified by reducing the CP dose and adding fludarabine (protocol 2). The final modification was reducing the fludarabine and rabbit antithymocyte globulin doses (protocol 3). Mixed chimerism, detected by the short tandem repeat method, was achieved transiently in all subjects for 3-20 weeks. Among the 3 subjects treated with protocol 2, IS was successfully discontinued for >35 months in one subject, but the other 2 subjects suffered from severe BK virus-associated nephritis. All 3 subjects treated with protocol 3 tolerated the protocol well and have successfully discontinued IS for >4-41 months. Interestingly, de novo donor-specific antibody was not detected in any subject during all the follow-up periods.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our clinical trial has shown that long-term renal allograft survival without maintenance IS can be achieved by induction of mixed chimerism following CKBMT."

      The Acute Kidney Outreach to Reduce Deterioration and Death trial was a large pilot study for a cluster-randomized trial of acute kidney injury (AKI) outreach.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An observational control (before) phase was conducted in two teaching hospitals (9 miles apart) and their respective catchment areas. In the intervention (after) phase, a working-hours AKI outreach service operated for the intervention hospital/area for 20 weeks, with the other site acting as a control. All AKI alerts in both hospital and community patients were screened for inclusion. Major exclusion criteria were patients who were at the end of life, unlikely to benefit from outreach, lacking mental capacity or already referred to the renal team. The intervention arm included a model of escalation of renal care to AKI patients, depending on AKI stage. The 30-day primary outcome was a combination of death, or deterioration, as shown by any need for dialysis or progression in AKI stage. A total of 1762 adult patients were recruited; 744 at the intervention site during the after phase.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A median of 3.0 non-medication recommendations and 0.5 medication-related recommendations per patient were made by the outreach team a median of 15.7 h after the AKI alert. Relatively low rates of the primary outcomes of death within 30 days (11-15%) or requirement for dialysis (0.4-3.7%) were seen across all four groups. In an exploratory analysis, at the intervention hospital during the after phase, there was an odds ratio for the combined primary outcome of 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.42-1.26; P = 0.26).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      An AKI outreach service can provide standardized specialist care to those with AKI across a healthcare economy. Trials assessing AKI outreach may benefit from focusing on those patients with 'mid-range' prognosis, where nephrological intervention could have the most impact."

      Switching from boosted PIs to dolutegravir in people living with HIV (PLWH) with high cardiovascular risk improved plasma lipids at 48 weeks in the NEAT022 trial. Whether this strategy may have an impact on cardiovascular biomarkers is unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We assessed 48 week changes in biomarkers associated with inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, monocyte immune activation, oxidation, insulin resistance, hypercoagulability, heart failure, myocardial injury, and glomerular and tubular kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 415 PLWH randomized in the NEAT022 study, 313 (75.4%) remained on allocated therapy and had paired samples available. Soluble CD14 (-11%, P < 0.001) and adiponectin (-11%, P < 0.001) significantly declined and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (-13%, P = 0.069) and oxidized LDL (-13%, P = 0.084) tended to decrease with dolutegravir. Switching to dolutegravir remained significantly associated with soluble CD14 and adiponectin reductions after adjustment for baseline variables. There were inverse correlations between soluble CD14 and CD4 count changes (P = 0.05), and between adiponectin and BMI changes (P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Switching from boosted PIs to dolutegravir in PLWH with high cardiovascular risk led to soluble CD14 and adiponectin reductions at 48 weeks. While decreasing soluble CD14 may entail favourable health effects in PLWH, adiponectin reduction may reflect less insulin sensitivity associated with weight gain."

      Concern for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) may result in administration of more costly agents. We prospectively compared outpatient CIN incidence of iodixanol to iohexol.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients were randomized to receive 100ml of iohexol (n=47) or iodixanol (n=55). We compared patients who developed CIN using the Wilson score interval and also calculated an odds ratio for the development of CIN.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CIN rate for iohexol was 2% compared to 9% for iodixanol. Those receiving iodixanol were almost 5 times more likely to experience CIN.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These results do not suggest a benefit of iodixanol over iohexol in the study population."

      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 70 deceased-donor KT recipients ( www.irct.ir , trial registration number: IRCT2014090214693N4). Patients received 600 mg oral NAC or placebo twice daily from day 0 to 5 and urine samples were taken before, and on the first and fifth days after transplantation. U-NGAL and early graft function were compared between the two groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      NAC significantly reduced u-NGAL levels compared to placebo (p value = 0.02), while improvement in early graft function with NAC did not reach statistical significance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study showed that NAC administration in deceased-donor KT recipients can reduce tubular kidney injury, evidenced by u-NGAL measurements. Improvement in early graft function needs a larger sample size to reach a statistical conclusion."
Development of real-time individualized risk prediction models for contrast associated acute kidney injury and 30-day dialysis after contrast enhanced computed tomography.,"Yen-Yu Chen, Chung-Feng Liu, Yu-Ting Shen, Yu-Ting Kuo, Ching-Chung Ko, Tai-Yuan Chen, Te-Chang Wu, Yun-Ju Shih, Yen-Yu Chenet al.",2023 Oct:167:111034.,Eur J Radiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37591134/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      This study aimed to develop preprocedural real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems for predicting individualized risks of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) and dialysis requirement within 30 days following contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT).
    


          Method:
        
      
      This single-center, retrospective study analyzed adult patients from emergency or in-patient departments who underwent CECT; 18,895 patients were included after excluding those who were already on dialysis, had stage V chronic kidney disease, or had missing data regarding serum creatinine levels within 7 days before and after CECT. Clinical parameters, laboratory data, medication exposure, and comorbid diseases were selected as predictive features. The patients were randomly divided into model training and testing groups at a 7:3 ratio. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were employed to create prediction models, which were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence rates of CA-AKI and dialysis within 30 days post-CECT were 6.69% and 0.98%, respectively. For CA-AKI prediction, LR and RF exhibited similar performance, with areas under curve (AUCs) of 0.769 and 0.757, respectively. For 30-day dialysis prediction, LR (AUC, 0.863) and RF (AUC, 0.872) also exhibited similar performance. Relative to eGFR-alone, the LR and RF models produced significantly higher AUCs for CA-AKI prediction (LR vs. eGFR alone, 0.769 vs. 0.626, p < 0.001) and 30-day dialysis prediction (RF vs. eGFR alone, 0.872 vs. 0.738, p < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The proposed AI prediction models significantly outperformed eGFR-alone for predicting the CA-AKI and 30-day dialysis risks of emergency department and hospitalized patients who underwent CECT."
Urinary Biomarkers of Tubular Damage Are Associated with Mortality but Not Cardiovascular Risk among Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial Participants with Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Vasantha K Jotwani, Alexandra K Lee, Michelle M Estrella, Ronit Katz, Pranav S Garimella, Rakesh Malhotra, Dena E Rifkin, Walter Ambrosius, Barry I Freedman, Alfred K Cheung, Kalani L Raphael, Paul Drawz, Javier A Neyra, Suzanne Oparil, Henry Punzi, Michael G Shlipak, Joachim H Ix                                                            ;, fortheSPRINTResearchGroup, Vasantha K Jotwaniet al.",2019,Am J Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30939472/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis on biopsy is a strong predictor of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, and CKD is associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Tubular health is poorly quantified by traditional kidney function measures, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. We hypothesized that urinary biomarkers of tubular injury, inflammation, and repair would be associated with higher risk of CVD and mortality in persons with CKD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We measured urinary concentrations of interleukin-18 (IL-18), kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and chitinase-3-like protein-1 (YKL-40) at baseline among 2,377 participants of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial who had an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate biomarker associations with CVD events and all-cause mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At baseline, the mean age of participants was 72 ± 9 years, and eGFR was 48 ± 11 mL/min/1.73 m2. Over a median follow-up of 3.8 years, 305 CVD events (3.6% per year) and 233 all-cause deaths (2.6% per year) occurred. After multivariable adjustment including eGFR, albuminuria, and urinary creatinine, none of the biomarkers showed statistically significant associations with CVD risk. Urinary IL-18 (hazard ratio [HR] per 2-fold higher value, 1.14; 95% CI 1.01-1.29) and YKL-40 (HR per 2-fold higher value, 1.08; 95% CI 1.02-1.14) concentrations were each incrementally associated with higher mortality risk. Associations were similar when stratified by randomized blood pressure arm.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among hypertensive trial participants with CKD, higher urinary IL-18 and YKL-40 were associated with higher risk of mortality, but not CVD."

      To investigate effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4I) sitagliptin or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide treatment on renal hemodynamics, tubular functions, and markers of renal damage in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes without chronic kidney disease (CKD).
    


          Research design and methods:
        
      
      In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind trial, 55 insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes (mean ± SEM: age 63 ± 7 years, BMI 31.8 ± 4.1 kg/m2, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] 83 ± 16 mL/min/1.73 m2; median [interquartile range]: albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) 1.09 mg/mmol [0.47-3.31]) received sitagliptin (100 mg/day), liraglutide (1.8 mg/day), or matching placebos. GFR (primary end point) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined by inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearance, respectively. Intrarenal hemodynamic variables were estimated. Absolute and fractional excretions of sodium (FENa), potassium, and urea (FEU) and renal damage markers (ACR, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL], and kidney injury molecule-1 [KIM-1]) were measured. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were assessed. At weeks 2 and 6, estimated GFR and fractional electrolyte excretions were determined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At week 12, GFR was not affected by sitagliptin (-6 mL/min/1.73 m2 [95% CI -14 to 3], P = 0.17) or liraglutide (+3 mL/min/1.73 m2 [-5 to 11], P = 0.46), compared with placebo. Sitagliptin modestly reduced estimated glomerular hydraulic pressure (PGLO; P = 0.043). ERPF, other intrarenal hemodynamic variables, renal damage markers, and PRC did not change for both treatments. Both agents reduced HbA1c. Only at week 2, sitagliptin increased FENa and FEU (P = 0.005).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Twelve-week treatment with sitagliptin or liraglutide does not affect measured renal hemodynamics. No sustained changes in tubular functions or alteration in renal damage markers were observed. The validity and clinical relevance of the slight sitagliptin-induced PGLO reduction remains speculative."
"A Phase I study to determine the pharmacokinetic profile, safety and tolerability of sildenafil (Revatio® ) in cardiac surgery: the REVAKI-1 study.","Arne Ring, Tom Morris, Marcin Wozniak, Nikol Sullo, William Dott, Veerle Verheyden, Tracy Kumar, Nigel Brunskill, Rakesh Vaja, Gavin J Murphy, Arne Ringet al.",2017 Apr,Br J Clin Pharmacol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27779776/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe complication of cardiac surgery. There is no effective prevention or treatment. Sildenafil citrate (Revatio® , Pfizer Inc.), a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, prevents post cardiac surgery AKI in pre-clinical studies, however its use is contraindicated in patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous sildenafil in cardiac surgery patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted an open label, dose escalation study with six patients per dose level. The six doses were 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg as a bolus, either alone or followed by an additional 2 h infusion of 2.5 mg sildenafil.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-six patients entered the trial, of which 33 completed it. The mean age was 69.9 years. One patient died during surgery, two others were removed from the trial before dosing (all at dose level 5 mg + 2.5 mg). The pharmacokinetic profile of sildenafil was similar to previously published studies. For a dose of 10 mg administered as a bolus followed by 2.5 mg administered over 2 h the results were AUC∞ 537 ng h ml-1 , Cmax 189.4 ng ml-1 and t1/2 10.5 h. The drug was well tolerated with no serious adverse events related to drug administration. Higher sildenafil doses stabilized post-surgery nitric oxide bioavailability.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pharmacokinetics of sildenafil during cardiopulmonary bypass were comparable to those of other patient groups. The drug was well tolerated at therapeutic plasma levels. These results support the further evaluation of sildenafil for the prevention of AKI in cardiac surgery."

      Despite multimodal therapy, 5-year overall survival for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is about 50%. We assessed the addition of pembrolizumab to concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced HNSCC.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In the randomised, double-blind, phase 3 KEYNOTE-412 trial, participants with newly diagnosed, high-risk, unresected locally advanced HNSCC from 130 medical centres globally were randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab (200 mg) plus chemoradiotherapy or placebo plus chemoradiotherapy. Randomisation was done using an interactive response technology system and was stratified by investigator's choice of radiotherapy regimen, tumour site and p16 status, and disease stage, with participants randomly assigned in blocks of four per stratum. Participants, investigators, and sponsor personnel were masked to treatment assignments. Local pharmacists were aware of assignments to support treatment preparation. Pembrolizumab and placebo were administered intravenously once every 3 weeks for up to 17 doses (one before chemoradiotherapy, two during chemoradiotherapy, 14 as maintenance therapy). Chemoradiotherapy included cisplatin (100 mg/m2) administered intravenously once every 3 weeks for two or three doses and accelerated or standard fractionation radiotherapy (70 Gy delivered in 35 fractions). The primary endpoint was event-free survival analysed in all randomly assigned participants. Safety was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03040999, and is active but not recruiting.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between April 19, 2017, and May 2, 2019, 804 participants were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab group (n=402) or the placebo group (n=402). 660 (82%) of 804 participants were male, 144 (18%) were female, and 622 (77%) were White. Median study follow-up was 47·7 months (IQR 42·1-52·3). Median event-free survival was not reached (95% CI 44·7 months-not reached) in the pembrolizumab group and 46·6 months (27·5-not reached) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·83 [95% CI 0·68-1·03]; log-rank p=0·043 [significance threshold, p≤0·024]). 367 (92%) of 398 participants treated in the pembrolizumab group and 352 (88%) of 398 participants treated in the placebo group had grade 3 or worse adverse events. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (108 [27%] of 398 participants in the pembrolizumab group vs 100 [25%] of 398 participants in the placebo group), stomatitis (80 [20%] vs 69 [17%]), anaemia (80 [20%] vs 61 [15%]), dysphagia (76 [19%] vs 62 [16%]), and decreased lymphocyte count (76 [19%] vs 81 [20%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 245 (62%) participants in the pembrolizumab group versus 197 (49%) participants in the placebo group, most commonly pneumonia (43 [11%] vs 25 [6%]), acute kidney injury (33 [8%] vs 30 [8%]), and febrile neutropenia (24 [6%] vs seven [2%]). Treatment-related adverse events led to death in four (1%) participants in the pembrolizumab group (one participant each from aspiration pneumonia, end-stage renal disease, pneumonia, and sclerosing cholangitis) and six (2%) participants in the placebo group (three participants from pharyngeal haemorrhage and one participant each from mouth haemorrhage, post-procedural haemorrhage, and sepsis).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Pembrolizumab plus chemoradiotherapy did not significantly improve event-free survival compared with chemoradiotherapy alone in a molecularly unselected, locally advanced HNSCC population. No new safety signals were seen. Locally advanced HNSCC remains a challenging disease that requires better treatment approaches.

The effect of regional citrate anti-coagulation on the coagulation system in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury - an observational cohort study.,"Richard Fisher, Katie Lei, Mike J Mitchell, Gary W Moore, Helen Dickie, Linda Tovey, Siobhan Crichton, Marlies Ostermann, Richard Fisheret al.",2017 Oct 2,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969597/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Regional anticoagulation with citrate is the recommended first line treatment for patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). There is wide variability in filter patency which may be due to differences in patient characteristics and local practice. It is also possible that citrate has effects on primary and secondary haemostasis, fibrinolysis and platelet function that are still unknown. The primary aim of the study is to describe the effect of citrate on coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways in both the patient and the haemodialysis circuit.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study will recruit 12 adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit, requiring CRRT with regional citrate anticoagulation for acute kidney injury. Patients with pre-existing thrombotic or bleeding tendencies will be excluded. Thrombin generation, clot lysis and platelet function will be measured at baseline and at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h after commencing CRRT (from the patient and from the circuit). We will describe the evolution of parameters over time as well as the differences in parameters between the patient and the circuit.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The study will provide new data on the effects of citrate during continuous renal replacement therapy which is not currently available. We will minimise confounding factors through the use of tight exclusion criteria and accept that this will slow down recruitment. Depending on the results, we hope to incorporate the findings into existing clinical guidelines and clinical practice with the aim to prevent premature filter clotting and interruptions in treatment.

      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) causes irreversible loss of lung function. People with IPF have increased concentrations of autotaxin in lung tissue and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and exhaled condensate. GLPG1690 (Galapagos, Mechelen, Belgium) is a novel, potent, selective autotaxin inhibitor with good oral exposure. We explored the effects of GLPG1690 in patients with IPF.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a study done in 17 centres in Italy, Ukraine and the UK. Eligible patients were aged 40 years or older, non-smokers, not taking pirfenidone or nintedanib, and had a centrally confirmed diagnosis of IPF. We used a computer-generated randomisation schedule to assign patients 1:3 to receive placebo or 600 mg oral GLPG1690 once daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were safety (adverse events), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Spirometry was assessed as a secondary outcome. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02738801.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between March 24, 2016, and May 2, 2017, 72 patients were screened., of whom 49 were ineligible and 23 were enrolled in eight centres (six in Ukraine and two in the UK). Six patients were assigned to receive placebo and 17 to receive GLPG1690. 20 patients completed the study after one in each group discontinued because of adverse events and one in the GLPG1690 group withdrew consent. Four (67%) patients in the placebo group and 11 (65%) in the GLPG1690 group had treatment-emergent adverse events, most of which were mild to moderate. The most frequent events in the GLPG1690 group were infections and infestations (ten events) and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (eight events) with no apparent differences from the placebo group. Two (12%) patients in the GLPG1690 group had events that were judged to be related to treatment. Serious adverse events were seen in two patients in the placebo group (one had a urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, and lower respiratory tract infection and the other had atrioventricular block, second degree) and one in the GLPG1690 group (cholangiocarcinoma that resulted in discontinuation of treatment). No patients died. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of GLPG1690 were similar to those previously shown in healthy controls. LPA C18:2 concentrations in plasma were consistently decreased. Mean change from baseline in forced vital capacity at week 12 was 25 mL (95% CI -75 to 124) for GLPG1690 and -70 mL (-208 to 68 mL) for placebo.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Our findings support further development of GLPG1690 as a novel treatment for IPF.

Double-blind randomized controlled trial of the routine perioperative use of terlipressin in adult living donor liver transplantation.,"Mettu Srinivas Reddy, Ilankumaran Kaliamoorthy, Akila Rajakumar, Selvakumar Malleeshwaran, Ellango Appuswamy, Sukanya Lakshmi, Joy Varghese, Mohamed Rela, Mettu Srinivas Reddyet al.",2017 Aug,Liver Transpl,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28294557/,No keywords found,"Perioperative terlipressin (Tp) during living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been shown to reduce intraoperative portal pressures and improve renal function. Its role and safety profile have never been evaluated in a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). The aim was to evaluate the hemodynamic effects, clinical benefits, and safety of perioperative Tp infusion in adult LDLT. This was a single-center double-blind RCT. Consenting adults with chronic liver disease and low risk of posttransplant renal dysfunction undergoing their first LDLT were randomized. The study group (terlipressin group [TpG]) received an initial bolus of Tp during surgery followed by a Tp infusion for 72 hours in the postoperative period. The placebo group (PbG) received a saline infusion. The primary endpoint was portal pressure after arterial reperfusion. Multiple intraoperative and postoperative variables served as secondary endpoints. A total of 41 patients were enrolled in the trial (TpG, 21; PbG, 20). There were no significant differences in intraoperative portal pressures, blood loss, fluid requirement, vasopressor requirement, or urine output. Peak intraoperative and end of surgery lactate levels were significantly higher in the Tp group. There was no difference in postoperative liver function tests. Incidence of acute kidney injury as assessed by Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-Stage Kidney Disease criteria was lower in the Tp group (27% versus 60%; P = 0.04). The TpG had less postoperative ascites, a lower need for percutaneous interventions, and a shorter hospital stay. Incidence of bradycardia requiring pharmacological intervention and withdrawal from study was significantly higher in the TpG. In conclusion, this study has not demonstrated a reduction in postreperfusion portal pressure with Tp. However, Tp infusion reduced postoperative ascitic drain output resulting in less frequent percutaneous interventions and reduced hospital stay. Intraoperative hyperlactatemia and symptomatic bradycardia are major concerns. Its use should be restricted to patients with high-volume ascites, and it needs close monitoring during drug infusion.

      JAVELIN Lung 200 was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at 173 hospitals and cancer treatment centres in 31 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had stage IIIB or IV or recurrent NSCLC and disease progression after treatment with a platinum-containing doublet, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, an estimated life expectancy of more than 12 weeks, and adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice-response system with a stratified permuted block method with variable block length, to receive either avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression (≥1% vs <1% of tumour cells), which was measured with the 73-10 assay, and histology (squamous vs non-squamous). The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed when roughly 337 events (deaths) had occurred in the PD-L1-positive population. Efficacy was analysed in all PD-L1-positive patients (ie, PD-L1 expression in ≥1% of tumour cells) randomly assigned to study treatment (the primary analysis population) and then in all randomly assigned patients through a hierarchical testing procedure. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02395172. Enrolment is complete, but the trial is ongoing.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between March 24, 2015, and Jan 23, 2017, 792 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive avelumab (n=396) or docetaxel (n=396). 264 participants in the avelumab group and 265 in the docetaxel group had PD-L1-positive tumours. In patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, median overall survival did not differ significantly between the avelumab and docetaxel groups (11·4 months [95% CI 9·4-13·9] vs 10·3 months [8·5-13·0]; hazard ratio 0·90 [96% CI 0·72-1·12]; one-sided p=0·16). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 251 (64%) of 393 avelumab-treated patients and 313 (86%) of 365 docetaxel-treated patients, including grade 3-5 events in 39 (10%) and 180 (49%) patients, respectively. The most common grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were infusion-related reaction (six patients [2%]) and increased lipase (four [1%]) in the avelumab group and neutropenia (51 [14%]), febrile neutropenia (37 [10%]), and decreased neutrophil counts (36 [10%]) in the docetaxel group. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 34 (9%) patients in the avelumab group and 75 (21%) in the docetaxel group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four (1%) participants in the avelumab group, two due to interstitial lung disease, one due to acute kidney injury, and one due to a combination of autoimmune myocarditis, acute cardiac failure, and respiratory failure. Treatment-related deaths occurred in 14 (4%) patients in the docetaxel group, three due to pneumonia, and one each due to febrile neutropenia, septic shock, febrile neutropenia with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, cardiovascular insufficiency, renal impairment, leucopenia with mucosal inflammation and pyrexia, infection, neutropenic infection, dehydration, and unknown causes.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Compared with docetaxel, avelumab did not improve overall survival in patients with platinum-treated PD-L1-positive NSCLC, but had a favourable safety profile.

Patient Selection for Intensive Blood Pressure Management Based on Benefit and Adverse Events.,"Adam P Bress, Tom Greene, Catherine G Derington, Jincheng Shen, Yizhe Xu, Yiyi Zhang, Jian Ying, Brandon K Bellows, William C Cushman, Paul K Whelton, Nicholas M Pajewski, David Reboussin, Srinivasan Beddu, Rachel Hess, Jennifer S Herrick, Zugui Zhang, Paul Kolm, Robert W Yeh, Sanjay Basu, William S Weintraub, Andrew E Moran                              ;, SPRINT Research Group, Adam P Bresset al.",2021 Apr 27,J Am Coll Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33888247/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment prevents cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in patients with high CVD risk on average, though benefits likely vary among patients.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to predict the magnitude of benefit (reduced CVD and all-cause mortality risk) along with adverse event (AE) risk from intensive versus standard SBP treatment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a secondary analysis of SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial). Separate benefit outcomes were the first occurrence of: 1) a CVD composite of acute myocardial infarction or other acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, or CVD death; and 2) all-cause mortality. Treatment-related AEs of interest included hypotension, syncope, bradycardia, electrolyte abnormalities, injurious falls, and acute kidney injury. Modified elastic net Cox regression was used to predict absolute risk for each outcome and absolute risk differences on the basis of 36 baseline variables available at the point of care with intensive versus standard treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 8,828 SPRINT participants (mean age 67.9 years, 35% women), 600 CVD composite events, 363 all-cause deaths, and 481 treatment-related AEs occurred over a median follow-up period of 3.26 years. Individual participant risks were predicted for the CVD composite (C index = 0.71), all-cause mortality (C index = 0.75), and treatment-related AEs (C index = 0.69). Higher baseline CVD risk was associated with greater benefit (i.e., larger absolute CVD risk reduction). Predicted CVD benefit and predicted increased treatment-related AE risk were correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.72), and 95% of participants who fell into the highest tertile of predicted benefit also had high or moderate predicted increases in treatment-related AE risk. Few were predicted as high benefit with low AE risk (1.8%) or low benefit with high AE risk (1.5%). Similar results were obtained for all-cause mortality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      SPRINT participants with higher baseline predicted CVD risk gained greater absolute benefit from intensive treatment. Participants with high predicted benefit were also most likely to experience treatment-related AEs, but AEs were generally mild and transient. Patients should be prioritized for intensive SBP treatment on the basis of higher predicted benefit. (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial [SPRINT]; NCT01206062)."
Effect of Ascorbic Acid on Postoperative Acute Kidney Injury in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patients: A Pilot Study.,"Miha Antonic, Miha Antonic.",2017 Oct 24,Heart Surg Forum,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29087285/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Even minor postoperative reductions in renal function influence the outcome of cardiac surgery. The mechanisms of postoperative renal injury in cardiac surgery are multifactorial and include ischemia-reperfusion injury. The study investigates the effect of the antioxidant ascorbic acid on the postoperative acute kidney injury after elective CABG surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective randomized single-center trial was conducted in on-pump coronary artery bypass patients. The patients in the ascorbic acid group received 2 grams of ascorbic acid 24 hours and 2 hours preoperatively and 1 gram twice daily five days after the surgery. Postoperatively, the subjects were monitored for renal dysfunction and other complications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      100 patients were included, with 50 patients in each study group. The groups were well matched for baseline demographics, preoperative medications, comorbidities, and had similar intraoperative characteristics. The incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury in the ascorbic acid group was 16% and 14% in the control group (P = .779). The groups also did not differ in peak postoperative serum creatinine (83 [33] µmol/L versus 83 [39] µmol/L; P = .434), the lowest postoperative creatinine clearance (96.40 ± 35.78 mL/min versus 90.89 ± 36.18 mL/min; P = .766), and time from surgery to the onset of peak postoperative serum creatinine (1.64 ± 1.34 days versus 1.92 ± 1.54 days; P = .393). There was no dialysis required in any patient. Conclusion: The results of this study did not demonstrate a significant protective effect of ascorbic acid on the incidence of postoperative acute renal injury in elective on-pump CABG patients."
Fluids in Sepsis and Septic Shock (FISSH): protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial.,"Bram Rochwerg, Tina Millen, Peggy Austin, Michelle Zeller, Frédérick D'Aragon, Roman Jaeschke, Marie-Hélène Masse, Sangeeta Mehta, Francois Lamontagne, Maureen Meade, Gordon Guyatt, Deborah J Cook                                                            ;, Canadian Critical Care Trials Group, Bram Rochwerget al.",2017 Jul 20,BMJ Open,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28729329/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Observational evidence suggests physiological benefits and lower mortality with lower chloride solutions; however, 0.9% saline remains the most widely used fluid worldwide. Given uncertainty regarding the association of lower chloride on mortality, it is unlikely that practice will change without direct randomised clinical trial (RCT) evidence. This pilot RCT will investigate the feasibility of a large-scale trial directly comparing low chloride with high chloride fluids in patients with septic shock.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      This is a randomised, concealed, blinded parallel-group multicentre pilot trial. We will include adult critically ill patients with septic shock, defined as ongoing hypotension despite 1 L of fluid, or a serum lactate >4 mmol/L, who are within 6 hours of hospital presentation or rapid response team activation. We will exclude patients if they have an aetiology of shock other than sepsis, if they have acute burn injury, elevated intracranial pressure, intent to withdraw life support or previous enrolment in this or a competing trial. Following informed consent, patients will be randomised to a low chloride fluid strategy or a high chloride fluid strategy for the duration of their ICU stay or until 30 days postrandomisation. Clinicians, patients, families and research staff will be blinded. The primary outcome for this trial will be feasibility, assessed by consent rate, recruitment success and protocol adherence. Patient-important clinical outcomes include mortality, receipt of renal replacement therapy, intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay and surrogate outcomes of incidence of acidosis, hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      This pilot trial will test the feasibility of conducting the main trial, which will examine the effect of high versus low chloride fluids in patients with septic shock on patient-important outcomes.

Effect of Reduced Exposure to Vasopressors on 90-Day Mortality in Older Critically Ill Patients With Vasodilatory Hypotension: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"François Lamontagne, Alvin Richards-Belle, Karen Thomas, David A Harrison, M Zia Sadique, Richard D Grieve, Julie Camsooksai, Robert Darnell, Anthony C Gordon, Doreen Henry, Nicholas Hudson, Alexina J Mason, Michelle Saull, Chris Whitman, J Duncan Young, Kathryn M Rowan, Paul R Mouncey                              ;, trial investigators, François Lamontagneet al.",2020 Mar 10,JAMA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32049269/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Vasopressors are commonly administered to intensive care unit (ICU) patients to raise blood pressure. Balancing risks and benefits of vasopressors is a challenge, particularly in older patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether reducing exposure to vasopressors through permissive hypotension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] target, 60-65 mm Hg) reduces mortality at 90 days in ICU patients aged 65 years or older with vasodilatory hypotension.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      A multicenter, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 65 ICUs in the United Kingdom and included 2600 randomized patients aged 65 years or older with vasodilatory hypotension (assessed by treating clinician). The study was conducted from July 2017 to March 2019, and follow-up was completed in August 2019.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were randomized 1:1 to vasopressors guided either by MAP target (60-65 mm Hg, permissive hypotension) (n = 1291) or according to usual care (at the discretion of treating clinicians) (n = 1307).
    


          Main outcome and measures:
        
      
      The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 2600 randomized patients, after removal of those who declined or had withdrawn consent, 2463 (95%) were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (mean [SD] age 75 years [7 years]; 1387 [57%] men). Patients randomized to the permissive hypotension group had lower exposure to vasopressors compared with those in the usual care group (median duration 33 hours vs 38 hours; difference in medians, -5.0; 95% CI, -7.8 to -2.2 hours; total dose in norepinephrine equivalents median, 17.7 mg vs 26.4 mg; difference in medians, -8.7 mg; 95% CI, -12.8 to -4.6 mg). At 90 days, 500 of 1221 (41.0%) in the permissive hypotension compared with 544 of 1242 (43.8%) in the usual care group had died (absolute risk difference, -2.85%; 95% CI, -6.75 to 1.05; P = .15) (unadjusted relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85-1.03). When adjusted for prespecified baseline variables, the odds ratio for 90-day mortality was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.98). Serious adverse events were reported for 79 patients (6.2%) in the permissive care group and 75 patients (5.8%) in the usual care group. The most common serious adverse events were acute renal failure (41 [3.2%] vs 33 [2.5%]) and supraventricular cardiac arrhythmia (12 [0.9%] vs 13 [1.0%]).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients 65 years or older receiving vasopressors for vasodilatory hypotension, permissive hypotension compared with usual care did not result in a statistically significant reduction in mortality at 90 days. However, the confidence interval around the point estimate for the primary outcome should be considered when interpreting the clinical importance of the study.

The effect of low-dose furosemide in critically ill patients with early acute kidney injury: A pilot randomized blinded controlled trial (the SPARK study).,"Sean M Bagshaw, R T Noel Gibney, Peter Kruger, Imran Hassan, Finlay A McAlister, Rinaldo Bellomo, Sean M Bagshawet al.",2017 Dec:42:138-146.,J Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28732314/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Furosemide is commonly prescribed in acute kidney injury (AKI). Prior studies have found conflicting findings on whether furosemide modifies the course and outcome of AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Pilot multi-center randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with AKI admitted to three intensive care units. Participants were randomly allocated to furosemide bolus and infusion or 0.9% saline placebo. Primary endpoint was worsening AKI, defined by the RIFLE criteria. Secondary endpoints were kidney recovery, renal replacement therapy (RRT) and adverse events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial was terminated after enrollment of 73 participants (37 to furosemide and 36 to placebo). Mean (SD) age was 61.7 (14.3), 79.5% were medical admissions, mean (SD) APACHE II score was 26.6 (7.8), 90.4% received mechanical ventilation and 61.6% received vasoactives. Groups were similar at baseline. No differences were found in the proportion with worsening AKI (43.2% vs. 37.1%, p=0.6), kidney recovery (29.7% vs. 42.9%, p=0.3), or RRT (27.0% s. 28.6%, p=0.8). Adverse events, mostly electrolyte abnormalities, were more common in furosemide-treated patients (p<0.001). Protocol deviations were common, due often to supplementary furosemide.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this pilot trial, furosemide did not reduce the rate of worsening AKI, improve recovery or reduce RRT; however, was associated with greater electrolyte abnormalities.

Continuous intravenous infusion of nicorandil for 4 hours before and 24 hours after percutaneous coronary intervention protects against contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with poor renal function.,"Takahide Nawa, Kazuhiko Nishigaki, Yujiro Kinomura, Toshiki Tanaka, Yoshihisa Yamada, Masanori Kawasaki, Shinya Minatoguchi, Takahide Nawaet al.",2015 Sep 15:195:228-34.,Int J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26048382/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      We conducted a prospective randomized trial to assess the protective effect of continuous intravenous infusion of nicorandil against contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with poor renal function.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      We randomly assigned 213 patients who would subsequently undergo elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and who had a high serum cystatin C level to a saline group (n=107) or a nicorandil group (n=106, nicorandil infused in addition to saline for 4h before and 24h after PCI). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. However, the average percent increases in serum creatinine and cystatin C following PCI were significantly smaller in the nicorandil group than the saline group. Likewise, the average percent decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was smaller in the nicorandil group. Correspondingly, the incidence of CIN was dramatically lower in the nicorandil group than the saline group (2.0% vs. 10.7%, p<0.02). Univariate regression analysis revealed nicorandil treatment to be the only significant predictor of CIN development (odds ratio: 0.173, 95% confidence interval: 0.037-0.812, p=0.026).
    


          Conclusions:

"Efficacy and safety of antimicrobial stewardship prospective audit and feedback in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 (COVASP): a pragmatic, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority trial.","Justin Z Chen, Holly L Hoang, Maryna Yaskina, Dima Kabbani, Karen E Doucette, Stephanie W Smith, Cecilia Lau, Jackson Stewart, Shahileen Remtulla, Karen Zurek, Morgan Schultz, Hiromi Koriyama-McKenzie, Carlos Cervera, Justin Z Chenet al.",2023 Jun,Lancet Infect Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36716763/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased antimicrobial use despite low rates of bacterial co-infection. Prospective audit and feedback is recommended to optimise antibiotic prescribing, but high-quality evidence supporting its use for COVID-19 is absent. We aimed to study the efficacy and safety of prospective audit and feedback in patients admitted to hospital for the treatment of COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      COVASP was a prospective, pragmatic, non-inferiority, small-unit, cluster-randomised trial comparing prospective audit and feedback plus standard of care with standard of care alone in adults admitted to three hospitals in Edmonton, AB, Canada, with COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients aged at least 18 years who were admitted from the community to a designated study bed with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the preceding 14 days were included if they had an oxygen saturation of 94% or lower on room air, required supplemental oxygen, or had chest-imaging findings compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were excluded if they were transferred in from another acute care centre, enrolled in another clinical trial that involved antibiotic therapy, expected to progress to palliative care or death within 48 h of hospital admission, or managed by any member of the research team within 30 days of enrolment. COVID-19 unit and critical care unit beds were stratified and randomly assigned (1:1) to the prospective audit and feedback plus standard of care group or the standard of care group. Patients were masked to their bed assignment but the attending physician and study team were not. The primary outcome was clinical status on postadmission day 15, measured using a seven-point ordinal scale. We used a non-inferiority margin of 0·5. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04896866, and is now closed.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between March 1 and Oct 29, 2021, 1411 patients were screened and 886 were enrolled: 457 into the prospective audit and feedback plus standard of care group, of whom 429 completed the study, and 429 into the standard of care group, of whom 404 completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups, with an overall mean age of 56·7 years (SD 17·3) and a median baseline ordinal scale of 4·0 (IQR 4·0-5·0). 301 audit and feedback events were recorded in the intervention group and 215 recommendations were made, of which 181 (84%) were accepted. Despite lower antibiotic use in the intervention group than in the control group (length of therapy 364·9 vs 384·2 days per 1000 patient days), clinical status at postadmission day 15 was non-inferior (median ordinal score 2·0 [IQR 2·0-3·0] vs 2·0 [IQR 2·0-4·0]; p=0·37, Mann-Whitney U test). Neutropenia was uncommon in both the intervention group (13 [3%] of 420 patients) and the control group (20 [5%] of 396 patients), and acute kidney injury occurred at a similar rate in both groups (74 [18%] of 421 patients in the intervention group and 76 [19%] of 399 patients in the control group). No intervention-related deaths were recorded.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      This cluster-randomised clinical trial shows that prospective audit and feedback is safe and effective in optimising and reducing antibiotic use in adults admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Despite many competing priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic, antimicrobial stewardship should remain a priority to mitigate the overuse of antibiotics in this population.

Kidney Damage Biomarkers and Incident Chronic Kidney Disease During Blood Pressure Reduction: A Case-Control Study.,"William R Zhang, Timothy E Craven, Rakesh Malhotra, Alfred K Cheung, Michel Chonchol, Paul Drawz, Mark J Sarnak, Chirag R Parikh, Michael G Shlipak, Joachim H Ix                              ;, SPRINT Research Group, William R Zhanget al.",2018 Nov 6,Ann Intern Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30357395/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Whether the increased incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) during intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering is accompanied by intrinsic kidney injury is unknown.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare changes in kidney damage biomarkers between incident CKD case participants and matched control participants as well as between case participants in the intensive (<120 mm Hg) versus the standard (<140 mm Hg) SBP management groups of SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial).
    


          Design:
        
      
      Nested case-control study within SPRINT.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Adults with hypertension without baseline kidney disease.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Case participants (n = 162), who developed incident CKD during trial follow-up (128 in the intensive and 34 in the standard group), and control participants (n = 162) without incident CKD, who were matched on age, sex, race, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, and randomization group.
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      9 urinary biomarkers of kidney damage were measured at baseline and at 1 year. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate 1-year biomarker changes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Higher concentrations of urinary albumin, kidney injury molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 at baseline were significantly associated with greater odds of incident CKD (adjusted odds ratio per doubling: 1.50 [95% CI, 1.14 to 1.98], 1.51 [CI, 1.05 to 2.17], and 1.70 [CI, 1.13 to 2.56], respectively). After 1 year of blood pressure intervention, incident CKD case participants in the intensive group had significantly greater decreases in albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), interleukin-18, anti-chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and uromodulin than the matched control participants. Compared with case participants in the standard group, those in the intensive group had significantly greater decreases in ACR, β2-microglobulin, α1-microglobulin, YKL-40, and uromodulin.
    


          Limitation:
        
      
      Biomarker measurements were available only at baseline and 1 year.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Incident CKD in the setting of intensive SBP lowering was accompanied by decreases, rather than elevations, in levels of kidney damage biomarkers and thus may reflect benign changes in renal blood flow rather than intrinsic injury.

"Sotorasib for previously treated colorectal cancers with KRASG12C mutation (CodeBreaK100): a prespecified analysis of a single-arm, phase 2 trial.","Marwan G Fakih, Scott Kopetz, Yasutoshi Kuboki, Tae Won Kim, Pamela N Munster, John C Krauss, Gerald S Falchook, Sae-Won Han, Volker Heinemann, Kei Muro, John H Strickler, David S Hong, Crystal S Denlinger, Gustavo Girotto, Myung-Ah Lee, Haby Henary, Qui Tran, Joseph K Park, Gataree Ngarmchamnanrith, Hans Prenen, Timothy J Price, Marwan G Fakihet al.",2022 Jan,Lancet Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34919824/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Sotorasib, a specific, irreversible KRASG12C protein inhibitor, has shown monotherapy clinical activity in KRASG12C-mutated solid tumours, including colorectal cancer, in the CodeBreaK100 phase 1 trial. We aimed to investigate the activity and safety of sotorasib in phase 2 of the trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this single-arm, phase 2 trial, adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced solid tumours were enrolled, from 59 medical centres in 11 countries, if they were aged 18 years or older, had at least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or lower. Only data for patients with colorectal cancer, enrolled at 33 medical centres in nine countries, are presented from this basket trial. To be enrolled, the patients had to have progressed after receiving fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan treatment. These patients were administered 960 mg sotorasib orally once per day until disease progression, development of unacceptable side-effects, withdrawal of consent, or death. The primary endpoint was objective response (complete or partial response) as assessed by blinded independent central review. Response was evaluated in patients who received at least one dose of sotorasib and had at least one measurable lesion at baseline; safety was evaluated in patients who received at least one dose of sotorasib. This analysis is a prespecified analysis triggered by the phase 2 colorectal cancer cohort. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03600883, and is active but no longer recruiting.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      On March 1, 2021, at data cutoff, 62 patients with KRASG12C-mutant colorectal cancer had been enrolled between Aug 14, 2019, and May 21, 2020, and had received at least one dose of sotorasib monotherapy. Objective response was observed in six (9·7%, 95% CI 3·6-19·9) of 62 patients, all with partial response. Treatment-related adverse events at grade 3 occurred in six (10%) patients, the most common of which was diarrhoea (two [3%] of 62 patients), and at grade 4 occurred in one (2%) patient (blood creatine phosphokinase increase); no fatal events were recorded. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in two (3%) patients (back pain and acute kidney injury).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Although the 9·7% overall response rate did not reach the benchmark, oral administration of sotorasib once per day showed modest anti-tumour activity and manageable safety in these heavily pretreated chemorefractory patients. Sotorasib is under evaluation in combination with other therapeutics to increase potential activity and overcome potential resistance mechanisms.

      AZD6244 is a MEK1/2 inhibitor with significant preclinical activity in multiple myeloma cells. This phase II study used a two-stage Simon design to determine the AZD6244 response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
    


          Experimental design:
        
      
      AZD6244 (75 mg) was administered orally, twice a day, continuously for 28-day cycles. Response was evaluated after three cycles.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-six patients received therapy. The median age was 65 years (range: 43-81) and the median number of prior therapies was 5 (range: 2-11). The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities included anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and fatigue. Three deaths occurred possibly related to AZD6244 (2 due to sepsis, 1 due to acute kidney injury). After AZD6244 discontinuation, three additional deaths occurred due to disease progression. The response rate (CR + PR) was 5.6% with a mean duration of response of 4.95 months and median progression-free survival time of 3.52 months. One patient had a very good partial response (VGPR), 1 patient had a partial response, 17 patients had stable disease, 13 patients had progressive disease, and 4 patients could not be assessed for response. Pharmacodynamic studies revealed variable effects on bone marrow CD138(+) cell MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The best clinical response, a prolonged VGPR, occurred in a patient with an MMSET translocation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Single-agent AZD6244 was tolerable and had minimal activity in this heavily pretreated population."
Comparison of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Management Strategies Before Cardiac Surgery: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Registry Trial.,"Sean van Diepen, Colleen M Norris, Yinggan Zheng, Jayan Nagendran, Michelle M Graham, Damaris Gaete Ortega, Derek R Townsend, Justin A Ezekowitz, Sean M Bagshaw, Sean van Diepenet al.",2018 Oct 16,J Am Heart Assoc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30371293/,No keywords found,"Background Postoperative clinical outcomes associated with the preoperative continuation or discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) or angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) before cardiac surgery remain unclear. Methods and Results In a single-center, open-label, randomized, registry-based clinical trial, patients undergoing nonemergent cardiac surgery were assigned to ACEI / ARB continuation or discontinuation 2 days before surgery. Among the 584 patients screened, 261 met study criteria and 126 (48.3%) patients were enrolled. In total,121 patients (96% adherence; 60 to continuation and 61 to ACEI / ARB discontinuation) underwent surgery and completed the study protocol, and follow-up was 100% complete. Postoperative intravenous vasopressor use (78.3% versus 75.4%, P=0.703), vasodilator use (71.7% versus 80.3%, P=0.265), vasoplegic shock (31.7% versus 27.9%, P=0.648), median duration of vasopressor (10 versus 5 hours, P=0.494), and vasodilator requirements (10 versus 9 hours, P=0.469) were not significantly different between the continuation and discontinuation arms. No differences were observed in the incidence of acute kidney injury (1.7% versus 1.6%, P=0.991), stroke (no events, mortality (1.7% versus 1.6%, P=0.991), median duration of mechanical ventilation (6 versus 6 hours, P=0.680), and median intensive care unit length of stay (43 versus 27 hours, P=0.420) between the treatment arms. Conclusions A randomized study evaluating the routine continuation or discontinuation of ACEIs or ARB s before cardiac surgery was feasible, and treatment assignment was not associated with differences in postoperative physiological or clinical outcomes. These preliminary findings suggest that preoperative ACEI / ARB management strategies did not affect the postoperative course of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

Acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery: is minocycline protective?,"Ladan Golestaneh, Kathryn Lindsey, Pooja Malhotra, Faraj Kargoli, Emily Farkas, Hendrick Barner, Rizwan Qazi, Anna Schmidt, Michael Rauchman, Ziyad Al-Aly, Robert Johnson, Kevin Martin, Pierre Dagher, Allon Friedman, Tarek M El-Achkar, Ladan Golestanehet al.",2015 Apr,J Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25348221/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac bypass surgery (CABG) is common and carries a significant association with morbidity and mortality. Since minocycline therapy attenuates kidney injury in animal models of AKI, we tested its effects in patients undergoing CABG.
    


          Design, setting, participants and measurements:
        
      
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center study. We screened high risk patients who were scheduled to undergo CABG in two medical centers between Jan 2008 and June 2011. 40 patients were randomized and 19 patients in each group completed the study. Minocycline prophylaxis was given twice daily, at least for four doses prior to CABG. Primary outcome was defined as AKI [0.3 mg/dl increase in creatinine (Cr)] within 5 days after surgery. Daily serum Cr for 5 days, various clinical and hemodynamic measures and length of stay were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The two groups had similar baseline and intra-operative characteristics. The primary outcome occurred in 52.6% of patients in the minocycline group as compared to 36.8% of patients in the placebo group (p = 0.51). Peak Cr was 1.6 ± 0.7 vs. 1.5 ± 0.7 mg/dl (p = 0.45) in minocycline and placebo groups, respectively. Death at 30 days occurred in 0 vs. 10.5% in the minocycline and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.48). There were no differences in post-operative length of stay, and cardiovascular events between the two groups. There was a trend towards lower diastolic pulmonary artery pressure [16.8 ± 4.7 vs. 20.7 ± 6.6 mmHg (p = 0.059)] and central venous pressure [11.8 ± 4.3 vs. 14.6 ± 5.6 mmHg (p = 0.13)] in the minocycline group compared to placebo on the first day after surgery.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Minocycline did not protect against AKI post-CABG."

      Few antiviral therapies have been studied in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and kidney impairment. Herein, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of remdesivir, its metabolites, and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin excipient were evaluated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and severe kidney impairment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In REDPINE, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, participants aged ≥12 years hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia with acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or kidney failure were randomized 2:1 to receive intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1; 100 mg daily up to day 5) or placebo (enrollment from March 2021 to March 2022). The primary efficacy end point was the composite of the all-cause mortality rate or invasive mechanical ventilation rate through day 29. Safety was evaluated through day 60.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Although enrollment concluded early, 243 participants were enrolled and treated (remdesivir, n = 163; placebo, n = 80). At baseline, 90 participants (37.0%) had acute kidney injury (remdesivir, n = 60; placebo, n = 30), 64 (26.3%) had chronic kidney disease (remdesivir, n = 44; placebo, n = 20), and 89 (36.6%) had kidney failure (remdesivir, n = 59; placebo, n = 30); and 31 (12.8%) were vaccinated against COVID-19. Composite all-cause mortality or invasive mechanical ventilation rates through day 29 were 29.4% and 32.5% in the remdesivir and placebo group, respectively (P = .61). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 80.4% for remdesivir versus 77.5% for placebo, and serious adverse events in 50.3% versus 50.0%, respectively. Pharmacokinetic plasma exposure to remdesivir was not affected by kidney function.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although the study was underpowered, no significant difference in efficacy was observed between treatment groups. REDPINE demonstrated that remdesivir is safe in patients with COVID-19 and severe kidney impairment.

      To evaluate the effects of separate and combined use of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) exenatide on measures of kidney function.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prespecified secondary analysis of the DECREASE trial, we enrolled 66 obese patients with type 2 diabetes in a 16-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate the effects of dapagliflozin and exenatide twice daily, alone or in combination, versus placebo on 24-hour urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), creatinine and cystatin C-estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and kidney injury molecule-1:creatinine ratio (KIM-1:Cr).
    


          Results:
        
      
      At week 16, the mean UACR change from baseline was -39.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] -58.6, -11.9; P = 0.001) in the combined exenatide-dapagliflozin group, -18.1% (95% CI -43.1, 18.0; P = 0.278) in the dapagliflozin group, -15.6% (95% CI -41.4, 21.6; P = 0.357) in the exenatide group and - 11.0% (95% CI -39.8, 31.5; P = 0.552) in the placebo group. Compared to placebo, UACR difference at week 16 in the exenatide-dapagliflozin group was -32.2% (95% CI -60.7, 16.9; P = 0.159). Effects were similar in 37 participants who were using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers at baseline. Compared to placebo, in the exenatide-dapagliflozin group, an acute dip in estimated GFR was observed with creatinine-estimated GFR (-4.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 [95% CI -9.3, 1.2]; P = 0.129) and cystatin C-estimated GFR (-10.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 [95% CI -14.9, -5.8]; P < 0.001). The mean KIM-1:Cr difference in the combined treatment arm versus placebo was -43.8% (95% CI -73.5, 18.9; P = 0.129).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This prespecified secondary analysis suggests that combined therapy with exenatide and dapagliflozin may have synergistic effects on markers of kidney function compared to either therapy alone or placebo in obese patients with type 2 diabetes."

      We did a phase 2 trial of pembrolizumab in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or melanoma with untreated brain metastases to determine the activity of PD-1 blockade in the CNS. Interim results were previously published, and we now report an updated analysis of the full NSCLC cohort.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was an open-label, phase 2 study of patients from the Yale Cancer Center (CT, USA). Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age with stage IV NSCLC with at least one brain metastasis 5-20 mm in size, not previously treated or progressing after previous radiotherapy, no neurological symptoms or corticosteroid requirement, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status less than two. Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria was used to evaluate CNS disease; systemic disease was not required for participation. Patients were treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. Patients were in two cohorts: cohort 1 was for those with PD-L1 expression of at least 1% and cohort 2 was patients with PD-L1 less than 1% or unevaluable. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a brain metastasis response (partial response or complete response, according to mRECIST). All treated patients were analysed for response and safety endpoints. This study is closed to accrual and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02085070.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between March 31, 2014, and May 21, 2018, 42 patients were treated. Median follow-up was 8·3 months (IQR 4·5-26·2). 11 (29·7% [95% CI 15·9-47·0]) of 37 patients in cohort 1 had a brain metastasis response. There were no responses in cohort 2. Grade 3-4 adverse events related to treatment included two patients with pneumonitis, and one each with constitutional symptoms, colitis, adrenal insufficiency, hyperglycaemia, and hypokalaemia. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in six (14%) of 42 patients and were pneumonitis (n=2), acute kidney injury, colitis, hypokalaemia, and adrenal insufficiency (n=1 each). There were no treatment-related deaths.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Pembrolizumab has activity in brain metastases from NSCLC with PD-L1 expression at least 1% and is safe in selected patients with untreated brain metastases. Further investigation of immunotherapy in patients with CNS disease from NSCLC is warranted.

Clinical Utility of a Biomarker to Detect Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury during Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedures.,"John Peabody, David Paculdo, Czarlota Valdenor, Peter A McCullough, Eisei Noiri, Takeshi Sugaya, Jeffrey R Dahlen, John Peabodyet al.",2022,Cardiorenal Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35034025/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a major clinical complication of percutaneous cardiovascular procedures requiring iodinated contrast. Despite its relative frequency, practicing physicians are unlikely to identify or treat this condition.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a 2-round clinical trial of simulated patients, we examined the clinical utility of a urine-based assay that measures liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), a novel marker of CI-AKI. We sought to determine if interventional cardiologists' ability to diagnose and treat potential CI-AKI improved using the biomarker assay for 3 different patient types: pre-procedure, peri-procedure, and post-procedure patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      154 participating cardiologists were randomly divided into either control or intervention. At baseline, we found no difference in the demographics or how they identified and treated potential complications of AKI, with both groups providing less than half the necessary care to their patients (46.4% for control vs. 47.6% for intervention, p = 0.250). The introduction of L-FABP into patient care resulted in a statistically significant improvement of 4.6% (p = 0.001). Compared to controls, physicians receiving L-FABP results were 2.9 times more likely to correctly identify their patients' risk for AKI (95% CI 2.1-4.0) and were more than twice as likely to treat for AKI by providing volume expansion and withholding nephrotoxic medications. We found the greatest clinical utility in the pre-procedure and peri-procedure settings but limited value in the post-procedure setting.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study suggests L-FABP as a clinical marker for assessing the risk of potential CI-AKI, has clinical utility, and can lead to more accurate diagnosis and treatment."

      Although rectal indometacin 100 mg is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in high-risk patients, the optimal dose is unknown, and pancreatitis incidence remains high. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two dose regimens of rectal indometacin on the frequency and severity of pancreatitis after ERCP in high-risk patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomised, double-blind, comparative effectiveness trial, we enrolled patients from six tertiary medical centres in the USA. Eligible patients were those at high risk for the development of pancreatitis after ERCP. We randomly assigned eligible patients (1:1) immediately after ERCP to receive either two 50 mg indometacin suppositories and a placebo suppository (standard-dose group) or three 50 mg indometacin suppositories (high-dose group). 4 h after the procedure, patients assigned to the high-dose group received an additional 50 mg indometacin suppository, whereas patients in the standard-dose group received an additional placebo suppository. The randomisation schedule, stratified according to study centre and with no other restrictions, was computer generated by an investigator who was uninvolved in the clinical care of any participants, distributed to the sites, and kept by personnel not directly involved with the study. These same personnel were responsible for packaging the drug and placebo in opaque envelopes. Patients, study personnel, and treating physicians were masked to study group assignment. The primary outcome of the study was the development of pancreatitis after ERCP. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01912716, and enrolment is complete.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between July 9, 2013, and March 22, 2018, 1037 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either standard-dose (n=515) or high-dose indometacin (n=522). Pancreatitis after ERCP occurred in 141 (14%) of 1037 patients-76 (15%) of 515 patients in the standard-dose indometacin group and 65 (12%) of 522 patients in the high-dose indometacin group (risk ratio [RR] 1·19, 95% CI 0·87-1·61; p=0·32). We observed 19 adverse events that were potentially attributable to study drug. Clinically significant bleeding occurred in 14 (1%) of 1037 patients-six (1%) of 515 patients in the standard-dose indometacin group and eight (2%) of 522 patients in the high-dose indometacin group (p=0·79). Three (1%) of 522 patients in the high-dose indometacin group developed acute kidney injury versus none in the standard-dose group (p=0·25). A non-ST elevation myocardial infarction occurred in the standard-dose indometacin group 2 days after ERCP. A transient ischaemic attack occurred in the high-dose indometacin group 5 days after ERCP. All 19 adverse events, in addition to the 141 patients who developed pancreatitis after ERCP, were considered serious as all required admission to hospital. We observed no allergic reactions or deaths at 30 day follow-up.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Dose escalation to rectal indometacin 200 mg did not confer any advantage compared with the standard 100 mg regimen, with pancreatitis incidence remaining high in high-risk patients. Current practice should continue unchanged. Further research should consider the pharmacokinetics of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to determine the optimal timing of their administration to prevent pancreatitis after ERCP.

Targeting the interleukin-11 receptor α in metastatic prostate cancer: A first-in-man study.,"Renata Pasqualini, Randall E Millikan, Dawn R Christianson, Marina Cardó-Vila, Wouter H P Driessen, Ricardo J Giordano, Amin Hajitou, Anh G Hoang, Sijin Wen, Kirstin F Barnhart, Wallace B Baze, Valerie D Marcott, David H Hawke, Kim-Anh Do, Nora M Navone, Eleni Efstathiou, Patricia Troncoso, Roy R Lobb, Christopher J Logothetis, Wadih Arap, Renata Pasqualiniet al.",2015 Jul 15,Cancer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25832466/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Receptors in tumor blood vessels are attractive targets for ligand-directed drug discovery and development. The authors have worked systematically to map human endothelial receptors (""vascular zip codes"") within tumors through direct peptide library selection in cancer patients. Previously, they selected a ligand-binding motif to the interleukin-11 receptor alpha (IL-11Rα) in the human vasculature.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The authors generated a ligand-directed, peptidomimetic drug (bone metastasis-targeting peptidomimetic-11 [BMTP-11]) for IL-11Rα-based human tumor vascular targeting. Preclinical studies (efficacy/toxicity) included evaluating BMTP-11 in prostate cancer xenograft models, drug localization, targeted apoptotic effects, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses, and dose-range determination, including formal (good laboratory practice) toxicity across rodent and nonhuman primate species. The initial BMTP-11 clinical development also is reported based on a single-institution, open-label, first-in-class, first-in-man trial (National Clinical Trials number NCT00872157) in patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer.
    


          Results:
        
      
      BMTP-11 was preclinically promising and, thus, was chosen for clinical development in patients. Limited numbers of patients who had castrate-resistant prostate cancer with osteoblastic bone metastases were enrolled into a phase 0 trial with biology-driven endpoints. The authors demonstrated biopsy-verified localization of BMTP-11 to tumors in the bone marrow and drug-induced apoptosis in all patients. Moreover, the maximum tolerated dose was identified on a weekly schedule (20-30 mg/m(2) ). Finally, a renal dose-limiting toxicity was determined, namely, dose-dependent, reversible nephrotoxicity with proteinuria and casts involving increased serum creatinine.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These biologic endpoints establish BMTP-11 as a targeted drug candidate in metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Within a larger discovery context, the current findings indicate that functional tumor vascular ligand-receptor targeting systems may be identified through direct combinatorial selection of peptide libraries in cancer patients."
"Effects of terlipressin infusion during hepatobiliary surgery on systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics, renal function and blood loss: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial.","Magdy Mohammed Mahdy, Mostafa Samy Abbas, Emad Zarief Kamel, Mohamed Fathy Mostafa, Ragaa Herdan, Shimaa Abbas Hassan, Ramy Hassan, Ahmed M Taha, Tameem M Ibraheem, Bashir A Fadel, Mohammed Geddawy, Jehan Ahmed Sayed, Osama Ali Ibraheim, Magdy Mohammed Mahdyet al.",2019 Jun 15,BMC Anesthesiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31200638/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Terlipressin, in general, is a vasopressor which acts via V1 receptors. Its infusion elevates mean blood pressure and can reduce bleeding which has a splanchnic origin. The primary outcome was to assess the impact of intraoperative terlipressin infusion on portal venous pressure during hepatobiliary surgery; the 2ry outcomes included effects upon systemic hemodynamics, estimated blood loss, and postoperative renal functions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective randomized study involved 50 patients undergoing hepatobiliary surgery who were randomly and equally allocated into terlipressin group, or a control group. The terlipressin group received an initial bolus dose of (1 mg over 30 min) followed by a continuous infusion of 2 μg/kg/h throughout the procedure and gradually weaned over the first four postoperative hours, whereas the control group received the same volumes of normal saline. The portal venous pressure changes were measured directly through a portal vein angiocatheter.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Portal pressure was significantly reduced over time in the terlipressin group only (from 17.88 ± 7.32 to 15.96 ± 6.55 mmHg, p < .001). Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly higher in the terlipressin group. Estimated blood loss was significantly higher in the control group than the terlipressin group (1065.7 ± 202 versus 842 ± 145.5 ml; p = 0.004), and the units of packed RBCs transfused were significantly higher in the control group ((0-2) versus (0-4) p = 0.003). There was no significant difference between groups as regards the incidence of acute kidney injury.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Intraoperative infusion of terlipressin during hepatobiliary surgery was shown to improve intraoperative portal hemodynamics with subsequent reduction in blood loss.

Fluid Overload and Kidney Injury Score: A Multidimensional Real-Time Assessment of Renal Disease Burden in the Critically Ill Patient.,"Ayse Akcan-Arikan, Daniel J Gebhard, Megan A Arnold, Laura L Loftis, Curtis E Kennedy, Ayse Akcan-Arikanet al.",2017 Jun,Pediatr Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28406863/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      Interruptive acute kidney injury alerts are reported to decrease acute kidney injury-related mortality in adults. Critically ill children have multiple acute kidney injury risk factors; although recognition has improved due to standardized definitions, subtle changes in serum creatinine make acute kidney injury recognition challenging. Age and body habitus variability prevent a uniform maximum threshold of creatinine. Exposure of nephrotoxic medications is common but not accounted for in kidney injury scores. Current severity of illness measures do not include fluid overload, a well-described mortality risk factor. We hypothesized that a multidimensional measure of renal status would better characterize renal severity of illness while maintaining or improving on correlation measures with adverse outcomes, when compared with traditional acute kidney injury staging.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A novel, real-time, multidimensional, renal status measure, combining acute kidney injury, fluid overload greater than or equal to 15%, and nephrotoxin exposure, was developed (Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score) and prospectively applied to all patient encounters. Peak Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score values prior to discharge or death were used to measure correlation with outcomes.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Quarternary PICU of a freestanding children's hospital.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      All patients admitted over 18 months.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      None.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Peak Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score ranged between 0 and 14 in 2,830 PICU patients (median age, 5.5 yr; interquartile range, 1.3-12.9; 55% male), 66% of patients had Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score greater than or equal to 1. Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score was independently associated with PICU mortality and PICU and hospital length of stay when controlled for age, Pediatric Risk of Mortality-3, ventilator, pressor, and renal replacement therapy use (p = 0.047). Mortality increased from 1.5% in Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score 0 to 40% in Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score 8+. When urine output points were excluded, Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score was more strongly correlated with mortality than fluid overload or acute kidney injury definitions alone.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A multidimensional score of renal disease burden was significantly associated with adverse PICU outcomes. Further studies will evaluate Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score as a warning and decision support tool to impact patient-centered outcomes."
"Efficacy of sitagliptin for the hospital management of general medicine and surgery patients with type 2 diabetes (Sita-Hospital): a multicentre, prospective, open-label, non-inferiority randomised trial.","Francisco J Pasquel, Roma Gianchandani, Daniel J Rubin, Kathleen M Dungan, Isabel Anzola, Patricia C Gomez, Limin Peng, Israel Hodish, Tim Bodnar, David Wesorick, Vijay Balakrishnan, Kwame Osei, Guillermo E Umpierrez, Francisco J Pasquelet al.",2017 Feb,Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27964837/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The role of incretin-based drugs in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to hospital has not been extensively assessed. In this study, we compared the safety and efficacy of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) plus basal insulin with a basal-bolus insulin regimen for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes in general medicine and surgery in hospitals.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We did a multicentre, prospective, open-label, non-inferiority randomised clinical trial (Sita-Hospital) in five hospitals in the USA, enrolling patients aged 18-80 years with type 2 diabetes and a random blood glucose concentration of 7·8-22·2 mmol/L who were being treated with diet or oral antidiabetic drugs or had a total daily insulin dose of 0·6 units per kg or less, admitted to general medicine and surgery services. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to receive either sitagliptin plus basal glargine once daily (the sitagliptin-basal group) or a basal-bolus regimen with glargine once daily and rapid-acting insulin lispro or aspart before meals (the basal-bolus group) during the hospital stay. All other antidiabetic drugs were discontinued on admission. The randomisation was achieved by computer-generated tables with block stratification according to randomisation blood glucose concentrations (ie, higher or lower than 11·1 mmol/L). The primary endpoint of the trial was non-inferiority in mean differences between groups in their daily blood glucose concentrations during the first 10 days of therapy (point-of-care measurements; non-inferiority was deemed a difference <1 mmol/L). The safety endpoints included hypoglycaemia and uncontrolled hyperglycaemia leading to treatment failure. All participants who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01845831.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Aug 23, 2013, and July 27, 2015, we recruited 279 patients, and randomly assigned 277 to treatment; 138 to sitagliptin-basal and 139 to basal-bolus. The length of stay in hospital was similar for both groups (median 4 days [IQR 3-8] vs 4 [3-8] days, p=0·54). The mean daily blood glucose concentration in the sitagliptin-basal group (9·5 mmol/L [SD 2·7]) was not inferior to that in the basal-bolus group 9·4 mmol/L [2·7]) with a mean blood glucose difference of 0·1 mmol/L (95% CI -0·6 to 0·7). No deaths occurred in this trial. Treatment failure occurred in 22 patients (16%) in the sitagliptin-basal group versus 26 (19%) in the basal-bolus group (p=0·54). Hypoglycaemia occurred in 13 patients (9%) in the sitagliptin-basal group and in 17 (12%) in the basal-bolus group (p=0·45). No differences in hospital complications were noted between groups. Seven patients (5%) developed acute kidney injury in the sitagliptin-basal group and six (4%) in the basal-bolus group. One patient (0·7%) developed acute pancreatitis (in the basal-bolus group).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      The trial met the non-inferiority threshold for the primary endpoint, because there was no significant difference between groups in mean daily blood glucose concentrations. Treatment with sitagliptin plus basal insulin is as effective and safe as, and a convenient alternative to, the labour-intensive basal-bolus insulin regimen for the management of hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to general medicine and surgery services in hospital in the non-intensive-care setting.

Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of meropenem in critically ill patients with acute kidney disease.,"Rezvan Hassanpour, Shadi Ziaie, Farzad Kobarfard, Mehran Kouchek, Mirmohammad Miri, Azadeh Ahmadi Koomleh, Seyedpouzhia Shojaei, Sara Salarian, Elham Pourheidar, Fatemeh Nezarat, Mohammad Sistanizad, Rezvan Hassanpouret al.",2021 Jun,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33409684/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      No study has been evaluated pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of β-lactam antibiotics in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), not requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). We evaluated the time that plasma concentrations remain above four times the MIC (ft > 4MIC) and PK parameters of meropenem in this population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective, randomized clinical trial (RCT), all patients received standard dose (3 g daily) of meropenem for 48 h, then randomly allocated in standard or adjusted groups. The standard group received meropenem without dose adjustment. In the adjusted group, the meropenem dose was adjusted based on the Cockcroft-Gault(C-G) equation. Meropenem concentrations were measured at the peak and trough times on the 2nd and 5th days of the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      On the 2nd day of the study, 3 out of 10 (30%) of patients attained the PD target (≥ 80%ft > 4MIC). In the 5th day of the study, the PD target was attained in 2 out of 10 (20%) and 1 out of 5 (20%) of patients who received standard and adjusted doses of meropenem, respectively (p = 1). In all samples, increased volume of distribution (Vd) (median; IQR) (46.04; 23.06-103.18 L), terminal half-life (T1/2) (4.51; 2.67-8.88 h) and decreased clearance (6.52; 4.43-10.16 L/h) have been shown.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In critically ill patients with AKI, who not receive RRT, standard doses, and adjusted according to renal function of meropenem failed to achieve PD target of ≥ 80%ft > 4MIC. Higher doses are required for this target.

      Most patients with myelofibrosis develop ruxolitinib intolerance or disease that is relapsed or refractory, and survival rates after ruxolitinib discontinuation are poor. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fedratinib versus best available therapy (BAT) in patients with myelofibrosis previously treated with ruxolitinib.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      FREEDOM2 was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial in 86 clinics in 16 countries, in which patients aged at least 18 years with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis that was relapsed or refractory or intolerant to ruxolitinib with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2 were stratified by spleen size by palpation, platelet count, and previous ruxolitinib treatment, and randomly assigned 2:1 by interactive response technology to receive fedratinib 400 mg per day (4 × 100 mg capsules orally once daily, open-label) or BAT. Patients received prophylactic antiemetics and thiamine supplementation, and symptomatic antidiarrhoeals as required. Primary endpoint was proportion of patients reaching spleen volume reduction (SVR) of at least 35% (SVR35) at end of cycle 6 in the intention-to-treat population. This manuscript reports the primary analysis of the trial; follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03952039.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Sept 9, 2019 and June 24, 2022, of 316 patients screened, 201 were randomly assigned and treated (134 to fedratinib, 67 to BAT [including 52 receiving ruxolitinib]); 46 patients from the BAT group crossed over to fedratinib. Approximately half of enrolled patients were male (fedratinib 75 [56%] of 134; BAT 30 [45%] of 67) and most were White (fedratinib 106 [79%] of 134; BAT 58 [87%] of 67). At data cutoff (Dec 27, 2022), median survival follow-up was 64·5 weeks (IQR 37·9-104·9). SVR35 at end of cycle 6 was seen in 48 (36%) of 134 patients receiving fedratinib versus four (6%) of 67 patients receiving BAT (30% difference; 95% CI 20-39; one-sided p-value <0·0001). During the first six cycles 53 (40%) of 134 patients in the fedratinib group and 8 (12%) of 67 patients in the BAT group had grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events, most frequently anaemia (fedratinib 12 [9%] of 134; BAT 6 [9%] of 67) and thrombocytopenia (fedratinib 16 [12%] of 134; BAT 2 [3%] of 67); one patient in the fedratinib group died from acute kidney injury suspected to be related to study drug (no treatment-related deaths in the BAT group). Gastrointestinal adverse events occurred more frequently in the fedratinib group compared with the BAT group, but were mostly grade 1-2 in severity and more frequent in early cycles, and were less frequent than in prior clinical trials. A total of 28 (21%) of 134 patients in the fedratinib group and 3 (4%) of 67 patients in the BAT group had thiamine levels below lower limit of normal per central laboratory assessment, with only one case of low thiamine in the fedratinib arm after the introduction of prophylactic thiamine supplementation.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Findings from FREEDOM2 support fedratinib as a second-line Janus kinase inhibitor option to reduce spleen size after ruxolitinib failure or intolerance in patients with myelofibrosis, and shows effective strategies for management of gastrointestinal adverse events and low thiamine concentrations through prophylaxis, monitoring, and treatment.

Therefore, CNI-minimization strategies which decrease the CNI nephrotoxicity under the protection of additional immunosuppressant drugs have been developed. The aim of current cohort study was to compare the effect of two immunosuppressive protocols [tacrolimus (TAC) in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisolone (PRED) versus TAC in combination with sirolimus (SRL) and prednisolone] on the frequency of T helper cell subsets (Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells) and their associated cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17A) levels in renal allograft recipients. In this study, renal transplant recipients who received induction therapy (Antithymocyte globulin) and were also on triple immunosuppressive therapy were included and divided in to two groups: Group A was comprised 14 patients who received TAC, MMF and PERD whereas group B was composed of 10 patients who received TAC, SRL and PERD. The frequency of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the patients was analyzed by flow cytometry before and 4 months after transplantation. In addition, IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17A concentrations in PBMC culture supernatants of patients before and 4 months after transplantation were quantified by ELISA. The results of our study showed that TAC, MMF and PRED protocol did not diminish the frequency of Th17 cells at 4 months post-transplantation (5% ± 2.5) compared with pre-transplantation (2.3% ± 1; P < 0.05). However, Th17 (3.6% ± 1.5 pre-transplantation vs 2.2% ± 0.9 at 4 months post-transplantation; P < 0.05), Th2 (1.4% ± 0.3 pre-transplantation vs 0.8% ± 0.4 at 4 months post-transplantation; P < 0.05) cell subsets and IL-4 concentration (71.5 pg/ml ± 12 pre-transplantation vs 62.5 pg/ml ±4.4 at 4 months post-transplantation; P < 0.05) were significantly decreased after transplantation in patients who had received SRL, TAC and PRED. In conclusion, the data of the current study suggest that using reduced dose of TAC in SRL, TAC and PRED protocol is in favor of allograft survival; however a cohort study with larger sample size is needed for confirming our results."

      In critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients, daily interruption of sedation has been shown to reduce the time on ventilation and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Data on whether a plan of no sedation, as compared with a plan of light sedation, has an effect on mortality are lacking.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, mechanically ventilated ICU patients to a plan of no sedation (nonsedation group) or to a plan of light sedation (i.e., to a level at which the patient was arousable, defined as a score of -2 to -3 on the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale [RASS], on which scores range from -5 [unresponsive] to +4 [combative]) (sedation group) with daily interruption. The primary outcome was mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were the number of major thromboembolic events, the number of days free from coma or delirium, acute kidney injury according to severity, the number of ICU-free days, and the number of ventilator-free days. Between-group differences were calculated as the value in the nonsedation group minus the value in the sedation group.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 710 patients underwent randomization, and 700 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two trial groups, except for the score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, which was 1 point higher in the nonsedation group than in the sedation group, indicating a greater chance of in-hospital death. The mean RASS score in the nonsedation group increased from -1.3 on day 1 to -0.8 on day 7 and, in the sedation group, from -2.3 on day 1 to -1.8 on day 7. Mortality at 90 days was 42.4% in the nonsedation group and 37.0% in the sedated group (difference, 5.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.2 to 12.2; P = 0.65). The number of ICU-free days and of ventilator-free days did not differ significantly between the trial groups. The patients in the nonsedation group had a median of 27 days free from coma or delirium, and those in the sedation group had a median of 26 days free from coma or delirium. A major thromboembolic event occurred in 1 patient (0.3%) in the nonsedation group and in 10 patients (2.8%) in the sedation group (difference, -2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.8 to -0.7 [unadjusted for multiple comparisons]).
    


          Conclusions:

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) down-regulates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, potentially increasing angiotensin II. We hypothesized that losartan compared to usual care decreases mortality and is safe in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to evaluate the effect of losartan versus usual care on 28-day mortality in patients hospitalized for acute COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eligibility criteria included adults admitted for acute COVID-19. Exclusion criteria were hypotension, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, and use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors within 7 days. Participants were randomized to losartan 25-100 mg/day orally for the hospital duration or 3 months or the control arm (usual care) in 29 hospitals in Canada and France. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital mortality, organ support, and serious adverse events (SAEs).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial was stopped early because of a serious safety concern with losartan. In 341 patients, any SAE and hypotension were significantly higher in the losartan versus usual care groups (any SAE: 39.8% vs 27.2%, respectively, P = .01; hypotension: 30.4% vs 15.3%, respectively, P < .001) in both ward and intensive care patients. The 28-day mortality did not differ between losartan (6.5%) versus usual care (5.9%) (odds ratio, 1.11 [95% confidence interval, .47-2.64]; P = .81), nor did organ dysfunction or secondary outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Caution is needed in deciding which patients to start or continue using ARBs in patients hospitalized with pneumonia to mitigate risk of hypotension, acute kidney injury, and other side effects. ARBs should not be added to care of patients hospitalized for acute COVID-19.

      Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors approved for myelofibrosis provide spleen and symptom improvements but do not meaningfully improve anaemia. Momelotinib, a first-in-class inhibitor of activin A receptor type 1 as well as JAK1 and JAK2, has shown symptom, spleen, and anaemia benefits in myelofibrosis. We aimed to confirm the differentiated clinical benefits of momelotinib versus the active comparator danazol in JAK-inhibitor-exposed, symptomatic patients with anaemia and intermediate-risk or high-risk myelofibrosis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      MOMENTUM is an international, double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study that enrolled patients at 107 sites across 21 countries worldwide. Eligible patients were 18 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis or post-polycythaemia vera or post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive momelotinib (200 mg orally once per day) plus danazol placebo (ie, the momelotinib group) or danazol (300 mg orally twice per day) plus momelotinib placebo (ie, the danazol group), stratified by total symptom score (TSS; <22 vs ≥22), spleen size (<12 cm vs ≥12 cm), red blood cell or whole blood units transfused in the 8 weeks before randomisation (0 units vs 1-4 units vs ≥5 units), and study site. The primary endpoint was the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) TSS response rate at week 24 (defined as ≥50% reduction in mean MFSAF TSS over the 28 days immediately before the end of week 24 compared with baseline). MOMENTUM is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04173494, and is active but not recruiting.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      195 patients were randomly assigned to either the momelotinib group (130 [67%]) or danazol group (65 [33%]) and received study treatment in the 24-week randomised treatment period between April 24, 2020, and Dec 3, 2021. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the momelotinib group reported a 50% or more reduction in TSS than in the danazol group (32 [25%] of 130 vs six [9%] of 65; proportion difference 16% [95% CI 6-26], p=0·0095). The most frequent grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events with momelotinib and danazol were haematological abnormalities by laboratory values: anaemia (79 [61%] of 130 vs 49 [75%] of 65) and thrombocytopenia (36 [28%] vs 17 [26%]). The most frequent non-haematological grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events with momelotinib and danazol were acute kidney injury (four [3%] of 130 vs six [9%] of 65) and pneumonia (three [2%] vs six [9%]).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Treatment with momelotinib, compared with danazol, resulted in clinically significant improvements in myelofibrosis-associated symptoms, anaemia measures, and spleen response, with favourable safety. These findings support the future use of momelotinib as an effective treatment in patients with myelofibrosis, especially in those with anaemia.

"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with nedaplatin versus cisplatin in stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma: an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised phase 3 trial.","Lin-Quan Tang, Dong-Ping Chen, Ling Guo, Hao-Yuan Mo, Ying Huang, Shan-Shan Guo, Bin Qi, Qing-Nan Tang, Pan Wang, Xiao-Yun Li, Ji-Bin Li, Qing Liu, Yuan-Hong Gao, Fang-Yun Xie, Li-Ting Liu, Yang Li, Sai-Lan Liu, Hao-Jun Xie, Yu-Jing Liang, Xue-Song Sun, Jin-Jie Yan, Yi-Shan Wu, Dong-Hua Luo, Pei-Yu Huang, Yan-Qun Xiang, Rui Sun, Ming-Yuan Chen, Xing Lv, Lin Wang, Wei-Xiong Xia, Chong Zhao, Ka-Jia Cao, Chao-Nan Qian, Xiang Guo, Ming-Huang Hong, Zhi-Qiang Nie, Qiu-Yan Chen, Hai-Qiang Mai, Lin-Quan Tanget al.",2018 Apr,Lancet Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501366/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is currently considered to be the standard treatment regimen for patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but has well known side-effects such as gastrointestinal reactions, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity. Nedaplatin was developed to decrease the toxic effects induced by cisplatin, and in this trial we assessed whether a nedaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen was non-inferior to a cisplatin-based regimen in patients with locoregional, stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We did an open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial at two centres in China. Patients aged 18-65 years with non-keratinising stage II-IVB (T1-4N1-3 or T3-4N0) nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a Karnofsky score of at least 70, and adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenously either nedaplatin 100 mg/m2 or cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22, and 43 for three cycles concurrently with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Randomisation was done manually using a computer-generated random number code and patients were stratified by treatment centre and clinical stage. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 2 years; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in 2-year progression-free survival between the two groups did not exceed 10%. Analyses were by both intention to treat and per protocol, including all patients who received at least one complete cycle of chemotherapy. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01540136, and is currently in follow-up.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Jan 16, 2012, and July 16, 2014, we randomly assigned 402 patients to nedaplatin-based (n=201) or cisplatin-based (n=201) concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In the intention-to-treat population, 2-year progression-free survival was 89·9% (95% CI 85·8-94·0) in the cisplatin group and 88·0% (83·5-94·5) in the nedaplatin group, with a difference of 1·9% (95% CI -4·2 to 8·0; pnon-inferiority=0·0048). In the per-protocol analysis (cisplatin group, n=197; nedaplatin group, n=196), 2-year progression-free survival was 89·7% (95% CI 85·4-94·0) in the cisplatin group and 88·7% (84·2-94·5) in the nedaplatin group, with a difference of 1·0% (95% CI -5·2 to 7·0; pnon-inferiority=0·0020). A significantly higher frequency of grade 3 or 4 vomiting (35 [18%] of 198 in the cisplatin group vs 12 [6%] of 200 in the nedaplatin group, p<0·0001), nausea (18 [9%] vs four [2%], p=0·0021), and anorexia (53 [27%] vs 26 [13%], p=0·00070) was observed in the cisplatin group compared with the nedaplatin group. 11 (6%) patients in the nedaplatin group had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia compared with four (2%) in the cisplatin group (p=0·065). Patients in the cisplatin group had a higher frequency of any grade or grade 3 or 4 late auditory or hearing toxicities than did patients in the nedaplatin group (grade 3 or 4: three [2%] in the nedaplatin group vs 11 [6%] in the cisplatin group, p=0·030). No patients died from treatment-related causes.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Our findings show that nedaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy represents an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with locoregional, advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Further investigations are needed to explore the potential use of this treatment as induction or adjuvant chemotherapy or in combination with other agents.

      Currently, there is a lack of evidence to guide optimal care for acute kidney injury (AKI) survivors. Therefore, post-discharge care by a multidisciplinary care team (MDCT) may improve these outcomes. This study aimed to demonstrate the outcomes of implementing comprehensive care by a MDCT in severe AKI survivors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study was a randomized controlled trial conducted between August 2018 to January 2021. Patients who survived severe AKI stage 2-3 were enrolled and randomized to be followed up with either comprehensive or standard care for 12 months. The comprehensive post-AKI care involved an MDCT (nephrologists, nurses, nutritionists, and pharmacists). The primary outcome was the feasibility outcomes; comprising of the rates of loss to follow up, 3-d dietary record, drug reconciliation, and drug alert rates at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included major adverse kidney events, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the amount of albuminuria at 12 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ninety-eight AKI stage 3 survivors were enrolled and randomized into comprehensive care and standard care groups (49 patients in each group). Compared to the standard care group, the comprehensive care group had significantly better feasibility outcomes; 3-d dietary record, drug reconciliation, and drug alerts (p < 0.001). The mean eGFR at 12 months were comparable between the two groups (66.74 vs. 61.12 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.54). The urine albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR) was significantly lower in the comprehensive care group (36.83 vs. 177.70 mg/g, p = 0.036), while the blood pressure control was also better in the comprehensive care group (87.9% vs. 57.5%, p = 0.006). There were no differences in the other renal outcomes between the two groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Comprehensive care by an MDCT is feasible and could be implemented for severe AKI survivors. MDCT involvement also yields better reduction of the UACR and better blood pressure control. Trial registration Clinicaltrial.gov: NCT04012008 (First registered July 9, 2019)."
Paracentesis-Induced Circulatory Dysfunction With Modest-Volume Paracentesis Is Partly Ameliorated by Albumin Infusion in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure.,"Vinod Arora, Rajan Vijayaraghavan, Rakhi Maiwall, Amrish Sahney, Sherin Sarah Thomas, Rehmat Ali, Priyanka Jain, Guresh Kumar, Shiv Kumar Sarin, Vinod Aroraet al.",2020 Sep,Hepatology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31849085/,No keywords found,"Background and aims:
        
      
      Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) is a serious complication of large-volume (>5 L) paracentesis in cirrhosis and is reduced with albumin infusion. There is a lack of data on PICD in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Because ACLF patients have greater hemodynamic derangements than patients with decompensated cirrhosis, we investigated whether PICD could develop with modest-volume paracentesis (MVP) and the role of albumin infusion.
    


          Approach and results:
        
      
      A total of 80 ACLF patients undergoing <5 L paracentesis were randomized to receive albumin (8 g/dL of ascitic fluid; n = 40) or no albumin (n = 40) and serially followed to detect PICD. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups, including volume of ascitic tap (4.16 ± 0.23 versus 4.14 ± 0.27 L; P = 0.72) and plasma renin activity (PRA; 20.5 ± 7.03 versus 23.2 ± 8.24 ng/mL/hour; P = 0.12). PICD was more frequent in the no-albumin group than the albumin group (70% versus 30%; P = 0.001), with higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (50% versus 27.5%; P = 0.04), hyponatremia (67.5% versus 22.5%; P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (62.5% versus 30%; P = 0.001), and in-house mortality (62.5% versus 27.5%; P = 0.003). PRA of 25.15 ng/mL at day 3 had sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 68%, respectively, for development of PICD at day 6. Albumin infusion decreased the incidence of PICD at day 6 (odds ratio, 0.068; 95% confidence interval, 0.011-0.43; P = 0.005).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PICD is common and develops even with MVP in ACLF patients. Albumin infusion decreases the incidence of PICD and mortality in patients with ACLF. Clinical trial identifier: NCT02467348."
"Effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin on plasma biomarkers TNFR-1, TNFR-2 and KIM-1 in the CANVAS trial.","Taha Sen, Jingwei Li, Brendon L Neuen, Bruce Neal, Clare Arnott, Chirag R Parikh, Steven G Coca, Vlado Perkovic, Kenneth W Mahaffey, Yshai Yavin, Norman Rosenthal, Michael K Hansen, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Taha Senet al.",2021 Oct,Diabetologia,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34415356/,No keywords found,"Aims/hypothesis:
        
      
      Higher plasma concentrations of tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-1, TNFR-2 and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) have been found to be associated with higher risk of kidney failure in individuals with type 2 diabetes in previous studies. Whether drugs can reduce these biomarkers is not well established. We measured these biomarkers in samples of the CANVAS study and examined the effect of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin on these biomarkers and assessed whether the early change in these biomarkers predict cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes in the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Biomarkers were measured with immunoassays (proprietary multiplex assay performed by RenalytixAI, New York, NY, USA) at baseline and years 1, 3 and 6. Mixed-effects models for repeated measures assessed the effect of canagliflozin vs placebo on the biomarkers. Associations of baseline levels and the early change (baseline to year 1) for each biomarker with the kidney outcome were assessed using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 3523/4330 (81.4%) of the CANVAS participants had available samples at baseline. Each doubling in baseline TNFR-1, TNFR-2 and KIM-1 was associated with a higher risk of kidney outcomes, with corresponding HRs of 3.7 (95% CI 2.3, 6.1; p < 0.01), 2.7 (95% CI 2.0, 3.6; p < 0.01) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.2, 1.8; p < 0.01), respectively. Canagliflozin reduced the level of the plasma biomarkers with differences in TNFR-1, TNFR-2 and KIM-1 between canagliflozin and placebo during follow-up of 2.8% (95% CI 3.4%, 1.3%; p < 0.01), 1.9% (95% CI 3.5%, 0.2%; p = 0.03) and 26.7% (95% CI 30.7%, 22.7%; p < 0.01), respectively. Within the canagliflozin treatment group, each 10% reduction in TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 at year 1 was associated with a lower risk of the kidney outcome (HR 0.8 [95% CI 0.7, 1.0; p = 0.02] and 0.9 [95% CI 0.9, 1.0; p < 0.01] respectively), independent of other patient characteristics. The baseline and 1 year change in biomarkers did not associate with cardiovascular or heart failure outcomes.
    


          Conclusions/interpretation:
        
      
      Canagliflozin decreased KIM-1 and modestly reduced TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 compared with placebo in individuals with type 2 diabetes in CANVAS. Early decreases in TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 during canagliflozin treatment were independently associated with a lower risk of kidney disease progression, suggesting that TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 have the potential to be pharmacodynamic markers of response to canagliflozin."

      To investigate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab, a human monoclonal antibody that binds programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), and the role of PD-L1 expression on clinical response in patients with advanced urothelial bladder cancer (UBC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label study is being conducted in patients with inoperable or metastatic solid tumors. We report here the results from the UBC expansion cohort. Durvalumab (MEDI4736, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered intravenously for up to 12 months. The primary end point was safety, and objective response rate (ORR, confirmed) was a key secondary end point. An exploratory analysis of pretreatment tumor biopsies led to defining PD-L1-positive as ≥ 25% of tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating immune cells expressing membrane PD-L1.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 61 patients (40 PD-L1-positive, 21 PD-L1-negative), 93.4% of whom received one or more prior therapies for advanced disease, were treated (median duration of follow-up, 4.3 months). The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade were fatigue (13.1%), diarrhea (9.8%), and decreased appetite (8.2%). Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in three patients (4.9%); there were no treatment-related grade 4 or 5 AEs. One treatment-related AE (acute kidney injury) resulted in treatment discontinuation. The ORR was 31.0% (95% CI, 17.6 to 47.1) in 42 response-evaluable patients, 46.4% (95% CI, 27.5 to 66.1) in the PD-L1-positive subgroup, and 0% (95% CI, 0.0 to 23.2) in the PD-L1-negative subgroup.

      VEGF and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2)-mediated signalling and angiogenesis can contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of gastric cancer. We aimed to assess whether the addition of ramucirumab, a VEGFR-2 antagonist monoclonal antibody, to first-line chemotherapy improves outcomes in patients with metastatic gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      For this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 126 centres in 20 countries, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with metastatic, HER2-negative gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive web response system to receive cisplatin (80 mg/m2, on the first day) plus capecitabine (1000 mg/m2, twice daily for 14 days), every 21 days, and either ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) or placebo on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. 5-Fluorouracil (800 mg/m2 intravenous infusion on days 1-5) was permitted in patients unable to take capecitabine. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival, analysed by intention to treat in the first 508 patients. We did a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint, including a central review of CT scans. Overall survival was a key secondary endpoint. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02314117.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Jan 28, 2015, and Sept 16, 2016, 645 patients were randomly assigned to receive ramucirumab plus fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin (n=326) or placebo plus fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin (n=319). Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab group than the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·753, 95% CI 0·607-0·935, p=0·0106; median progression-free survival 5·7 months [5·5-6·5] vs 5·4 months [4·5-5·7]). A sensitivity analysis based on central independent review of the radiological images did not corroborate the investigator-assessed difference in progression-free survival (HR 0·961, 95% CI 0·768-1·203, p=0·74). There was no difference in overall survival between groups (0·962, 0·801-1·156, p=0·6757; median overall survival 11·2 months [9·9-11·9] in the ramucirumab group vs 10·7 months [9·5-11·9] in the placebo group). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (85 [26%] of 323 patients in the ramucirumab group vs 85 [27%] of 315 in the placebo group), anaemia (39 [12%] vs 44 [14%]), and hypertension (32 [10%] vs 5 [2%]). The incidence of any-grade serious adverse events was 160 (50%) of 323 patients in the ramucirumab group and 149 (47%) of 315 patients in the placebo group. The most common serious adverse events were vomiting (14 [4%] in the ramucirumab group vs 21 [7%] in the placebo group) and diarrhoea (11 [3%] vs 19 [6%]). There were seven deaths in each group, either during study treatment or within 30 days of discontinuing study treatment, which were the result of treatment-related adverse events. In the ramucirumab group, these adverse events were acute kidney injury, cardiac arrest, gastric haemorrhage, peritonitis, pneumothorax, septic shock, and sudden death (n=1 of each). In the placebo group, these adverse events were cerebrovascular accident (n=1), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (n=2), pulmonary embolism (n=2), sepsis (n=1), and small intestine perforation (n=1).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Although the primary analysis for progression-free survival was statistically significant, this outcome was not confirmed in a sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival by central independent review, and did not improve overall survival. Therefore, the addition of ramucirumab to cisplatin plus fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy is not recommended as first-line treatment for this patient population.

      Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes among patients with stable heart failure. However, the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors when initiated soon after an episode of decompensated heart failure are unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a multicenter, double-blind trial in which patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were recently hospitalized for worsening heart failure were randomly assigned to receive sotagliflozin or placebo. The primary end point was the total number of deaths from cardiovascular causes and hospitalizations and urgent visits for heart failure (first and subsequent events). The trial ended early because of loss of funding from the sponsor.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1222 patients underwent randomization (608 to the sotagliflozin group and 614 to the placebo group) and were followed for a median of 9.0 months; the first dose of sotagliflozin or placebo was administered before discharge in 48.8% and a median of 2 days after discharge in 51.2%. Among these patients, 600 primary end-point events occurred (245 in the sotagliflozin group and 355 in the placebo group). The rate (the number of events per 100 patient-years) of primary end-point events was lower in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group (51.0 vs. 76.3; hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.85; P<0.001). The rate of death from cardiovascular causes was 10.6 in the sotagliflozin group and 12.5 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.22); the rate of death from any cause was 13.5 in the sotagliflozin group and 16.3 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.14). Diarrhea was more common with sotagliflozin than with placebo (6.1% vs. 3.4%), as was severe hypoglycemia (1.5% vs. 0.3%). The percentage of patients with hypotension was similar in the sotagliflozin group and the placebo group (6.0% and 4.6%, respectively), as was the percentage with acute kidney injury (4.1% and 4.4%, respectively). The benefits of sotagliflozin were consistent in the prespecified subgroups of patients stratified according to the timing of the first dose.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with diabetes and recent worsening heart failure, sotagliflozin therapy, initiated before or shortly after discharge, resulted in a significantly lower total number of deaths from cardiovascular causes and hospitalizations and urgent visits for heart failure than placebo.

We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the role of perioperative PGE1 infusion in LDLT. Patients in the study arm received PGE1 (alprostadil) at the rate of 0.25 μg/kg/hour, starting at 1 hour after portal venous reperfusion, and continued for 96 hours. The primary endpoint was early allograft dysfunction (EAD). We analyzed multiple secondary endpoints including postoperative liver function and renal function parameters, acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), postoperative bleeding, overall mortality, and posttransplant hospital stay. The incidence of EAD was lower in the PGE1 arm, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (22.4% versus 36%; P = 0.21). Among the secondary endpoints, the incidence of AKI was significantly lower in the PGE1 arm (8.2% versus 28%; P = 0.02), as were the peak and mean postoperative creatinine levels. The need for renal replacement therapy was similar between the 2 groups. Among the postoperative graft function parameters, postoperative alanine aminotransferase level was significantly lower in the PGE1 arm (P = 0.04), whereas the remaining parameters including serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and international normalized ratio were similar between the 2 arms.

Vasoplegic hypotension may contribute to kidney injury, and different vasopressors may have variable effects on kidney function. We conducted a double-blind, randomised feasibility trial comparing peri-operative angiotensin-2 with noradrenaline. We randomly allocated 60 patients at two centres to a blinded equipotent angiotensin-2 or noradrenaline infusion intra-operatively and for up to 48 h postoperatively, titrated to mean arterial pressure of 70-80 mmHg. Primary feasibility outcomes included consent rate, protocol adherence, infusion duration, mean arterial pressure maintenance in the target range and major adverse outcomes. Secondary outcomes included kidney injury rate. The consent rate was 47%. Protocol adherence was 100% in the angiotensin-2 group and 94% in the noradrenaline group. Study drug duration was median (IQR [range]) 217 (160-270 [30-315]) vs. 185 (135-301 [0-480]) min (p = 0.78) min intra-operatively, and 5 (0-16 [0-48]) vs. 14.5 (4.8-29 [0-48]) hours (p = 0.075) postoperatively for angiotensin-2 and noradrenaline, respectively. The mean arterial pressure target was achieved postoperatively in 25 of 28 (89%) of the angiotensin-2 group and 27 of 32 (84%) of the noradrenaline group. One participant had a stroke, one required extracorporeal support and three required renal replacement therapy, all in the noradrenaline group (p = 0.99, p = 0.99 and p = 0.1). Acute kidney injury occurred in 7 of 28 in the angiotensin-2 group vs. 12 of 32 patients in the noradrenaline group (p = 0.31). This pilot study suggests that a trial comparing angiotensin-2 with noradrenaline is feasible. Its findings justify further investigations of angiotensin-2 in cardiac surgery."
"Thiamine as a Renal Protective Agent in Septic Shock. A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Trial.","Ari Moskowitz, Lars W Andersen, Michael N Cocchi, Mathias Karlsson, Parth V Patel, Michael W Donnino, Ari Moskowitzet al.",2017 May,Ann Am Thorac Soc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28207287/,No keywords found,"Rationale:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in patients with sepsis and has been associated with high mortality rates. The provision of thiamine to patients with sepsis may reduce the incidence and severity of sepsis-related AKI and thereby prevent renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT).
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To test the hypothesis that thiamine supplementation mitigates kidney injury in septic shock.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a secondary analysis of a single-center, randomized, double-blind trial comparing thiamine to placebo in patients with septic shock. Renal function, need for RRT, timing of hemodialysis catheter placement, and timing of RRT initiation were abstracted. The baseline creatinine and worst creatinine values between 3 and 24 hours, 24 and 48 hours, and 48 and 72 hours were likewise abstracted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 70 patients eligible for analysis after excluding 10 patients in whom hemodialysis was initiated before study drug administration. Baseline serum creatinine in the thiamine group was 1.2 mg/dl (interquartile range, 0.8-2.5) as compared with 1.8 mg/dl (interquartile range, 1.3-2.7) in the placebo group (P = 0.3). After initiation of the study drug, more patients in the placebo group than in the thiamine group were started on RRT (eight [21%] vs. one [3%]; P = 0.04). In the repeated measures analysis adjusting for the baseline creatinine level, the worst creatinine levels were higher in the placebo group than in the thiamine group (P = 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial, patients with septic shock randomized to receive thiamine had lower serum creatinine levels and a lower rate of progression to RRT than patients randomized to placebo. These findings should be considered hypothesis generating and can be used as a foundation for further, prospective investigation in this area."

      Metabolic acidosis is common in kidney transplant recipients and is associated with declining graft function. Sodium bicarbonate treatment effectively corrects metabolic acidosis, but no prospective studies have examined its effect on graft function. Therefore, we aimed to test whether sodium bicarbonate treatment would preserve graft function and slow the progression of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in kidney transplant recipients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Preserve-Transplant Study was a multicentre, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at three University Hospitals in Switzerland (Zurich, Bern, and Geneva), which recruited adult (aged ≥18 years) male and female long-term kidney transplant recipients if they had undergone transplantation more than 1 year ago. Key inclusion criteria were an estimated GFR between 15 mL/min per 1·73 m2 and 89 mL/min per 1·73 m2, stable allograft function in the last 6 months before study inclusion (<15% change in serum creatinine), and a serum bicarbonate of 22 mmol/L or less. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either oral sodium bicarbonate 1·5-4·5 g per day or matching placebo using web-based data management software. Randomisation was stratified by study centre and gender using a permuted block design to guarantee balanced allocation. We did multi-block randomisation with variable block sizes of two and four. Treatment duration was 2 years. Acid-resistant soft gelatine capsules of 500 mg sodium bicarbonate or matching 500 mg placebo capsules were given at an initial dose of 500 mg (if bodyweight was <70 kg) or 1000 mg (if bodyweight was ≥70 kg) three times daily. The primary endpoint was the estimated GFR slope over the 24-month treatment phase. The primary efficacy analyses were applied to a modified intention-to-treat population that comprised all randomly assigned participants who had a baseline visit. The safety population comprised all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03102996.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between June 12, 2017, and July 10, 2019, 1114 kidney transplant recipients with metabolic acidosis were assessed for trial eligibility. 872 patients were excluded and 242 were randomly assigned to the study groups (122 [50%] to the placebo group and 120 [50%] to the sodium bicarbonate group). After secondary exclusion of two patients, 240 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The calculated yearly estimated GFR slopes over the 2-year treatment period were a median -0·722 mL/min per 1·73 m2 (IQR -4·081 to 1·440) and mean -1·862 mL/min per 1·73 m2 (SD 6·344) per year in the placebo group versus median -1·413 mL/min per 1·73 m2 (IQR -4·503 to 1·139) and mean -1·830 mL/min per 1·73 m2 (SD 6·233) per year in the sodium bicarbonate group (Wilcoxon rank sum test p=0·51; Welch t-test p=0·97). The mean difference was 0·032 mL/min per 1·73 m2 per year (95% CI -1·644 to 1·707). There were no significant differences in estimated GFR slopes in a subgroup analysis and a sensitivity analysis confirmed the primary analysis. Although the estimated GFR slope did not show a significant difference between the treatment groups, treatment with sodium bicarbonate effectively corrected metabolic acidosis by increasing serum bicarbonate from 21·3 mmol/L (SD 2·6) to 23·0 mmol/L (2·7) and blood pH from 7·37 (SD 0·06) to 7·39 (0·04) over the 2-year treatment period. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in both groups. Three study participants died. In the placebo group, one (1%) patient died from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 and one (1%) from cardiac arrest after severe dehydration following diarrhoea with hypotension, acute kidney injury, and metabolic acidosis. In the sodium bicarbonate group, one (1%) patient had sudden cardiac death.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      In adult kidney transplant recipients, correction of metabolic acidosis by treatment with sodium bicarbonate over 2 years did not affect the decline in estimated GFR. Thus, treatment with sodium bicarbonate should not be generally recommended to preserve estimated GFR (a surrogate marker for graft function) in kidney transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease who have metabolic acidosis.

      Anesthesiologists administer excess supplemental oxygen (hyper-oxygenation) to patients during surgery to avoid hypoxia. Hyper-oxygenation, however, may increase the generation of reactive oxygen species and cause oxidative damage. In cardiac surgery, increased oxidative damage has been associated with postoperative kidney and brain injury. We hypothesize that maintenance of normoxia during cardiac surgery (physiologic oxygenation) decreases kidney injury and oxidative damage compared to hyper-oxygenation.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      The Risk of Oxygen during Cardiac Surgery (ROCS) trial will randomly assign 200 cardiac surgery patients to receive physiologic oxygenation, defined as the lowest fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) necessary to maintain an arterial hemoglobin saturation of 95 to 97%, or hyper-oxygenation (FIO2 = 1.0) during surgery. The primary clinical endpoint is serum creatinine change from baseline to postoperative day 2, and the primary mechanism endpoint is change in plasma concentrations of F2-isoprostanes and isofurans. Secondary endpoints include superoxide production, clinical delirium, myocardial injury, and length of stay. An endothelial function substudy will examine the effects of oxygen treatment and oxidative stress on endothelial function, measured using flow mediated dilation, peripheral arterial tonometry, and wire tension myography of epicardial fat arterioles.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The ROCS trial will test the hypothesis that intraoperative physiologic oxygenation decreases oxidative damage and organ injury compared to hyper-oxygenation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

Modifiable risk factors for postoperative AKI including perioperative anesthesia-related parameters were assessed. The authors conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of 220 patients (aged 10 days to 19 years) who underwent congenital cardiac surgery between January and December 2012. The incidence of AKI within 7 days postoperatively was determined using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Ninety-two patients (41.8%) developed AKI and 18 (8.2%) required renal replacement therapy within the first postoperative week. Among patients who developed AKI, 57 patients (25.9%) were KDIGO stage 1, 27 patients (12.3%) were KDIGO stage 2, and eight patients (3.6%) were KDIGO stage 3. RACHS-1 (Risk-Adjusted classification for Congenital Heart Surgery) category, perioperative transfusion and fluid administration as well as fluid overload were compared between patients with and without AKI. Multivariable logistic regression analyses determined the risk factors for AKI. AKI was associated with longer hospital stay or ICU stay, and frequent sternal wound infections. Younger age (<12 months) [odds ratio (OR), 4.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.77-9.06], longer cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.24-4.84), and low preoperative hemoglobin (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.07-5.40) were independent risk factors for AKI. Fluid overload was not a significant predictor for AKI. When a variable of hemoglobin concentration increase (>3 g/dl) from preoperative level on POD1 was entered into the multivariable analysis, it was independently associated with postoperative AKI (OR, 6.51; 95% CI, 2.23-19.03 compared with no increase). This association was significant after adjustment with patient demographics, medication history and RACHS-1 category (hemoglobin increase >3g/dl vs. no increase: adjusted OR, 6.94; 95% CI, 2.33-20.69), regardless of different age groups and cyanotic or non-cyanotic heart disease. Prospective trials are required to evaluate whether correction of preoperative anemia and prevention of hemoconcentration may ameliorate postoperative AKI in patients who underwent congenital cardiac surgery."

          Results:
        
      
      Of the enrolled 511 patients, 10 (2%) were lost to follow-up. CI-AKI occurred in 3.9% of patients (20/501). Median KIM-1 values were 1.2 (0.1 - 7.7) at baseline, 1.3 (0.1 - 8.6) at 4 - 6 h, and 1.3 ng/mg (0.1 - 8.1) at 48 - 96 h post CE-CT (P = 0.39). Median N-GAL values were 41.0 (4.4 - 3,174.4), 48.9 (5.7 - 3,406.1), and 37.8 μg/mg (3.5 - 3,200.4), respectively (P = 0.07). The amount of KIM-1 and N-GAL excretion in follow-up was similar for patients with and without CI-AKI (P-value KIM-1 0.08, P-value N-GAL 0.73). Neither patient characteristics at baseline including severe CKD, medication use, nor contrast dose were associated with increased excretion of KIM-1 or N-GAL during follow-up.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      KIM-1 and N-GAL excretion were unaffected by CE-CT both in patients with and without CI-AKI, suggesting that CI-AKI was not accompanied by tubular injury.
    


          Key points:
        
      
      • KIM-1 and N-GAL excretion were unaffected by intravenous contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT). • Patient or procedure characteristics were not associated with increased KIM-1 or N-GAL excretion. • Performance of CE-CT in CKD patients is likely to be safe."
Reliability of glomerular filtration rate estimating formulas compared to iohexol plasma clearance in critically ill children.,"Evelyn Dhont, Charlotte Windels, Evelien Snauwaert, Tatjana Van Der Heggen, Annick de Jaeger, Laura Dhondt, Joris Delanghe, Siska Croubels, Johan Vande Walle, Peter De Paepe, Pieter A De Cock, Evelyn Dhontet al.",2022 Nov,Eur J Pediatr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36053381/,No keywords found,"Accurate renal function assessment is crucial to guide intensive care decision-making and drug dosing. Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are routinely used in critically ill children; however, these formulas were never evaluated against measured GFR (mGFR) in this population. We aimed to assess the reliability of common eGFR formulas compared to iohexol plasma clearance (CLiohexol) in a pediatric intensive care (PICU) population. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (by pRIFLE criteria) and augmented renal clearance (ARC) (defined as standard GFR for age + 2 standard deviations (SD)) within 48 h after admission based on mGFR and eGFR by the revised Schwartz formula and the difference between these two methods to diagnose AKI and ARC. In children, between 0 and 15 years of age, without chronic renal disease, GFR was measured by CLiohexol and estimated using 26 formulas based on creatinine (Scr), cystatine C (CysC), and betatrace protein (BTP), early after PICU admission. eGFR and mGFR results were compared for the entire study population and in subgroups according to age, using Bland-Altman analysis with calculation of bias, precision, and accuracy expressed as percentage of eGFR results within 30% (P30) and 10% (P10) of mGFR. CLiohexol was measured in 98 patients. Mean CLiohexol (± SD) was 115 ± 54 ml/min/1.73m2. Most eGFR formulas showed overestimation of mGFR with large bias and poor precision reflected by wide limits of agreement (LoA). Bias was larger with CysC- and BTP-based formulas compared to Scr-based formulas. In the entire study population, none of the eGFR formulas showed the minimal desired P30 > 75%. The widely used revised Schwartz formula overestimated mGFR with a high percentage bias of - 18 ± 51% (95% confidence interval (CI) - 29; - 9), poor precision with 95% LoA from - 120 to 84% and insufficient accuracy reflected by P30 of only 51% (95% CI 41; 61), and P10 of 21% (95% CI 13; 66) in the overall population. Although performance of Scr-based formulas was worst in children below 1 month of age, exclusion of neonates and younger children did not result in improved agreement and accuracy. Based on mGFR, prevalence of AKI and ARC within 48 h was 17% and 45% of patients, respectively. There was poor agreement between revised Schwartz formula and mGFR to diagnose AKI (kappa value of 0.342, p < 0.001; sensitivity of 30%, 95% CI 5; 20%) and ARC (kappa value of 0.342, p < 0.001; sensitivity of 70%, 95% CI 33; 58).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this proof-of-concept study, eGFR formulas were found to be largely inaccurate in the PICU population. Clinicians should therefore use these formulas with caution to guide drug dosing and therapeutic interventions in critically ill children. More research in subgroup populations is warranted to conclude on generalizability of these study findings.

          What is known:
        
      
      • Both acute kidney injury and augmented renal clearance may be present in PICU patients and warrant adaptation of therapy, including drug dosing. • Biomarker-based eGFR formulas are widely used for GFR assessment in critically ill children, although endogenous filtration biomarkers have important limitations in PICU patients and eGFR formulas have never been validated against measured GFR in this population.
    


          What is new:
        
      
      • eGFR formulas were found to be largely inaccurate in the PICU population when compared to measured GFR by iohexol clearance. Clinicians should therefore use these formulas with caution to guide drug dosing and therapeutic interventions in critically ill children. • Iohexol plasma clearance could be considered an alternative for accurate GFR assessment in PICU patients."
An Organizational-Level Program of Intervention for AKI: A Pragmatic Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial.,"Nicholas M Selby, Anna Casula, Laura Lamming, John Stoves, Yohan Samarasinghe, Andrew J Lewington, Russell Roberts, Nikunj Shah, Melanie Johnson, Natalie Jackson, Carol Jones, Erik Lenguerrand, Eileen McDonach, Richard J Fluck, Mohammed A Mohammed, Fergus J Caskey, Nicholas M Selbyet al.",2019 Mar,J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31058607/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Variable standards of care may contribute to poor outcomes associated with AKI. We evaluated whether a multifaceted intervention (AKI e-alerts, an AKI care bundle, and an education program) would improve delivery of care and patient outcomes at an organizational level.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multicenter, pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial was performed in five UK hospitals, involving patients with AKI aged ≥18 years. The intervention was introduced sequentially across fixed three-month periods according to a randomly determined schedule until all hospitals were exposed. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, with pre-specified secondary endpoints and a nested evaluation of care process delivery. The nature of the intervention precluded blinding, but data collection and analysis were independent of project delivery teams.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We studied 24,059 AKI episodes, finding an overall 30-day mortality of 24.5%, with no difference between control and intervention periods. Hospital length of stay was reduced with the intervention (decreases of 0.7, 1.1, and 1.3 days at the 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 quantiles, respectively). AKI incidence increased and was mirrored by an increase in the proportion of patients with a coded diagnosis of AKI. Our assessment of process measures in 1048 patients showed improvements in several metrics including AKI recognition, medication optimization, and fluid assessment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A complex, hospital-wide intervention to reduce harm associated with AKI did not reduce 30-day AKI mortality but did result in reductions in hospital length of stay, accompanied by improvements in in quality of care. An increase in AKI incidence likely reflected improved recognition."
Biomarker-guided Intervention to Prevent Acute Kidney Injury After Major Surgery: The Prospective Randomized BigpAK Study.,"Ivan Göcze, Dominik Jauch, Markus Götz, Pascal Kennedy, Bettina Jung, Florian Zeman, Carsten Gnewuch, Bernhard M Graf, Wolfgang Gnann, Bernhard Banas, Thomas Bein, Hans J Schlitt, Tobias Bergler, Ivan Göczeet al.",2018 Jun,Ann Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28857811/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine the impact of renal biomarker-guided implementation of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) care bundle on the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) after major noncardiac surgery in a single-center unblinded randomized clinical trial.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Early optimization of volume status and discontinuation of nephrotoxic medication before the occurrence of AKI may be the crucial step to reduce preventable AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The urinary biomarker-triggered KDIGO care bundle (early optimization of fluid status, maintenance of perfusion pressure, discontinuation of nephrotoxic agents) was compared to standard intensive care unit (ICU) care in 121 patients with an increased AKI risk after major abdominal surgery that was determined by urinary biomarker (inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 × insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7) >0.3. Incidence of overall AKI, severity of AKI, length of stay, major kidney events at discharge, and cost effectiveness were evaluated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The overall stages of AKI were not statistically different between the 2 groups, but in patients with inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 × insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 values of 0.3 to 2.0 a subgroup analysis demonstrated a significantly reduced incidence of AKI 13/48 (27.1%) in the intervention group compared to control 24/50 (48.0%, P = 0.03). Incidence of moderate and severe AKI (P = 0.04), incidence of creatinine increase >25% of baseline value (P = 0.01), length of ICU, and hospital stay (P = 0.04) were significantly lower in the intervention group. Intervention was associated with cost reduction. There were no significant differences regarding renal replacement therapy, in-hospital mortality, or major kidney events at hospital discharge.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Early biomarker-based prediction of imminent AKI followed by implementation of KDIGO care bundle reduced AKI severity, postoperative creatinine increase, length of ICU, and hospital stay in patients after major noncardiac surgery."
"Sodium Bicarbonate Supplementation and Urinary TGF-β1 in Nonacidotic Diabetic Kidney Disease: A Randomized, Controlled Trial.","Kalani L Raphael, Tom Greene, Guo Wei, Tristin Bullshoe, Kunani Tuttle, Alfred K Cheung, Srinivasan Beddhu, Kalani L Raphaelet al.",2020 Feb 7,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31974286/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      In early-phase studies of individuals with hypertensive CKD and normal serum total CO2, sodium bicarbonate reduced urinary TGF-β1 levels and preserved kidney function. The effect of sodium bicarbonate on kidney fibrosis and injury markers in individuals with diabetic kidney disease and normal serum total CO2 is unknown.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 74 United States veterans with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, eGFR of 15-89 ml/min per 1.73 m2, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥30 mg/g, and serum total CO2 of 22-28 meq/L. Participants received oral sodium bicarbonate (0.5 meq/kg lean body wt per day; n=35) or placebo (n=39) for 6 months. The primary outcome was change in urinary TGF-β1-to-creatinine from baseline to months 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1)-to-creatinine, fibronectin-to-creatinine, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)-to-creatinine, and UACR from baseline to months 3 and 6.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Key baseline characteristics were age 72±8 years, eGFR of 51±18 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and serum total CO2 of 24±2 meq/L. Sodium bicarbonate treatment increased mean total CO2 by 1.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.3 to 2.1) meq/L, increased urinary pH by 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8), and decreased urinary ammonium excretion by 5 (95% CI, 0 to 11) meq/d and urinary titratable acid excretion by 11 (95% CI, 5 to 18) meq/d. Sodium bicarbonate did not significantly change urinary TGF-β1/creatinine (difference in change, 13%, 95% CI, -10% to 40%; change within the sodium bicarbonate group, 8%, 95% CI, -10% to 28%; change within the placebo group, -4%, 95% CI, -19% to 13%). Similarly, no significant effect on KIM-1-to-creatinine (difference in change, -10%, 95% CI, -38% to 31%), fibronectin-to-creatinine (8%, 95% CI, -15% to 37%), NGAL-to-creatinine (-33%, 95% CI, -56% to 4%), or UACR (1%, 95% CI, -25% to 36%) was observed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In nonacidotic diabetic kidney disease, sodium bicarbonate did not significantly reduce urinary TGF-β1, KIM-1, fibronectin, NGAL, or UACR over 6 months."
A Novel Method for Rapid Bedside Measurement of GFR.,"Dana V Rizk, Daniel Meier, Ruben M Sandoval, Teresa Chacana, Erinn S Reilly, Jesse C Seegmiller, Emmanuel DeNoia, James S Strickland, Joseph Muldoon, Bruce A Molitoris, Dana V Rizket al.",2018 Jun,J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29748326/,"Biomarker, FAST BioMedical, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, fluorescent glomerular filtration rate measurement, kidney function.","Background Direct quantitative measurement of GFR (mGFR) remains a specialized task primarily performed in research settings. Multiple formulas for estimating GFR have been developed that use the readily available endogenous biomarkers creatinine and/or cystatin C. However, eGFR formulas have limitations, and an accurate mGFR is necessary in some clinical situations and for certain patient populations. We conducted a prospective, open-label study to evaluate a novel rapid technique for determining plasma volume and mGFR.Methods We developed a new exogenous biomarker, visible fluorescent injectate (VFI), consisting of a large 150-kD rhodamine derivative and small 5-kD fluorescein carboxymethylated dextrans. After a single intravenous injection of VFI, plasma volume and mGFR can be determined on the basis of the plasma pharmacokinetics of the rhodamine derivative and fluorescein carboxymethylated dextrans, respectively. In this study involving 32 adults with normal kidney function (n=16), CKD stage 3 (n=8), or CKD stage 4 (n=8), we compared VFI-based mGFR values with values obtained by measuring iohexol plasma disappearance. VFI-based mGFR required three 0.5-ml blood draws over 3 hours; iohexol-based mGFR required five samples taken over 6 hours. Eight healthy participants received repeat VFI injections at 24 hours.Results VFI-based mGFR values showed close linear correlation with the iohexol-based mGFR values in all participants. Injections were well tolerated, including when given on consecutive days. No serious adverse events were reported. VFI-based mGFR was highly reproducible.Conclusions The VFI-based approach allows for the rapid determination of mGFR at the bedside while maintaining patient safety and measurement accuracy and reproducibility."
Prospective Trial on the Use of Trough Concentration versus Area under the Curve To Determine Therapeutic Vancomycin Dosing.,"Michael N Neely, Lauren Kato, Gilmer Youn, Lironn Kraler, David Bayard, Michael van Guilder, Alan Schumitzky, Walter Yamada, Brenda Jones, Emi Minejima, Michael N Neelyet al.",2018 Jan 25,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203493/,"Bayesian, clinical study, prospective, therapeutic drug monitoring, vancomycin.","We hypothesized that dosing vancomycin to achieve trough concentrations of >15 mg/liter overdoses many adults compared to area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-guided dosing. We conducted a 3-year, prospective study of vancomycin dosing, plasma concentrations, and outcomes. In year 1, nonstudy clinicians targeted trough concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/liter (infection dependent) and controlled dosing. In years 2 and 3, the study team controlled vancomycin dosing with BestDose Bayesian software to achieve a daily, steady-state AUC/MIC ratio of ≥400, with a maximum AUC value of 800 mg · h/liter, regardless of trough concentration. For Bayesian estimation of AUCs, we used trough samples in years 1 and 2 and optimally timed samples in year 3. We enrolled 252 adults who were ≥18 years old with ≥1 available vancomycin concentration. Only 19% of all trough concentrations were therapeutic versus 70% of AUCs (P < 0.0001). After enrollment, median trough concentrations by year were 14.4, 9.7, and 10.9 mg/liter (P = 0.005), with 36%, 7%, and 6% over 15 mg/liter (P < 0.0001). Bayesian AUC-guided dosing in years 2 and 3 was associated with fewer additional blood samples per subject (3.6, 2.0, and 2.4; P = 0.003), shorter therapy durations (8.2, 5.4, and 4.7 days; P = 0.03), and reduced nephrotoxicity (8%, 0%, and 2%; P = 0.01). The median inpatient stay was 20 days among nephrotoxic patients versus 6 days (P = 0.002). There was no difference in efficacy by year, with 42% of patients having microbiologically proven infections. Compared to trough concentration targets, AUC-guided, Bayesian estimation-assisted vancomycin dosing was associated with decreased nephrotoxicity, reduced per-patient blood sampling, and shorter length of therapy, without compromising efficacy. These benefits have the potential for substantial cost savings. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01932034.)."
Nephrologist Follow-Up versus Usual Care after an Acute Kidney Injury Hospitalization (FUSION): A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Samuel A Silver, Neill K Adhikari, Chaim M Bell, Christopher T Chan, Ziv Harel, Abhijat Kitchlu, Alejandro Meraz-Muñoz, Patrick A Norman, Adic Perez, Alireza Zahirieh, Ron Wald, Samuel A Silveret al.",2021 Jul,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34021031/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Survivors of AKI are at higher risk of CKD and death, but few patients see a nephrologist after hospital discharge. Our objectives during this 2-year vanguard phase trial were to determine the feasibility of randomizing survivors of AKI to early follow-up with a nephrologist or usual care, and to collect data on care processes and outcomes.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      We performed a randomized controlled trial in patients hospitalized with Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2-3 AKI at four hospitals in Toronto, Canada. We randomized patients to early nephrologist follow-up (standardized basket of care that emphasized BP control, cardiovascular risk reduction, and medication safety) or usual care from July 2015 to June 2017. Feasibility outcomes included the proportion of eligible patients enrolled, seen by a nephrologist, and followed to 1 year. The primary clinical outcome was a major adverse kidney event at 1 year, defined as death, maintenance dialysis, or incident/progressive CKD.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We screened 3687 participants from July 2015 to June 2017, of whom 269 were eligible. We randomized 71 (26%) patients (34 to nephrology follow-up and 37 to usual care). The primary reason stated for declining enrollment included hospitalization-related fatigue (n=65), reluctance to add more doctors to the health care team (n=59), and long travel times (n=40). Nephrologist visits occurred in 24 of 34 (71%) intervention participants, compared with three of 37 (8%) participants randomized to usual care. The primary clinical outcome occurred in 15 of 34 (44%) patients in the nephrologist follow-up arm, and 16 of 37 (43%) patients in the usual care arm (relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 1.73).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Major adverse kidney events are common in AKI survivors, but we found the in-person model of follow-up posed a variety of barriers that was not acceptable to many patients.

Targeting Higher Intraoperative Blood Pressures Does Not Reduce Adverse Cardiovascular Events Following Noncardiac Surgery.,"Patrick M Wanner, Dirk U Wulff, Mirjana Djurdjevic, Wolfgang Korte, Thomas W Schnider, Miodrag Filipovic, Patrick M Wanneret al.",2021 Nov 2,J Am Coll Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34711333/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intraoperative arterial hypotension is strongly associated with postoperative major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); however, whether targeting higher intraoperative mean arterial blood pressures (MAPs) may prevent adverse events remains unclear.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study sought to determine whether targeting higher intraoperative MAP lowers the incidence of postoperative MACE.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This single-center randomized controlled trial assigned adult patients at cardiovascular risk undergoing major noncardiac surgery to an intraoperative MAP target of ≥60 mm Hg (control) or ≥75 mm Hg (MAP ≥75). The primary outcome was acute myocardial injury on postoperative days 0-3 and/or 30-day MACE/acute kidney injury (AKI) (acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure, coronary revascularization, stroke, AKI, and all-cause mortality). The secondary outcome was 1-year MACE.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 458 patients were randomized (intention-to-treat population: 451). The cumulative intraoperative duration with MAP <65 mm Hg was significantly shorter in the MAP ≥75 group (median 9 minutes [interquartile range: 3 to 24 minutes] vs 23 minutes [interquartile range: 8-49 minutes]; P < 0.001). The primary outcome incidence was 48% for MAP ≥75 and 52% for control (risk difference -4.2%; 95% CI: -13% to +5%), the primary contributor being AKI (incidence 44%). Acute myocardial injury occurred in 15% (MAP ≥75) and 19% (control) of patients. The secondary outcome incidence was 17% for MAP ≥75 and 15% for control (risk difference +2.7; 95% CI: -4% to +9.5%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These findings do not support universally targeting higher intraoperative blood pressures to reduce postoperative complications. Despite a 60% reduction in hypotensive time with MAP <65 mm Hg, no significant reductions in acute myocardial injury or 30-day MACE/AKI could be found.

      Participants were randomized to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group, n = 1317) or an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group, n = 1319).
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary cardiovascular disease outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in a myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute decompensated heart failure, and death from cardiovascular causes. All-cause mortality was a secondary outcome.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 2636 participants (mean age, 79.9 years; 37.9% women), 2510 (95.2%) provided complete follow-up data. At a median follow-up of 3.14 years, there was a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome (102 events in the intensive treatment group vs 148 events in the standard treatment group; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.51-0.85]) and all-cause mortality (73 deaths vs 107 deaths, respectively; HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.49-0.91]). The overall rate of serious adverse events was not different between treatment groups (48.4% in the intensive treatment group vs 48.3% in the standard treatment group; HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.89-1.11]). Absolute rates of hypotension were 2.4% in the intensive treatment group vs 1.4% in the standard treatment group (HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.97-3.09]), 3.0% vs 2.4%, respectively, for syncope (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.76-2.00]), 4.0% vs 2.7% for electrolyte abnormalities (HR, 1.51 [95% CI, 0.99-2.33]), 5.5% vs 4.0% for acute kidney injury (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.98-2.04]), and 4.9% vs 5.5% for injurious falls (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.65-1.29]).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among ambulatory adults aged 75 years or older, treating to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg compared with an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg resulted in significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause.

      Vancomycin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic to treat gram-positive infections. The efficacy of vancomycin is known to be directly related to the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) divided by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen. However, in most countries, steady-state plasma concentrations are used as a surrogate parameter of target AUC/MIC, but this practice has some drawbacks. Hence, direct AUC-guided monitoring of vancomycin using model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) tools has been proposed for earlier attainment of target concentrations and reducing vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity. However, solid scientific evidence for these benefits in clinical practice is still lacking. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to investigate the clinical utility of MIPD dosing of vancomycin administered via continuous infusion in hospitalized adults.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants from 11 wards at two Belgian hospitals are randomly allocated to the intervention group or the standard-of-care comparator group. In the intervention group, clinical pharmacists perform dose calculations using CE-labeled MIPD software and target an AUC24h of 400 to 600 mg × h/L, whereas patients in the comparator group receive standard-of-care dosing and monitoring according to the institutional guidelines. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients reaching the target AUC24h/MIC of 400-600 between 48 and 72 h after start of vancomycin treatment. Secondary endpoints are the proportion of patients with (worsening) acute kidney injury (AKI) during and until 48 h after stop of vancomycin treatment, the proportion of patients reaching target AUC24h/MIC of 400-600 between 72 and 96 h after start of vancomycin treatment, and the proportion of time within the target AUC24h/MIC of 400-600.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This trial will clarify the propagated benefits and provide new insights into how to optimally monitor vancomycin treatment.

Serum-creatinine, serum cystatin-C, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula, and estimated creatinine clearance rate (eCCr) using the Cockcroft-Gault formula were measured just before and 16-80 hr after MRI. Groups were compared statistically by Mann-Whitney U-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the gadodiamide (n = 43) and gadopentetate (n = 59) groups. Serum-creatinine, eGFR and eCCr before and 16-80 hr after MRI did not differ significantly within either group or between the two groups.

Practice of Extracorporeal Therapies for Septic Acute Kidney Injury Patients in Intensive Care Units in Mainland China.,"Yu Zhou, Fachun Zhou, Xue Wang, Ping Chang, Ling Zhang, Qiang Yao, Jacques Goldstein, Xinyu Liu, Minmin Wang, Yu Zhouet al.",2019:47 Suppl 3:1-6.,Blood Purif,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30982039/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and other extracorporeal therapies for acute kidney injury (AKI) and other organ dysfunction syndromes in critically ill patients are common in the intensive care unit (ICU). Many studies have focused on clinical practice for managing these conditions. However, there are few studies that describe the utilization of extracorporeal therapies, especially CRRT, in patients with sepsis-associated AKI.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Two hundred ICU physicians were included in a survey from February 28, 2017, to March 20, 2017, on the current status of septic AKI and clinical practice in CRRT. According to the responses, 40% of sepsis patients in the ICU had AKI, and 25% required extracorporeal therapies. However, 29% of candidates gave up therapy for medical or nonmedical reasons. Overall survival for sepsis was 60%; among survivors, 80% were dialysis free at discharge. CRRT was the most common modality of extracorporeal therapy in the ICU, and 82% of physicians chose convection as the major clearance mode. The survey showed 30% of physicians saw the removal of inflammatory mediators as the major objective of extracorporeal therapies; however, only 18.5% of physicians considered inflammation as a measure to trigger CRRT. The median treatment duration of CRRT in China was 12 h per day for 5 days. Key Messages: There were some similarities and differences in CRRT practice for septic AKI patients in China and globally. The differences reveal some insights into improving the outcomes of these patients."

      To determine whether electronic health record alerts for acute kidney injury would improve patient outcomes of mortality, dialysis, and progression of acute kidney injury.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Double blinded, multicenter, parallel, randomized controlled trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Six hospitals (four teaching and two non-teaching) in the Yale New Haven Health System in Connecticut and Rhode Island, US, ranging from small community hospitals to large tertiary care centers.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      6030 adult inpatients with acute kidney injury, as defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      An electronic health record based ""pop-up"" alert for acute kidney injury with an associated acute kidney injury order set upon provider opening of the patient's medical record.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      A composite of progression of acute kidney injury, receipt of dialysis, or death within 14 days of randomization. Prespecified secondary outcomes included outcomes at each hospital and frequency of various care practices for acute kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      6030 patients were randomized over 22 months. The primary outcome occurred in 653 (21.3%) of 3059 patients with an alert and in 622 (20.9%) of 2971 patients receiving usual care (relative risk 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.13, P=0.67). Analysis by each hospital showed worse outcomes in the two non-teaching hospitals (n=765, 13%), where alerts were associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome (relative risk 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.98, P=0.006). More deaths occurred at these centers (15.6% in the alert group v 8.6% in the usual care group, P=0.003). Certain acute kidney injury care practices were increased in the alert group but did not appear to mediate these outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Alerts did not reduce the risk of our primary outcome among patients in hospital with acute kidney injury. The heterogeneity of effect across clinical centers should lead to a re-evaluation of existing alerting systems for acute kidney injury.

A novel strategy for identifying early acute kidney injury in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Stefanie W Benoit, Bradley P Dixon, Stuart L Goldstein, Michael R Bennett, Adam Lane, Dana T Lounder, Seth J Rotz, Nicholas J Gloude, Kelly E Lake, Bridget Litts, Stella M Davies, Stefanie W Benoitet al.",2019 Sep,Bone Marrow Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30700793/,No keywords found,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Serum creatinine is an imprecise biomarker of AKI. We hypothesized that combining creatinine with serum cystatin C (cysC) and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) more effectively characterizes AKI during the first 28 days of HSCT and better identifies patients at risk of adverse outcomes than creatinine alone. We prospectively assessed the type and severity of AKI in 80 consecutive allogeneic HSCT patients using weekly creatinine, cysC, and NGAL. We combined the biomarkers to define 7 Composite Types of AKI, including All Positive AKI (simultaneously detected creatinine, cysC, and NGAL AKI). Outcomes included renal replacement therapy and transplant-related mortality. In all, 75% of patients had AKI by at least one measure; 33% developed >1 type of AKI. Mild AKI often preceded Severe AKI. Patients with creatinine or NGAL AKI that were Severe or Repeated tended to have worse outcomes. The five patients with All Positive AKI had the highest rates of morbidity and mortality. AKI evaluation with creatinine, cysC, and NGAL provides a comprehensive profile of early AKI and narrowly identifies patients at highest risk of adverse outcomes, providing opportunities for early, impactful intervention."

However, the effectiveness of clinical pathway in management of acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been reported. Therefore, we aimed to assess the length of hospital stay (LOS) and patient-centered outcomes in community acquired AKI and compared pathway care (PC) versus usual care (UC). The CHAMP-Path AKI Trial is a pragmatic, parallel, single-blind randomized controlled trial. Physicians were randomized to provide either UC or PC. Patients were randomized through a computer-generated sequence. Allocation was concealed. Patients presenting to the emergency department with AKI and hemodynamic stability, who were over 14 years with a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 times the baseline were eligible. Patients with chronic kidney disease stages 4 or 5, kidney transplantation recipients, those admitted with obstructive uropathy, suspected glomerular or interstitial disease, and pregnant women were excluded. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled from March 2012 to December 2013. The primary outcome was LOS. Secondary outcomes included: 30-day readmission, in-hospital mortality, determinants of LOS, and patient-centered outcomes. Eighteen patients were randomized to PC, and 20 to UC. Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, the median LOS was 4.96 [interquartile range (IQR) 6.57] and 4.80 days (IQR 6.84) for PC and UC, respectively (P = 0.770). Of the five readmissions, none were for AKI. No in-hospital mortality was reported. The CHAMP-Path AKI pragmatic trial demonstrated that PC was not different than UC in reducing LOS.

Urinary biomarkers TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 early predict acute kidney injury after major surgery.,"Ivan Gocze, Matthias Koch, Philipp Renner, Florian Zeman, Bernhard M Graf, Marc H Dahlke, Michael Nerlich, Hans J Schlitt, John A Kellum, Thomas Bein, Ivan Goczeet al.",2015 Mar 23,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25798585/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To assess the ability of the urinary biomarkers IGFBP7 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7) and TIMP-2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2) to early predict acute kidney injury (AKI) in high-risk surgical patients.
    


          Introduction:
        
      
      Postoperative AKI is associated with an increase in short and long-term mortality. Using IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 for early detection of cellular kidney injury, thus allowing the early initiation of renal protection measures, may represent a new concept of evaluating renal function.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective study, urinary [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] was measured in surgical patients at high risk for AKI. A predefined cut-off value of [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] >0.3 was used for assessing diagnostic accuracy. Perioperative characteristics were evaluated, and ROC analyses as well as logistic regression models of risk assessment were calculated with and without a [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      107 patients were included in the study, of whom 45 (42%) developed AKI. The highest median values of biomarker were detected in septic, transplant and patients after hepatic surgery (1.24 vs 0.45 vs 0.47 ng/l²/1000). The area under receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the risk of any AKI was 0.85, for early use of RRT 0.83 and for 28-day mortality 0.77. In a multivariable model with established perioperative risk factors, the [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] test was the strongest predictor of AKI and significantly improved the risk assessment (p<0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Urinary [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] test sufficiently detect patients with risk of AKI after major non-cardiac surgery. Due to its rapid responsiveness it extends the time frame for intervention to prevent development of AKI."
Development and validation of a predictive model for acute kidney injury in patients with moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis.,"Dongliang Yang#, Li Zhao#, Jian Kang, Chao Wen, Yuanhao Li, Yanbo Ren, Hui Wang, Su Zhang, Suosuo Yang, Jing Song, Dongna Gao, Yuling Li, Dongliang Yanget al.",2022 Aug,Clin Exp Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35430680/,No keywords found,"Background:

          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with a diagnosis of MSAP and SAP admitted to our hospital from January 2018 to December 2021 were retrospectively included in the study. The participants were divided into the training and validation cohorts randomly, in a 2:1 ratio. A clinical signature was built based on reproducible features, using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method and machine learning. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to develop the prediction model. Nomogram performance was determined by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 996 eligible patients were enrolled. 698 patients were allocated in the training cohort and 298 in the validation cohort. AKI occurred in 148 patients (21%) in the training cohort and 54 (18%) in the validation cohort, respectively. The clinical features, including C-reactive protein, intra-abdominal pressure and serum cysC, were significantly associated with AKI as well as severe AKI. The nomogram showed favorable discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The novel risk score model has good performance for predicting AKI and severe AKI in MSAP and SAP patients. Application of this model can help clinicians stratify patients for primary prevention, surveillance and early therapeutic intervention to improve care and prognosis."

      This is a retrospective cohort study. Adults who underwent noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia from 2007 to 2011 at Nara Medical University Hospital were included. Those with obstetric or urological surgery, missing data for analyses or pre-operative dialysis were excluded. Exposure of interest was pre-operative proteinuria, defined as (+) or more by dipstick test. The outcome variable was post-operative AKI, defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria, within 1 week after surgery. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 5168 subjects, 309 (6.0%) developed AKI. Pre-operative proteinuria was independently associated with post-operative AKI, with an odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 1.80 (1.30-2.51). A sensitivity analysis restricted to elective surgery yielded a similar result. As proteinuria increased, the association with AKI became stronger [OR (95% CI) 1.14 (0.75-1.73), 1.24 (0.79-1.95), 2.75 (1.74-4.35) and 3.95 (1.62-9.62) for urinary protein (+/-), (+), (2+) and (3+), respectively]. Subgroup analyses showed proteinuria was especially associated with post-operative AKI among subjects with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, other anti-hypertensives, hypoalbuminemia or impaired renal function (P for interaction = 0.05, 0.003, 0.09 or 0.02, respectively).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In noncardiac surgery, pre-operative proteinuria was independently associated with post-operative AKI. Subjects with proteinuria should be managed with caution to avoid AKI peri-operatively."

A total of 67 consecutive patients who had undergone HT between January 2012 and December 2014 were assessed. After exclusion of some patients, 23 patients were given preoperative 2 g fibrinogen concentrate over a period of 15 minutes after the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass pump and complete reversal of heparin, and 30 patients were not given. Some laboratories were measured before general anesthesia and at 6 and 24 hours after surgery. In addition, major adverse events were also evaluated during hospitalization. The mean age of the patients was 39.5 ± 11.4 years, with a predominance of male sex (77.4%). All laboratories at baseline were comparable between groups. The length of hospital stay was longer in the control group compared to the fibrinogen group (20 [16-22] vs 16 [12-19] days; P = .005). There was a trend for patients in the fibrinogen group to have more acute kidney injury (AKI) after surgery (10% vs 30.4%) and less reoperation for bleeding (20% vs 8.7%). The amount of postoperative bleeding was significantly higher in the control group compared to the fibrinogen group ( P < .001). The number of packed red blood cell transfused during 24 hours after surgery was significantly lower in the fibrinogen group ( P < .001). The transfusion of fibrinogen in patients undergoing HT may be associated with reductions in postoperative bleeding, the number of packed red blood cells, and hospital length of stay; however, it may enhance postoperative AKI."

      Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the recommended modality of dialysis for critically ill patients with hemodynamic instability. Yet there remains significant variability in how CRRT is prescribed and delivered, and limited evidence-basis to guide practice.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a prospective, multi-center observational study of patients undergoing CRRT. Initial enrollment phase will occur at 4 academic medical centers in North America over 5 years, with a target enrollment of 2000 patients. All adult patients (18-89 years of age) receiving CRRT will be eligible for inclusion; patients who undergo CRRT for less than 24 h will be excluded from analysis. Data collection will include patient characteristics at baseline and at time of CRRT initiation; details of CRRT prescription and delivery, including machine-generated treatment data; and patient outcomes.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The goal of this study is to establish a large comprehensive registry of critically ill adults receiving CRRT. Specific aims include describing variations in CRRT prescription and delivery across quality domains; validating quality measures for CRRT care by correlating processes and outcomes; and establishing a large registry for use in quality improvement and benchmarking efforts. For initial analyses, some particular areas of interest are anticoagulation protocols; approach to fluid overload; CRRT-related workload; and patient safety.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of perioperative administration of N-acetylcysteine, selenium and vitamin C on the incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury after off-pump coronary bypass graft surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      291 patients requiring elective off-pump coronary bypass graft surgery were randomized to receive either N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C and selenium 600 mg, 1500 mg, 0.5 mg, and nothing orally twice a day, respectively, from the day before to 2 days after surgery. They were assessed for the development of acute kidney injury using Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria, time of onset, its severity and duration, duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      272 patients completed the study. The total incidence of acute kidney injury was 22.1% (n=60) with 14 (20.9%), 15 (22.1%), 21 (31.8%), and 10 (14.1%) patients in the vitamin C, NAC, selenium, and control groups, respectively (P=0.096). We did not register significant differences in the incidence, the time of occurrence, the severity and the duration of acute kidney injury, as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation, the intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and the in-hospital mortality among the four groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We found that perioperative administration of N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C and selenium were not effective in preventing acute kidney injury and associated morbidity and mortality after off-pump coronary bypass graft surgery."
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) fails as an early predictor of contrast induced nephropathy in chronic kidney disease (ANTI-CI-AKI study).,"Werner Ribitsch, Gernot Schilcher, Franz Quehenberger, Stefan Pilz, Rupert H Portugaller, Martini Truschnig-Wilders, Robert Zweiker, Marianne Brodmann, Philipp Stiegler, Alexander R Rosenkranz, John W Pickering, Joerg H Horina, Werner Ribitschet al.",2017 Jan 27:7:41300.,Sci Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28128223/,No keywords found,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of urinary neutrophil gelatinase- associated lipocalin (uNGAL) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) as an early biomarker for contrast induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) and to investigate whether patients with an uNGAL increase might benefit from an additional intravenous volume expansion with regard to CI-AKI-incidence. We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial in 617 CKD-patients undergoing intra-arterial angiography. Urinary NGAL was measured the day before and 4-6hrs after angiography. In the event of a significant rise of uNGAL patients were randomized either into Group A, who received intravenous saline post procedure or Group B, who did not receive post-procedural i.v. fluids. Ten patients (1.62%) exhibited a significant rise of uNGAL after angiography and were randomized of whom one developed a CI-AKI. In the entire cohort the incidence of CI-AKI was 9.4% (58 patients) resulting in a specificity of 98.4% (95% CI: 97.0-99.3%) and a sensitivity of 1.72% (95% CI: 0.044-9.2%) of uNGAL for the diagnosis of CI-AKI. In this study uNGAL failed to predict CI-AKI and was an inadequate triage tool to guide an early intervention strategy to prevent CI-AKI.

      A prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 80 patients were included and randomly divided into two groups. Moreover, coagulation indices, liver function indices, renal function indices, and SOFA and APACHE II scores did not significantly differ between the two groups (P > 0.05). The coagulation grade of the venous ports in the experimental group was lower than that in the control group and the two groups of filters, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.337). Both sodium citrate solution infusion methods maintained a low blood calcium concentration (0.25-0.45 mmol/L) in the peripheral circulation pathway, and no patient developed hypocalcaemia (< 1.0 mmol/L). The lifespans of the extracorporeal circulation tube in the experimental group and the control group were 69.43 ± 1.49 h and 49.39 ± 2.44 h, respectively (t = 13.316, P = 0.001).

Value of electronic alerts for acute kidney injury in high-risk wards: a pilot randomized controlled trial.,"Yanhua Wu, Yuanhan Chen, Shaowen Li, Wei Dong, Huaban Liang, Miaoyi Deng, Yingnan Chen, Shixin Chen, Xinling Liang, Yanhua Wuet al.",2018 Aug,Int Urol Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29556903/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      To investigate the application value of ""electronic alerts"" (""e-alerts"") for acute kidney injury (AKI) among high-risk wards of hospitals.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted. We developed an e-alert system for AKI and ran the system in intensive care units and divisions focusing on cardiovascular disease. The e-alert system diagnosed AKI automatically based on serum creatinine levels. Patients were assigned randomly to an e-alert group (467 patients) or non-e-alert group (408 patients). Only the e-alert group could receive pop-up messages.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The sensitivity, specificity, Youden Index and accuracy of the AKI e-alert system were 99.8, 97.7, 97.5 and 98.1%, respectively. The prevalence of the diagnosis for AKI and expanded-AKI (AKI or multiple-organ failure) in the e-alert group was higher than that in the non-e-alert group (AKI 7.9 and 2.7%, P = 0.001; expanded-AKI 16.3 and 6.1%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of nephrology consultation in the e-alert group was higher than that in the non-e-alert group (9.0 and 3.7%, P = 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence dialysis, rehabilitation of renal function or death in the two groups.

      The e-alert system described here was a reliable tool to make an accurate diagnosis of AKI."
Volume control strategy and patient survival in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury receiving continuous renal replacement therapy: a randomized controlled trial with secondary analysis.,"Cheol Ho Park, Hee Byung Koh, Jin Hyeog Lee, Hui-Yun Jung, Joohyung Ha, Hyung Woo Kim, Jung Tak Park, Seung Hyeok Han, Shin-Wook Kang, Tae-Hyun Yoo, Cheol Ho Parket al.",2024 Jun 21,Sci Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38902283/,"Bioelectrical impedance analysis, Continuous renal replacement therapy, Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury, Volume control.","Optimal strategy for volume control and the clinical implication of achieved volume control are unknown in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the survival according to conventional or bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-guided volume control strategy in patients with sepsis-associated AKI receiving CRRT. We also compared patient survival according to achieved volume accumulation rate ([cumulative fluid balance during 3 days × 100]/fluid overload measured by BIA at enrollment) as a post-hoc analysis. We randomly assigned patients to conventional volume control strategy (n = 39) or to BIA-guided volume control strategy (n = 34).

      Studies that have evaluated the use of intravenous vitamin C in adults with sepsis who were receiving vasopressor therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU) have shown mixed results with respect to the risk of death and organ dysfunction.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned adults who had been in the ICU for no longer than 24 hours, who had proven or suspected infection as the main diagnosis, and who were receiving a vasopressor to receive an infusion of either vitamin C (at a dose of 50 mg per kilogram of body weight) or matched placebo administered every 6 hours for up to 96 hours. The primary outcome was a composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction (defined by the use of vasopressors, invasive mechanical ventilation, or new renal-replacement therapy) on day 28.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 872 patients underwent randomization (435 to the vitamin C group and 437 to the control group). The primary outcome occurred in 191 of 429 patients (44.5%) in the vitamin C group and in 167 of 434 patients (38.5%) in the control group (risk ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.40; P = 0.01). At 28 days, death had occurred in 152 of 429 patients (35.4%) in the vitamin C group and in 137 of 434 patients (31.6%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.40) and persistent organ dysfunction in 39 of 429 patients (9.1%) and 30 of 434 patients (6.9%), respectively (risk ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.83 to 2.05). Findings were similar in the two groups regarding organ-dysfunction scores, biomarkers, 6-month survival, health-related quality of life, stage 3 acute kidney injury, and hypoglycemic episodes. In the vitamin C group, one patient had a severe hypoglycemic episode and another had a serious anaphylaxis event.

This study compares urinary calprotectin, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) for their performance in predicting mortality and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in pediatric AKI patients. Urinary biomarker concentrations were assessed prospectively in 141 subjects aged 0-18 years including 55 patients with established AKI according to pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease (pRIFLE) criteria, 27 patients without AKI, and 59 healthy children. Within the AKI group, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed moderate to poor performance of calprotectin and KIM-1 in the prediction of 30-day mortality (calprotectin area under the curve (AUC) 0.55; KIM-1 AUC 0.55) and 3-month mortality (calprotectin AUC 0.61; KIM-1 AUC 0.60) and fair performance in the prediction of RRT requirement (calprotectin AUC 0.72; KIM-1 AUC 0.71). Urinary NGAL showed good performance in predicting 30-day (AUC 0.79) and 3-month (AUC 0.81) mortality and moderate performance in predicting RRT (AUC 0.61).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Whereas urinary calprotectin and KIM-1 can be useful for the prediction of RRT, urinary NGAL has a good diagnostic performance in predicting mortality in pediatric patients with AKI of heterogeneous etiology. What is known: • There is increasing evidence that urinary biomarkers like neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) are valuable for the prediction of adverse outcome in adult acute kidney injury (AKI), whereas data on pediatric AKI is scarce. What is new: • Urinary calprotectin and KIM-1 do not predict mortality in our heterogeneous pediatric AKI cohort, but they show moderate performance in the prediction of dialysis. • Urinary NGAL is a good predictor of mortality performing better than pRIFLE stage, eGFR, or creatinine, but it shows moderate performance in the prediction of dialysis."
"Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Prevents Postoperative Acute Kidney Injury After Open Total Aortic Arch Replacement: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Sham-Controlled Trial.","Hui Zhou, Lijing Yang, Guyan Wang, Congya Zhang, Zhongrong Fang, Guiyu Lei, Sheng Shi, Jun Li, Hui Zhouet al.",2019 Jul,Anesth Analg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30896603/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury is a common complication after open total aortic arch replacement but lacks effective preventive strategies. Remote ischemic preconditioning has controversial results of its benefit to the kidney and may perform better in high-risk patients of acute kidney injury. We investigated whether remote ischemic preconditioning would prevent postoperative acute kidney injury after open total aortic arch replacement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We enrolled 130 patients scheduled for open total aortic arch replacement and randomized them to receive either remote ischemic preconditioning (4 cycles of 5-minute right upper limb ischemia and 5-minute reperfusion) or sham preconditioning (4 cycles of 5-minute right upper limb pseudo ischemia and 5-minute reperfusion), both via blood pressure cuff inflation and deflation. The primary end point was the incidence of acute kidney injury within 7 days after the surgery defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Secondary end point included short-term clinical outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Significantly fewer patients developed postoperative acute kidney injury with remote ischemic preconditioning compared with sham (55.4% vs 73.8%; absolute risk reduction, 18.5%; 95% CI, 2.3%-34.6%; P = .028). Remote ischemic preconditioning significantly reduced acute kidney injury stage II-III (10.8% vs 35.4%; P = .001). Remote ischemic preconditioning shortened the mechanical ventilation duration (18 hours [interquartile range, 14-33] versus 25 hours [interquartile range, 17-48]; P = .01), whereas no significant differences were observed between groups in other secondary outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Remote ischemic preconditioning prevented acute kidney injury after open total aortic arch replacement, especially severe acute kidney injury and shortened mechanical ventilation duration. The observed renoprotective effects of remote ischemic preconditioning require further investigation in both clinical research and the underlying mechanism."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after cardiac surgery. This study aims to develop and validate a risk model for predicting AKI after cardiac valve replacement surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from patients undergoing surgical valve replacement between January 2015 and December 2018 in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The subjects were randomly divided into a derivation cohort and a validation cohort at a ratio of 7:3. The primary outcome was defined as AKI within 7 days after surgery. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to select risk predictors for developing the prediction model. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC), calibration plot and clinical decision curve analysis (DCA) will be used to evaluate the discrimination, precision and clinical benefit of the prediction model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1159 patients were involved in this study. The prevalence of AKI following surgery was 37.0% (429/1159). Logistic regression analysis showed that age, hemoglobin, fibrinogen, serum uric acid, cystatin C, bicarbonate, and cardiopulmonary bypass time were independent risk factors associated with AKI after surgical valve replacement (all P < 0.05). The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) in the derivation cohort and the validation cohort were 0.777 (95% CI 0.744-0.810) and 0.760 (95% CI 0.706-0.813), respectively. The calibration plots indicated excellent consistency between the prediction probability and actual probability. DCA demonstrated great clinical benefit of the prediction model.

Urinary Glycosaminoglycans Predict Outcomes in Septic Shock and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.,"Eric P Schmidt, Katherine H Overdier, Xiaojun Sun, Lei Lin, Xinyue Liu, Yimu Yang, Lee Anne Ammons, Terra D Hiller, Matt A Suflita, Yanlei Yu, Yin Chen, Fuming Zhang, Clay Cothren Burlew, Charles L Edelstein, Ivor S Douglas, Robert J Linhardt, Eric P Schmidtet al.",2016 Aug 15,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26926297/,No keywords found,"Rationale:
        
      
      Degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx, a glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-rich layer lining the vascular lumen, is associated with the onset of kidney injury in animal models of critical illness. It is unclear if similar pathogenic degradation occurs in critically ill patients.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To determine if urinary indices of GAG fragmentation are associated with outcomes in patients with critical illnesses such as septic shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We prospectively collected urine from 30 patients within 24 hours of admission to the Denver Health Medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for septic shock. As a nonseptic ICU control, we collected urine from 25 surgical ICU patients admitted for trauma. As a medical ICU validation cohort, we obtained serially collected urine samples from 70 patients with ARDS. We performed mass spectrometry on urine samples to determine GAG (heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid) concentrations as well as patterns of heparan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate disaccharide sulfation. We compared these indices to measurements obtained using dimethylmethylene blue, an inexpensive, colorimetric urinary assay of sulfated GAGs.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      In septic shock, indices of GAG fragmentation correlated with both the development of renal dysfunction over the 72 hours after urine collection and with hospital mortality. This association remained after controlling for severity of illness and was similarly observed using the inexpensive dimethylmethylene blue assay. These predictive findings were corroborated using urine samples previously collected at three consecutive time points from patients with ARDS.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Early indices of urinary GAG fragmentation predict acute kidney injury and in-hospital mortality in patients with septic shock or ARDS. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01900275)."

          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients in group D were administered 0.6 μg/kg/h of dexmedetomidine intravenously from 10 minutes before anesthesia induction to 6 hours after surgery; normal saline was used instead of dexmedetomidine in group C.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      The primary outcome was the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Acute kidney injury was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (2012). It was 22.86% and 48.57% in groups D and C, respectively (p = 0.025). The secondary outcomes were intraoperative hemodynamics and various indices in serum. Ten minutes before CPB (T1), 10 minutes after CPB (T2), and 30 minutes after CPB (T3), mean arterial pressure in group D was lower than that in group C, with statistical significance (74.94 ± 8.52 v 81.89 ± 13.66 mmHg, p=0.013; 62.83 ± 11.27 v 71.86 ± 7.89 mmHg, p < 0.001; 72.26 ± 8.75 v 78.57 ± 8.83 mmHg, p = 0.004). At T1, the heart rate in group D was significantly lower than in group C (80.89 ± 14.04 v 95.54 ± 12.53 bpm, p=0.022). The tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and cystatin C levels in group D were lower than those in group C after the surgery (T4) and 24 hours after surgery (T5), with statistical significance. The duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive-care-unit stay time, and hospital stay time in group D were significantly shorter than in group C. The incidences of tachycardia, hypertension, nausea, and vomiting in group D were similar to those in group C.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dexmedetomidine may be considered as a way to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass."

The experimental group (30 cases) was treated with routine treatment and continuous renal replacement therapy CRRT. The changes in inflammation and biochemical indexes and APACHE- II score were evaluated before the treatment and 1, 3, and 7days after the treatment. The inflammatory markers (neutrophil percentage, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels) in the experimental group decreased significantly after treatment. In the control group, the index of inflammation still increased one day after treatment and decreased on day 3 of treatment. After treatment, blood lactate, serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels decreased, but the urine volume increased. After treatment, the vasoactive dose in the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P less than 0.05).

      Despite the increasing use of pre- and post-hydration protocols and low osmolar instead of high osmolar iodine containing contrast media, the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is still significant. There is evidence that contrast media cause ischemia reperfusion injury of the renal medulla. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a non-invasive, safe, and low cost method to reduce ischemia reperfusion injury. The aim of this study is to investigate whether RIPC, as an adjunct to standard preventive measures, reduces contrast induced acute kidney injury in patients at risk of CIN.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The RIPCIN study is a multicenter, single blinded, randomized controlled trial in which 76 patients at risk of CIN received standard hydration combined with RIPC or hydration with sham preconditioning. RIPC was applied by four cycles of 5 min ischemia and 5 min reperfusion of the forearm. The primary outcome measure was the change in serum creatinine from baseline to 48 to 72 hours after contrast administration.
    


          Results:
        
      
      With regard to the primary endpoint, no significant effect of RIPC was found. CIN occurred in four patients (2 sham and 2 RIPC). A pre-defined subgroup analysis of patients with a Mehran risk score ≥11, showed a significantly reduced change in serum creatinine from baseline to 48 to 72 hours in patients allocated to the RIPC group (Δ creatinine -3.3 ± 9.8 μmol/L) compared with the sham group (Δ creatinine +17.8 ± 20.1 μmol/L).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      RIPC, as an adjunct to standard preventive measures, does not improve serum creatinine levels after contrast administration in patients at risk of CIN according to the Dutch guideline. However, the present data indicate that RIPC might have beneficial effects in patients at a high or very high risk of CIN (Mehran score ≥ 11).

Dexmedetomidine mitigates acute kidney injury after coronary artery bypass grafting: a prospective clinical trial.,"Congli Zhang, Yang Zhang, Di Liu, Mei Mei, Nannan Song, Qin Zhuang, Yiyao Jiang, Yuanyuan Guo, Gang Liu, Xiaohong Li, Li Ren, Congli Zhanget al.",2024 Aug,Rev Esp Cardiol (Engl Ed),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38423177/,No keywords found,"Introduction and objectives:
        
      
      To evaluate the impact of dexmedetomidine impact on cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI), kidney function, and metabolic and oxidative stress in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with heart-lung machine support.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A randomized double-masked trial with 238 participants (50-75 years) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting was conducted from January 2021 to December 2022. The participants were divided into Dex (n=119) and NS (n = 119) groups. Dex was administered at 0.5 mcg/kg over 10minutes, then 0.4 mcg/kg/h until the end of surgery; the NS group received equivalent saline. Blood and urine were sampled at various time points pre- and postsurgery. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of CSA-AKI, defined as the occurrence of AKI within 96hours after surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of CSA-AKI was significantly lower in the Dex group than in the NS group (18.26% vs 32.46%; P=.014). Substantial increases were found in estimated glomerular filtration rate value at T4-T6 (P<.05) and urine volume 24hours after surgery (P<.01). Marked decreases were found in serum creatinine level, blood glucose level at T1-T2 (P<.01), blood urea nitrogen level at T3-T6 (P<.01), free fatty acid level at T2-T3 (P<.01), and lactate level at T3-T4 (P<.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dex reduces CSA-AKI, potentially by regulating metabolic disorders and reducing oxidative stress. Registered with the Chinese Clinical Study Registry (No. ChiCTR2100051804)."
Preoperative serum ST2 level predicts acute kidney injury after adult cardiac surgery.,"Kevin W Lobdell, Devin M Parker, Donald S Likosky, Michael Rezaee, Moritz Wyler von Ballmoos, Shama S Alam, Sherry Owens, Heather Thiessen-Philbrook, Todd MacKenzie, Jeremiah R Brown, Kevin W Lobdellet al.",2018 Sep,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29759735/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between preoperative levels of serum soluble ST2 (ST2) and acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery. Previous research has shown that biomarkers facilitate the prediction of AKI and other complications after cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Preoperative ST2 proteins were measured in 1498 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery at 8 hospitals participating in the Northern New England Biomarker Study from 2004 to 2007. AKI severity was defined using the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) definition. Preoperative ST2 levels were measured using multiplex assays. Ordered logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between ST2 levels and levels of AKI severity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants in this study showed a significant association between elevated preoperative ST2 levels and acute kidney risk. Before adjustment, the odds of patients developing AKIN stage 2 or 3, compared with AKIN stage 1, are 2.43 times higher (95% confidence interval, 1.86-3.16; P < .001) for patients in the highest tercile of preoperative ST2. After adjustment, patients in the highest tercile of preoperative ST2 had significantly greater odds of developing AKIN stage 2 or 3 AKI (odds ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-2.65; P < .001) compared with patients with AKIN stage 1.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Preoperative ST2 levels are associated with postoperative AKI risk and can be used to identify patients at higher risk of developing AKI after cardiac surgery."
Early high-dose continuous veno-venous hemofiltration alleviates the alterations of CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets in septic patients combined with acute kidney injury.,"Beibei Jin, Da Cao, Ning Yang, Ling Wang, Ruifang Li, Xiumei Liu, Ping Gong, Beibei Jinet al.",2022 Jul,Artif Organs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35132659/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      This study aims to determine whether early high-dose continuous venous-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) alleviates the alterations in CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets in septic patients combined with acute kidney injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Enrolled septic patients combined with acute kidney injury were randomized into CVVH (n = 50) and conventional treatment (non-CVVH, n = 53) groups. Healthy volunteers (n = 21) were enrolled. CVVH was initiated within 12 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission with doses of 35~60 ml/kg/h and maintained for at least 72 h. Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg were measured by flow cytometry on days 1, 3, and 7 of ICU admission. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Th1 percentages and Th1/Th2 ratios were lower, and Th2, Th17, and Treg percentages and Th17/Treg ratios were higher in septic patients compared to healthy volunteers. CVVH significantly increased Th1 percentages and Th1/Th2 ratios, and significantly decreased Th2, Th17, and Treg percentages and Th17/Treg ratios compared to non-CVVH. Th1 percentages and Th1/Th2 ratios were negatively correlated with SOFA scores, while Th2, Th17, and Treg percentages and Th17/Treg ratios were positively correlated with SOFA scores. Patients with CVVH had significantly lower SOFA scores on day 7 of ICU admission and a shorter ICU stay compared to those with non-CVVH.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Septic patients combined with acute kidney injury exhibit different alterations of CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets. Early high-dose CVVH alleviates the alterations, which may be one of the factors associated with improved sepsis severity."
Prognostic significance of malnutrition risk in elderly patients with acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit.,"Na Wang#, Ping Wang#, Wen Li, Li Jiang, Meiping Wang, Bo Zhu, Xiuming Xi, Na Wanget al.",2022 Oct 18,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36258183/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Malnutrition is common in critically ill patients, but nutrition status in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) has been poorly studied. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between malnutrition risk and the occurrence and prognosis of AKI in elderly patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were extracted from the Beijing Acute Kidney Injury Trial (BAKIT). A total of 1873 elderly patients were included and compared according to the clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI groups, and those of survivors and non-survivors of AKI in this study. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse the predictive value of the modified Nutrition Risk in Critically Ill (mNUTRIC) score for the occurrence and 28-day prognosis of AKI. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of the mNUTRIC score on the 28-day mortality in AKI patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared with the non-AKI group, AKI patients had higher mNUTRIC scores, and non-survivors had higher mNUTRIC scores than survivors in AKI population. Moreover, multivariate Cox regression showed that 28-day mortality in AKI patients increased by 9.8% (95% CI, 1.018-1.184) for every point increase in the mNUTRIC score, and the mNUTRIC score had good predictive ability for the occurrence of AKI and 28-day mortality in AKI patients. The mortality of AKI patients with mNUTRIC > 4 was significantly increased.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The elderly patients are at high risk of malnutrition, which affects the occurrence and prognosis of AKI. Adequate attention should be given to the nutritional status of elderly patients.

      No randomized study has investigated the value of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in optimizing the results of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a multicenter, randomized study involving 240 patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes to compare OCT-guided PCI (use of OCT pre- and post-PCI; OCT-guided group) to fluoroscopy-guided PCI (angiography-guided group). The primary end point was the functional result of PCI assessed by the measure of post PCI fractional flow reserve. Secondary end points included procedural complications and type 4a periprocedural myocardial infarction. Safety was assessed by the rate of acute kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      OCT use led to a change in procedural strategy in 50% of the patients in the OCT-guided group. The primary end point was improved in the OCT-guided group, with a significantly higher fractional flow reserve value (0.94±0.04 versus 0.92±0.05, P=0.005) compared with the angiography-guided group. There was no significant difference in the rate of type 4a myocardial infarction (33% in the OCT-group versus 40% in the angiography-guided group, P=0.28). The rates of procedural complications (5.8%) and acute kidney injury (1.6%) were identical in each group despite longer procedure time and use of more contrast medium in the OCT-guided group. Post-PCI OCT revealed stent underexpansion in 42% of patients, stent malapposition in 32%, incomplete lesion coverage in 20%, and edge dissection in 37.5%. This led to the more frequent use of poststent overdilation in the OCT-guided group versus the angiography-guided group (43% versus 12.5%, P<0.0001) with lower residual stenosis (7.0±4.3% versus 8.7±6.3%, P=0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes, OCT-guided PCI is associated with higher postprocedure fractional flow reserve than PCI guided by angiography alone. OCT did not increase periprocedural complications, type 4a myocardial infarction, or acute kidney injury.

Dyschloremia Is a Risk Factor for the Development of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients.,"Min Shao, Guangxi Li, Kumar Sarvottam, Shengyu Wang, Charat Thongprayoon, Yue Dong, Ognjen Gajic, Kianoush Kashani, Min Shaoet al.",2016 Aug 4,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27490461/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Dyschloremia is common in critically ill patients, although its impact has not been well studied. We investigated the epidemiology of dyschloremia and its associations with the incidence of acute kidney injury and other intensive care unit outcomes.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study at Mayo Clinic Hospital-Rochester. All adult patients admitted to intensive care units from January 1st, 2006, through December 30th, 2012 were included. Patients with known acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease stage 5 before intensive care unit admission were excluded. We evaluated the association of dyschloremia with ICU outcomes, after adjustments for the effect of age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index and severity of illness score.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 6,025 patients were enrolled in the final analysis following the implementation of eligibility criteria. From the cohort, 1,970 patients (33%) developed acute kidney injury. Of the total patients enrolled, 4,174 had a baseline serum chloride. In this group, 1,530 (37%) had hypochloremia, and 257 (6%) were hyperchloremic. The incidence of acute kidney injury was higher in hypochloremic and hyperchloremic patients compared to those with a normal serum chloride level (43% vs.30% and 34% vs. 30%, respectively; P < .001). Baseline serum chloride was lower in the acute kidney injury group vs. the non-acute kidney injury group [100 mmol/L (96-104) vs. 102 mmol/L (98-105), P < .0001]. In a multivariable logistic regression model, baseline serum chloride of ≤94 mmol/L found to be independently associated with the risk of acute kidney injury (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6; P = .01).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Dyschloremia is common in critically ill patients, and severe hypochloremia is independently associated with an increased risk of development of acute kidney injury."
Predictive factors for severe long-term chronic kidney disease after acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients: an ancillary study of the ELVIS randomized controlled trial.,"Edouard Soum, Jean-François Timsit, Stephane Ruckly, Didier Gruson, Emmanuel Canet, Kada Klouche, Laurent Argaud, Maïté Garrouste-Orgeas, Christophe Mariat, François Vincent, Sophie Cayot, Michael Darmon, Julien Bohé, Carole Schwebel, Lila Bouadma, Claire Dupuis, Bertrand Souweine, Alexandre Lautrette, Edouard Soumet al.",2022 Nov 29,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36447221/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a serious complication in the ICU that results in increased mortality and risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Some studies suggest RRT modality may have an impact on long-term renal recovery after AKI. However, other predictive factors of severe long-term CKD in ICU patients with AKI requiring RRT are unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed an ancillary study of the multicenter ELVIS trial in the population with AKI requiring RRT. Patients alive 3 months after RRT initiation were eligible. Serum creatinine levels available at 3, 6 and 12 months and 3 and 5 years were recorded. CKD stage was determined according to the glomerular filtration rate as estimated by the CKD-EPI formula. At each timepoint, two groups of patients were compared, a no/mild CKD group with normal or mildly to moderately decreased renal function (stages 1, 2 and 3 of the international classification) and a severe CKD group (stages 4 and 5). Our objective was to identify predictive factors of severe long-term CKD.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 287 eligible patients, 183 had follow-up at 3 months, 136 (74.3%) from the no/mild CKD group and 47 (25.7%) from the severe CKD group, and 122 patients at 5 years comprising 96 (78.7%) from the no/mild CKD group and 26 (21.3%) from the severe CKD group. Multivariate analysis showed that a long RRT period was associated with severe CKD up to 12 months (ORM12 = 1.03 95% CI [1.02-1.05] per day) and that a high SOFA score at the initiation of RRT was not associated with severe CKD up to 5 years (ORM60 = 0.85 95% CI [0.77-0.93] per point).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Severe long-term CKD was found in 21% of ICU survivors who underwent RRT for AKI. The duration of the RRT in AKI patients was identified as a new predictive factor for severe long-term CKD. This finding should be taken into consideration in future studies on the prognosis of ICU patients with AKI requiring RRT. Trial registration ELVIS trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number: NCT00875069 (June 16, 2014), and this ancillary study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number: NCT03302624 (October 6, 2017)."
Early negative fluid balance is associated with lower mortality after cardiovascular surgery.,"Chenglong Li, Hong Wang, Nan Liu, Ming Jia, Haitao Zhang, Xiuming Xi, Xiaotong Hou                              ;, Beijing Acute Kidney Injury Trial (BAKIT) Workgroup, Chenglong Liet al.",2018 Nov,Perfusion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29871564/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Early fluid expansion could prevent postoperative organ hypoperfusion. However, excessive fluid resuscitation adversely influences multiple organ systems. This retrospective, observational study aimed to investigate the relationship between early negative fluid balance and postoperative mortality in critically ill adult patients following cardiovascular surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In total, 567 critically ill patients who had undergone cardiovascular surgery and whose intensive care unit length of stay (LOS) was more than 24 hours were enrolled. The baseline characteristics, daily fluid balance and cumulative fluid balance were obtained. Patients were followed until discharge or day 28. Multivariate logistic regressions adjusted by propensity score were used to analyze the relationship between early negative fluid balance and postoperative mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, postoperative mortality was 6.2% (35/567). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II on admission (odd ratios [OR] 1.110), acute kidney injury stage (OR 1.639) and renal replacement therapy received (OR 3.922) were the independent risk factors of postoperative mortality, whereas negative daily fluid balance at day 2 (OR 0.411) was the protective factor. Patients with a negative daily fluid balance at day 2 had lower postoperative mortality (3.4% vs. 12.2% in the positive fluid balance group), lower acute kidney injury (AKI) stage, were less likely to receive renal replacement therapy (RRT) and experienced shorter hospital LOS compared with those with a daily positive fluid balance.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This retrospective, observational study indicates that early negative fluid balance is associated with lower postoperative mortality in critically ill patients following cardiovascular surgery. Further prospective, randomized trials are needed to prove the benefits from the restrictive fluid management strategy."
Development of a MALDI MS-based platform for early detection of acute kidney injury.,"Emma Carrick, Jill Vanmassenhove, Griet Glorieux, Jochen Metzger, Mohammed Dakna, Martin Pejchinovski, Vera Jankowski, Bahareh Mansoorian, Holger Husi, William Mullen, Harald Mischak, Raymond Vanholder, Wim Van Biesen, Emma Carricket al.",2016 Jul,Proteomics Clin Appl,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27119821/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Septic acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with poor outcome. This can partly be attributed to delayed diagnosis and incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Our aim was to develop an early predictive test for AKI based on the analysis of urinary peptide biomarkers by MALDI-MS.
    


          Experimental design:
        
      
      Urine samples from 95 patients with sepsis were analyzed by MALDI-MS. Marker search and multimarker model establishment were performed using the peptide profiles from 17 patients with existing or within the next 5 days developing AKI and 17 with no change in renal function. Replicates of urine sample pools from the AKI and non-AKI patient groups and normal controls were also included to select the analytically most robust AKI markers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-nine urinary peptides were selected by cross-validated variable selection to generate a support vector machine multidimensional AKI classifier. Prognostic performance of the AKI classifier on an independent validation set including the remaining 61 patients of the study population (17 controls and 44 cases) was good with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.82 and a sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 76%, respectively.
    


          Conclusion and clinical relevance:
        
      
      A urinary peptide marker model detects onset of AKI with acceptable accuracy in septic patients. Such a platform can eventually be transferred to the clinic as fast MALDI-MS test format."

Role of modified hydration for preventing contrast-associated acute kidney injury in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction after primary percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Lei Liu, Li Zhou, Weiping Li, Hui Chen, Hongwei Li, Lei Liuet al.",2023 Jan,Intern Emerg Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36539602/,"Contrast-associated acute kidney injury, Hydration, Major adverse cardiovascular events, Percutaneous coronary intervention.","To assess the efficacy of modified hydration on contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). A total of 438 patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The traditional hydration group (group I) was given at a rate of 1 ml/kg/h for 24 h, and the modified hydration group (group II) was given at a rate of 3 ml/kg/h in the first 4 h, and then reduced to 1 ml/kg/h for 12 h. 0.3 mg/kg of furosemide was given 1-h after hydration. The primary endpoint was the incidence of CA-AKI, and the secondary endpoint was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) during a median of 22.4 months (IQR 9.6, 32.6 months) follow-up. The incidence of CA-AKI was 8.7%. Among these, Group I was 9.1% and group II was 8.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference in CA-AKI and creatinine levels between the two hydration groups. Multivariable logistics regression analysis revealed that creatinine, white blood cells, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were associated with CA-AKI. Moreover, CA-AKI was an independent predictor for all-cause death and cardiac death during the follow-up period. The modified hydration may reduce the incidence of CA-AKI, although this difference was not statistically significant. The relationship between CA-AKI and mortality strengthened as creatinine times above baseline increased. Mitigating the occurrence of CA-AKI may reduce all-cause death and cardiac death."

Patients underwent a battery of cognitive testing preoperatively and postoperatively and the incidence of delirium and acute kidney injury were measured. Norepinephrine (NEE) equivalents following induction were assessed for each group.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 49 patients were included, 25 in the ketamine group and 24 in the propofol group with 3 patients excluded from the analysis. No difference was found between groups in either postoperative cognitive dysfunction or delirium incidence. Acute kidney injury occurred in 6 (24%) patients in the ketamine group in 12 (50%) patients in the propofol group, but the difference did not meet statistical significance (P = 0.08; Relative Risk = 2.1, 95% CI 0.9-4.7). NEE equivalents were lower in the ketamine group, 9.6 ± 22.2 versus 32.7 ± 46.0, P < 0.03.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The use of ketamine versus propofol for induction of anesthesia did not impact the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction or delirium. Twice as many patients in the propofol group developed acute kidney injury, although not reaching statistical significance and warranting further investigation. In elderly, high-risk patients, ketamine was associated with a significantly reduced need for vasopressor support following induction."
Prospective randomized double-blind study to evaluate the superiority of Vasopressin versus Norepinephrine in the management of the patient at renal risk undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (NOVACC trial).,"Pierre-Grégoire Guinot, Olivier Desebbe, Guillaume Besch, Philippe Guerci, Philippe Gaudard, Diane Lena, Paul Michel Mertes, Osama Abou-Arab, Belaid Bouhemad                              ;, NOVACC study group, Maxime Nguyen, Bastien Durand, Audrey Martin, Vivien Berthoud, Tiberiu Constandache, Sandrine Grosjean, Mohamed Radhouani, Jean-Baptiste Anciaux, Pierre Voizeux, Anouck Appriou, Valentin Kabout, Jules Marcand, Florian Nays, Maxime Guilhot, Rudy Alardin, Dejan Ilic, Thomas Senot, Beyls Christophe, Bayart Guillaume, Lagarde Clément, Leviel Florent, Lefebvre Thomas, Haye Guillaume, Huguetto Aurore, David Helene, Grelet Tommy, Pereira Lucas, Zaepffel Zoé, Guilhot Maxime, Bataillard Amélie, Alardin Rudy, Senot Thomas, Jelicic Aleksandra, Ilic Dejan, Bronnert, Tissot Michel, Fouace Charles, Pierre-Grégoire Guinotet al.",2024 Jun:272:86-95.,Am Heart J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38492626/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CS-AKI) affects up to 30% of patients, increasing morbidity and healthcare costs. This condition results from complex factors like ischemia-reperfusion injury and renal hemodynamic changes, often exacerbated by surgical procedures. Norepinephrine, commonly used in cardiac surgeries, may heighten the risk of CS-AKI. In contrast, vasopressin, a noncatecholaminergic agent, shows potential in preserving renal function by favorably affecting renal hemodynamic. Preliminary findings, suggest vasopressin could reduce the incidence of CS-AKI compared to norepinephrine. Additionally, vasopressin is linked to a lower incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, another factor contributing to longer hospital stays and higher costs. This study hypothesizes that vasopressin could effectively reduce CS-AKI occurrence and severity by optimizing renal perfusion during cardiac surgeries.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      The NOVACC trial (NCT05568160) is a multicenter, randomized, double blinded superiority-controlled trial testing the superiority of vasopressin over norepinephrine in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The primary composite end point is the occurrence of acute kidney injury and death. The secondary end points are neurological, cardiologic, digestive, and vasopressor related complications at day 7, day 30, day 90, hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, medico-economic costs at day 90.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The NOVACC trial will assess the effectiveness of vasopressin in cardiac surgery with CPB in reducing acute kidney injury, mortality, and medical costs.

Urinary apolipoprotein M as a biomarker of acute kidney injury in children undergoing heart surgery.,"Eva Martha Madsen Svarrer, Henrik Ørbæk Andersen, Morten Helvind, Maartje C J Slagman, Gerjan Navis, Robin P F Dullaart, Björn Dahlbäck, Lars Bo Nielsen, Eva Martha Madsen Svarreret al.",2016,Biomark Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26642098/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      To investigate whether apoM is excreted in urine of children undergoing heart surgery and the potential of apoM as early biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Materials & methods:
        
      
      Urine was collected in children undergoing heart surgery. ApoM was measured with ELISA. U-apoM was characterized by gel filtration chromatography and western blotting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      ApoM was excreted into the urine 0-4 h postoperatively as the full-length apoM in particles smaller than plasma HDL. At 0 h, U-apoM predicted AKI with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.70 (p < 0.018). Sensitivity was 0.71 and specificity was 0.68 at a cutoff level at 1.45 nmol/l.

      ApoM is excreted in the urine of children after cardiac surgery. Its potential as biomarker of AKI deserves exploration."
Utility of Urine Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin for Worsening Renal Function during Hospitalization for Acute Heart Failure: Primary Findings of the Urine N-gal Acute Kidney Injury N-gal Evaluation of Symptomatic Heart Failure Study (AKINESIS).,"Patrick T Murray, Nicholas Wettersten, Dirk J van Veldhuisen, Christian Mueller, Gerasimos Filippatos, Richard Nowak, Christopher Hogan, Michael C Kontos, Chad M Cannon, Gerhard A Müeller, Robert Birkhahn, Yu Horiuchi, Paul Clopton, Pam Taub, Gary M Vilke, Olga Barnett, Kenneth McDonald, Niall Mahon, Julio NuÑez, Carlo Briguori, Claudio Passino, Alan Maisel, Patrick T Murrayet al.",2019 Aug,J Card Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31128242/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Worsening renal function (WRF) during acute heart failure (AHF) occurs frequently and has been associated with adverse outcomes, though this association has been questioned. WRF is now evaluated by function and injury. We evaluated whether urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) is superior to creatinine for prediction and prognosis of WRF in patients with AHF.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      We performed a multicenter, international, prospective cohort of patients with AHF requiring IV diuretics. The primary outcome was whether uNGAL predicted development of WRF, defined as a sustained increase in creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL or ≥50% above first value or initiation of renal replacement therapy, within the first 5 days. The main secondary outcome was a composite of in-hospital adverse events. We enrolled 927 patients (mean 68.5 years of age, 62% men). The primary outcome occurred in 72 patients (7.8%). The first, peak and the ratio of uNGAL to urine creatinine (area under curves (AUC) ≤ 0.613) did not have diagnostic utility over the first creatinine (AUC 0.662). There were 235 adverse events in 144 patients. uNGAL did not predict (AUCs ≤ 0.647) adverse clinical events better than creatinine (AUC 0.695).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      uNGAL was not superior to creatinine for predicting WRF or adverse in-hospital outcomes and cannot be recommended for WRF in AHF."
Effects of delayed remote ischemic preconditioning on peri-operative myocardial injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery - A randomized controlled trial.,"Tae Kyong Kim, Jeong Jin Min, Youn Joung Cho, Derek J Hausenloy, Hyuk Ahn, Kyung-Hwan Kim, Ho Young Hwang, Deok Man Hong, Yunseok Jeon, Tae Kyong Kimet al.",2017 Jan 15:227:511-515.,Int J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27839807/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has two time windows for organ protection: acute and delayed. Previous studies have mainly focused on the acute time window to evaluate organ protection by RIPC. We evaluated myocardial protection by delayed RIPC in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 160 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to receive either delayed RIPC (four cycles of 5min of ischemia followed by 5min of reperfusion by inflation to 200mmHg and deflation of a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm) or the control treatment 24-48h before surgery. The primary endpoint was post-operative troponin I levels serially measured for 72h. Secondary endpoints included post-operative serum creatinine levels, acute kidney injury, and composite complications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no significant differences in post-operative troponin I values. The incidence of acute kidney injury, defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network staging system, was lower in the delayed RIPC group compared to the control group (30.0% vs. 47.5%; relative risk, 0.768; 95% confidence interval, 0.599-0.985; p=0.023). Moreover, the occurrence of composite complications was lower in the delayed RIPC group compared with the control group (65.0% vs. 81.3%; relative risk, 0.536; 95% confidence interval, 0.311-0.924; p=0.020).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While RIPC did not provide cardioprotective effects in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, it appeared to reduce acute kidney injury, as well as the rate of composite complications."
Prolonged Blood Storage and Risk of Posttransfusion Acute Kidney Injury.,"Janet Adegboye, Suneeti Sapatnekar, Edward J Mascha, Karan Shah, Michael Lioudis, Hani Essber, Barak Cohen, Eva Rivas, Nancy M Heddle, John W Eikelboom, Martin H Ellis, Yehudit Sharon, Romi Sinha, Andrea Kurz, Daniel I Sessler, Janet Adegboyeet al.",2022 Jan 1,Anesthesiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34793586/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Erythrocyte transfusions are independently associated with acute kidney injury. Kidney injury may be consequent to the progressive hematologic changes that develop during storage. This study therefore tested the hypothesis that prolonged erythrocyte storage increases posttransfusion acute kidney injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Informing Fresh versus Old Red Cell Management (INFORM) trial randomized 31,497 patients to receive either the freshest or oldest available matching erythrocyte units and showed comparable mortality with both. This a priori substudy compared the incidence of posttransfusion acute kidney injury in the randomized groups. Acute kidney injury was defined by the creatinine component of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The 14,461 patients included in this substudy received 40,077 erythrocyte units. For patients who received more than one unit, the mean age of the blood units was used as the exposure. The median of the mean age of blood units transfused per patient was 11 days [interquartile range, 8, 15] in the freshest available blood group and 23 days [interquartile range, 17, 30] in the oldest available blood group. In the primary analysis, posttransfusion acute kidney injury was observed in 688 of 4,777 (14.4%) patients given the freshest available blood and 1,487 of 9,684 (15.4%) patients given the oldest available blood, with an estimated relative risk (95% CI) of 0.94 (0.86 to 1.02; P = 0.132). The secondary analysis treated blood age as a continuous variable (defined as duration of storage in days), with an estimated relative risk (95% CI) of 1.00 (0.96 to 1.04; P = 0.978) for a 10-day increase in the mean age of erythrocyte units.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In a population of patients without severely impaired baseline renal function receiving fewer than 10 erythrocyte units, duration of blood storage had no effect on the incidence of posttransfusion acute kidney injury."
"Lowering systolic blood pressure to less than 120 mm Hg versus less than 140 mm Hg in patients with high cardiovascular risk with and without diabetes or previous stroke: an open-label, blinded-outcome, randomised trial.","Jiamin Liu, Yan Li, Jinzhuo Ge, Xiaofang Yan, Haibo Zhang, Xin Zheng, Jiapeng Lu, Xi Li, Yan Gao, Lubi Lei, Jing Liu, Jing Li                              ;, ESPRIT Collaborative Group, Jiamin Liuet al.",2024 Jul 20,Lancet,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38945140/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Uncertainty exists about whether lowering systolic blood pressure to less than 120 mm Hg is superior to that of less than 140 mm Hg, particularly in patients with diabetes and patients with previous stroke.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this open-label, blinded-outcome, randomised controlled trial, participants with high cardiovascular risk were enrolled from 116 hospitals or communities in China. We used minimised randomisation to assign participants to intensive treatment targeting standard office systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg or standard treatment targeting less than 140 mm Hg. The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, revascularisation, hospitalisation for heart failure, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes, assessed by the intention-to-treat principle. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04030234.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Sept 17, 2019, and July 13, 2020, 11 255 participants (4359 with diabetes and 3022 with previous stroke) were assigned to intensive treatment (n=5624) or standard treatment (n=5631). Their mean age was 64·6 years (SD 7·1). The mean systolic blood pressure throughout the follow-up (except the first 3 months of titration) was 119·1 mm Hg (SD 11·1) in the intensive treatment group and 134·8 mm Hg (10·5) in the standard treatment group. During a median of 3·4 years of follow-up, the primary outcome event occurred in 547 (9·7%) participants in the intensive treatment group and 623 (11·1%) in the standard treatment group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·88, 95% CI 0·78-0·99; p=0·028). There was no heterogeneity of effects by diabetes status, duration of diabetes, or history of stroke. Serious adverse events of syncope occurred more frequently in the intensive treatment group (24 [0·4%] of 5624) than in standard treatment group (eight [0·1%] of 5631; HR 3·00, 95% CI 1·35-6·68). There was no significant between-group difference in the serious adverse events of hypotension, electrolyte abnormality, injurious fall, or acute kidney injury.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      For hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk, regardless of the status of diabetes or history of stroke, the treatment strategy of targeting systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with that of less than 140 mm Hg, prevents major vascular events, with minor excess risk.

In this post hoc analysis of a large placebo-controlled randomized trial of dexamethasone in 4465 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery, we examined severe AKI, defined as use of RRT, as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were doubling of serum creatinine level or AKI-RRT, as well as AKI-RRT or in-hospital mortality (RRT/death). The primary outcome occurred in ten patients (0.4%) in the dexamethasone group and in 23 patients (1.0%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.96). In stratified analyses, the strongest signal for potential benefit of dexamethasone was in patients with an eGFR<15 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). In conclusion, compared with placebo, intraoperative dexamethasone appeared to reduce the incidence of severe AKI after cardiac surgery in those with advanced CKD."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is a relatively common complication affecting short- and long-term survival. The renoprotective effect of vitamin D (VitD) has been confirmed in several experimental models. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of high-dose VitD administration in patients with VitD insufficiency on the incidence of postoperative AKI, the urinary level of tubular biomarkers, and serum anti-inflammatory biomarker after coronary artery bypass graft.
    


          Design and method:
        
      
      In this randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial, the patients were randomly allocated to either the VitD group (n = 50), receiving 150,000 IU VitD tablets daily for 3 consecutive days before surgery or the control group (n = 61), receiving placebo tablets.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative AKI between the groups. Both of the urinary levels of interleukin-18 and kidney injury molecule-1 were significantly increased after the operation (p < 0.001, for both). Also, the serum level of interleukin-10 was increased after 3 days of VitD supplementation (p = 0.001). In comparison with the control group, it remained on a higher level after the operation (p < 0.001) and the next day (p = 0.03). The patients with AKI had more postoperative bleeding and received more blood transfusion.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      VitD pretreatment was unable to impose any changes in the incidence of AKI and the urinary level of renal biomarkers. However, high-dose administration of VitD may improve the anti-inflammatory state before and after the operation. Further studies are needed to assess the renoprotective effect of VitD on coronary surgery patients."
Oral curcumin in elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: a multicentre randomized controlled trial.,"Amit X Garg, P J Devereaux, Andrew Hill, Manish Sood, Bharat Aggarwal, Luc Dubois, Swapnil Hiremath, Randolph Guzman, Vikram Iyer, Matthew James, Eric McArthur, Louise Moist, George Ouellet, Chirag R Parikh, Virginia Schumann, Sumit Sharan, Heather Thiessen-Philbrook, Sheldon Tobe, Ron Wald, Michael Walsh, Matthew Weir, Neesh Pannu                              ;, Curcumin AAA AKI Investigators, Amit X Garget al.",2018 Oct 29,CMAJ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30373740/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Curcumin, a popular herbal supplement from the plant turmeric, has prevented ischemic reperfusion and toxin-induced injury in many animal studies and a single-centre randomized human trial. We sought to test whether perioperative oral curcumin (compared with placebo) affects the inflammatory response and risk of postrepair complications after elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in humans.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of patients from 10 hospitals in Canada who were scheduled to undergo elective repair of an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (November 2011 to November 2014). Patients in the treatment group received perioperative oral curcumin (2000-mg doses 8 times over 4 d). Patients, health care providers and local research staff were unaware of the treatment assignment. The primary outcomes were median concentrations of 4 bio markers indicating injury and inflammation (postoperative urine interleukin-18 and perioperative rise in serum creatinine, plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups (606 patients overall; median age 76 yr). More than 85% of patients in each group took more than 80% of their scheduled capsules. Neither curcumin nor placebo significantly affected any of the 4 biomarkers (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Regarding the secondary outcomes, there was a higher risk of acute kidney injury with curcumin than with placebo (17% v. 10%, p = 0.01), but no between-group difference in the median length of hospital stay (5 v. 5 days, p > 0.9) or the risk of clinical events (9% v. 9%, p = 0.9).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Curcumin had no beneficial effects when used in elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. These findings emphasize the importance of testing turmeric and curcumin before espousing their health benefits, as is currently done in the popular media.

      Optimizing vancomycin dosing may help eradicate bacteria while avoiding resistance. The guidelines recommend loading doses; however, there are no data to demonstrate that this may result in a more rapid achievement of therapeutic troughs.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the percentage of troughs reaching therapeutic levels at 12, 24, and 36 hours following an initial vancomycin dose of 30 mg/kg compared with 15 mg/kg.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective, randomized study was performed in a community academic medical center. Patients who were to receive vancomycin in the emergency department were randomized to an initial traditional dose of 15 mg/kg or a 30-mg/kg loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3 doses. Patients weighing >120 kg or with creatinine clearances <50 mL/min were excluded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 99 patients were enrolled; 12 hours after the initial dose of vancomycin, there was a significantly greater proportion of patients reaching target trough levels of 15 mg/L among the patients who received a loading dose as compared with a traditional dose (34% vs 3%, P < 0.01). This trend continued at 24 hours but was not statistically significant. At 36 hours, there was no difference in the percentage of patients reaching target levels between the 2 groups. No statistically significant difference in nephrotoxicity or adverse events among the 2 groups was demonstrated.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A loading dose of 30 mg/kg of vancomycin achieved a higher percentage of therapeutic levels at 12 hours when compared with the traditional dose of 15 mg/kg, without increased nephrotoxicity or adverse events."

      This post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial was undertaken to establish the determinants of postoperative complications and acute kidney injury in high-risk noncardiac surgery patients supported with hemodynamic treatment strategies.
    


          Design:
        
      
      We conducted a post-hoc analysis of patients enrolled in the OPtimization Hemodynamic Individualized by the respiratory QUotiEnt (OPHIQUE) trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Operating rooms in four university medical centers and one non-university hospital from December 26, 2018, to September 9, 2021.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      We enrolled 350 patients with a high risk of postoperative complications undergoing high-risk noncardiac surgery lasting 2 h or longer under general anesthesia.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      All patients were treated according to hemodynamic treatment strategies which included cardiac output optimization by titration of fluid challenge and targeted systolic blood pressure to remain within ±10% of the reference value.
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      We assessed the association between pre-operative and intra-operative exposure of interest with a composite primary outcome of major complications or death within seven days following surgery using a multivariable logistic regression model. We also assessed the association between these exposures of interest and acute kidney injury.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      The data of 341 patients were analyzed. In multivariate analysis, the factors independently associated with the primary outcome were age (OR = 1.04 (1.01-1.06), P = 0.002), preoperative hemoglobin concentration (OR = 0.85 (0.75-0.96), P = 0.012), non-vascular surgery (OR = 0.30 (0.17-0.53), P < 0.0001), and intraoperative surgical complications (OR = 2.08 (1.02-4.24), P = 0.046). The factors independently associated with postoperative acute kidney injury were age (OR = 1.04 (1.01-1.08), P = 0.008), preoperative creatinine concentration (OR = 1.01 (1.00-1.01), P = 0.049), non-vascular surgery (OR = 0.36 (0.20-0.66), P = 0.001), and intraoperative surgical complications (OR = 3.36 (1.50-7.55), P = 0.031).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Surgical complications, a lower preoperative hemoglobin concentration, age, and vascular surgery were associated with postoperative complications in a high-risk noncardiac surgery population supported with hemodynamic treatment strategies."
Pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass and renal function in elderly patients undergoing aortic valve surgery†.,"Aldo Domenico Milano, Mikhail Dodonov, Willem Van Oeveren, Francesco Onorati, Y John Gu, Maddalena Tessari, Tiziano Menon, Leonardo Gottin, Giuseppe Faggian, Aldo Domenico Milanoet al.",2015 Feb,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24740935/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      To evaluate if pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has any protective influence on renal function in elderly patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Forty-six patients (≥ 75 years old) with aortic valve stenosis underwent AVR with either pulsatile perfusion (PP) or non-pulsatile perfusion (NP) during CPB. Haemodynamic efficacy of the blood pump during either type of perfusion was described in terms of the energy equivalent pressure and the surplus haemodynamic energy. Urine samples were collected before surgery, at sternum closure, and at 2 and 18 h of intensive care unit stay to detect acute kidney injury markers. Perioperative urine levels of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were assessed together with plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance (CCr) and 24-h haemodynamic monitoring. Normally distributed continuous variables were described as mean ± standard deviation and non-normally distributed data were presented as the median [25th-75th percentiles].
    


          Results:
        
      
      PP was characterized by a significantly higher amount of surplus haemodynamic energy transferred to the patients (P < 0.001), with lower mean systemic vascular resistance during CPB (P = 0.020) and during 18 h postoperatively (group-P = 0.018). No difference was found between pre- and postoperative CCr in the PP group (71 ± 23 vs 60 ± 35 ml/min, P = 0.27), while its statistically significant perioperative decrement was observed in the NP group (67 ± 24 vs 45 ± 15 ml/min, P < 0.001). The PP group showed significantly lower urinary levels of NAG at 18 h postoperatively (P = 0.008), and NGAL at sternum closure (P = 0.010), 2 h (P < 0.001) and 18 h (P = 0.015) postoperatively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Short-term PP in elderly patients showed higher safety for renal physiology than NP, resulting in better maintenance of glomerular filtration and lower renal tissue injury."
Angiopoietin/Tie2 Dysbalance Is Associated with Acute Kidney Injury after Cardiac Surgery Assisted by Cardiopulmonary Bypass.,"Rianne M Jongman, Jan van Klarenbosch, Grietje Molema, Jan G Zijlstra, Adrianus J de Vries, Matijs van Meurs, Rianne M Jongmanet al.",2015 Aug 26,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26309217/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      The pathophysiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is not completely understood. Recent evidence suggests a pivotal role for the endothelium in AKI. In experimental models of AKI, the endothelial specific receptor Tie2 with its ligands Angiopoietin (Ang) 1 and Ang2 are deranged. This study investigates their status after cardiac surgery, and a possible relation between angiopoietins and AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      From a cohort of 541 patients that underwent cardiac surgery, blood and urine was collected at 5 predefined time points. From this cohort we identified 21 patients who had at least 50% post-operative serum creatinine increase (AKI). We constructed a control group (n = 21) using propensity matching. Systemic levels of Ang1, Ang2, and sTie2 were measured in plasma and the AKI markers albumin, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) were measured in the urine.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ang2 plasma levels increased over time in AKI (from 4.2 to 11.6 ng/ml) and control patients (from 3.0 to 6.7 ng/ml). Ang2 levels increased 1.7-fold more in patients who developed AKI after cardiac surgery compared to matched control patients. Plasma levels of sTie2 decreased 1.6-fold and Ang1 decreased 3-fold over time in both groups, but were not different between AKI and controls (Ang1 P = 0.583 and sTie2 P = 0.679). Moreover, we found a positive correlation between plasma levels of Ang2 and urinary levels of NAG.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The endothelial Ang/Tie2 system is in dysbalance in patients that develop AKI after cardiac surgery compared to matched control patients."
Pentoxifylline for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in diabetic patients undergoing angioplasty: a randomized controlled trial.,"Naser Aslanabadi, Roghayeh Afsar Gharebagh, Saba Moharramzadeh, Taher Entezari-Maleki, Naser Aslanabadiet al.",2019 Apr,Int Urol Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30830654/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is one of the most important complications of contrast media. We aimed to evaluate the preventive effects of pentoxifylline (PTX) on CIN in diabetic patients undergoing angioplasty using cystatin C.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The present study was a randomized clinical trial, which was investigated the impact of PTX in the prevention of CIN among 90 diabetic patients undergoing the angioplasty using cystatin C as a novel biomarker of renal injury. The patients randomly were allocated 1:1 into the intervention and the control groups. The intervention group received a total of 1200 mg PTX orally before the angioplasty. The serum level of cystatin C and creatinine was measured at baseline and 24 h after the procedure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of CIN was 8.9% in the PTX group vs. 6.7% in the control group (p = 1.00). The baseline level of cystatin C was 1.31 ± 0.39 mg/L in the PTX group and 1.24 ± 0.42 mg/L in the control group (p = 0.561). After angioplasty, the level of cystatin C was increased to 1.33 ± 0.61 in PTX group and to 1.31 ± 0.47 in the control group but was not statistically significant. The similar pattern was also seen in the level of serum creatinine.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results of this study did not support the potential benefit of PTX in the prevention of CIN in diabetic patients undergoing angioplasty."
"A comprehensive description of kidney disease progression after acute kidney injury from a prospective, parallel-group cohort study.","Kerry L Horne, Daniela Viramontes-Hörner, Rebecca Packington, John Monaghan, Susan Shaw, Aleli Akani, Timothy Reilly, Thomas Trimble, Grazziela Figueredo, Nicholas M Selby, Kerry L Horneet al.",2023 Dec,Kidney Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37611867/,"acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, long-term outcomes, mortality.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with adverse long-term outcomes, but many studies are retrospective, focused on specific patient groups or lack adequate comparators. The ARID (AKI Risk in Derby) Study was a five-year prospective parallel-group cohort study to examine this. Hospitalized cohorts with and without exposure to AKI were matched 1:1 for age, baseline kidney function, and diabetes. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR) were measured at three-months, one-, three- and five-years. Outcomes included kidney disease progression, heart failure episodes and mortality. In 866 matched individuals, kidney disease progression at five years was found to be significantly increased in 30% of the exposed group versus 7% of those non-exposed (adjusted odds ratio 2.49 [95% confidence interval 1.43 to 4.36]). In the AKI group, this was largely characterized by incomplete recovery of kidney function by three months. Further episodes of AKI during follow-up were significantly more common in the exposed group (odds ratio 2.71 [1.94 to 3.77]) and had an additive effect on risk of kidney disease progression. Mortality and heart failure episodes were more frequent in the exposed group, but the association with AKI was no longer significant when models were adjusted for three-month eGFR and uACR. In a general hospitalized population, kidney disease progression after five years was common and strongly associated with AKI. Thus, the time course of changes and the attenuation of associations with adverse outcomes after adjustment for three-month eGFR and uACR suggest non-recovery of kidney function is an important assessment in post-AKI care and a potential future target for intervention.

Development and validation of a prediction model for the early occurrence of acute kidney injury in patients with acute pancreatitis.,"Simin Wu, Qin Zhou, Yang Cai, Xiangjie Duan, Simin Wuet al.",2023 Dec,Ren Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36999227/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute pancreatitis (AP) is associated with a high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). This study aimed to develop a nomogram for predicting the early onset of AKI in AP patients admitted to the intensive care unit.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Clinical data for 799 patients diagnosed with AP were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Eligible AP patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. The independent prognostic factors for the early development of AKI in AP patients were determined using the all-subsets regression method and multivariate logistic regression. A nomogram was constructed for predicting the early occurrence of AKI in AP patients. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seven independent prognostic factors were identified as predictive factors for early onset AKI in AP patients. The AUC of the nomogram in the training and validation cohorts were 0.795 (95% CI, 0.758-0.832) and 0.772 (95% CI, 0.711-0.832), respectively. The AUC of the nomogram was higher compared with that of the BISAP, Ranson, APACHE II scores. Further, the calibration curve revealed that the predicted outcome was in agreement with the actual observations. Finally, the DCA curves showed that the nomogram had a good clinical applicability value.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The constructed nomogram showed a good predictive ability for the early occurrence of AKI in AP patients."
A cost-effectiveness analysis of denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma in the United States of America.,"Noopur Raje, Garson David Roodman, Wolfgang Willenbacher, Kazuyuki Shimizu, Ramón García-Sanz, Evangelos Terpos, Lisa Kennedy, Lorenzo Sabatelli, Michele Intorcia, Guy Hechmati, Noopur Rajeet al.",2018 May,J Med Econ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29480139/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      A large, pivotal, phase 3 trial in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) demonstrated that denosumab, compared with zoledronic acid, was non-inferior for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs), extended the observed median progression-free survival (PFS) by 10.7 months, and showed significantly less renal toxicity. The cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid in MM in the US was assessed from societal and payer perspectives.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The XGEVA Global Economic Model was developed by integrating data from the phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy of denosumab with zoledronic acid for the prevention of SREs in MM. SRE rates were adjusted to reflect the real-world incidence. The model included utility decrements for SREs, administration, serious adverse events (SAEs), and disease progression. Drug, administration, SRE management, SAEs, and anti-MM treatment costs were based on data from published studies. For the societal perspective, the model additionally included SRE-related direct non-medical costs and indirect costs. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated using a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$150,000. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From a societal perspective, compared with zoledronic acid, the use of denosumab resulted in an incremental cost of US$26,329 and an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.2439, translating into a cost per QALY gained of US$107,939 and a NMB of US$10,259 in favor of denosumab. Results were sensitive to SRE rates and PFS parameters.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Costs were estimated from multiple sources, which varied by tumor type, patient population, country, and other parameters. PFS and overall survival were extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the primary analysis using fitted parametric curves.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Denosumab's efficacy in delaying or preventing SREs, potential to improve PFS, and lack of renal toxicity make it a cost-effective option for the prevention of SREs in MM compared with zoledronic acid."

          Patients:
        
      
      Acute ischemic stroke patients recruited within 3 hours or within 5 hours of symptom onset.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, endovascular treatment, IV albumin, or placebo.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Serum creatinine levels from baseline and within day 5 or discharge were used to classify acute kidney injury classification into stages. Any increase in serum creatinine was seen in 697 (36.1%) and acute kidney injury was seen in 68 (3.5%) of 1,931 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Severity of acute kidney injury was grade I, II, and III in 3.1%, 0.4%, and 0.05% patients, respectively. Patients with albumin (5.5% compared with 2.6%; p = 0.001), preexisting hypertension (4.3% compared with 1.5%; p = 0.0041), and preexisting renal disease (9.1% compared with 3.0%; p < 0.0001) had higher risk of acute kidney injury. The risk of acute kidney injury was lower between those who either underwent CT angiography (2.0% compared with 4.7%; p = 0.0017) or endovascular treatment (1.6% compared with 4.2%; p = 0.0071). In the multivariate analysis, hypertension (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.6) and renal disease (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.9-6.5) were associated with acute kidney injury. The risk of death was significantly higher among patients with acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-4.9) after adjusting for age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score strata.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The occurrence rate of acute kidney injury in acute ischemic stroke patients was low and was not higher in patients who underwent CT angiogram or those who received endovascular treatment. Occurrence of acute kidney injury increased the risk of death within 3 months among acute ischemic stroke patients."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among hospitalised patients and under-recognised by providers and yet carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Electronic alerts for AKI have become more common despite a lack of strong evidence of their benefits. We designed a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of AKI alerts. Our aim is to highlight several challenges faced in the design of this trial, which uses electronic screening, enrolment, randomisation, intervention and data collection.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      The design and implementation of an electronic alert system for AKI was a reiterative process involving several challenges and limitations set by the confines of the electronic medical record system. The trial will electronically identify and randomise 6030 adults with AKI at six hospitals over a 1.5-2 year period to usual care versus an electronic alert containing an AKI-specific order set. Our primary outcome will be a composite of AKI progression, inpatient dialysis and inpatient death within 14 days of randomisation. During a 1-month pilot in the medical intensive care unit of Yale New Haven Hospital, we have demonstrated feasibility of automating enrolment and data collection. Feedback from providers exposed to the alerts was used to continually improve alert clarity, user friendliness and alert specificity through refined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication following neonatal cardiac surgery and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to determine if plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels were associated with acute kidney injury and clinical outcomes in neonates with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.
    


          Design:

          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin peaked at 12 hours postcardiopulmonary bypass and more than doubled compared with preoperative levels. Higher preoperative and 24-hour postoperative neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels were associated with acute kidney injury (r = 0.30, r = 0.49), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (r = 0.40, r = 0.51), ICU (r = 0.32, r = 0.33) and hospital lengths of stay (r = 0.28, r = 0.32), and total hospital charges (r = 0.35, r = 0.30; all p values < 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Both preoperative and 24-hour postoperative plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels are associated with acute kidney injury and worse clinical outcomes in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery. Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels may have a role in risk stratification for predicting postoperative renal dysfunction as well as providing a potential clinical trajectory in the postoperative period."
Impact of a novel contrast reduction system on contrast savings in coronary angiography - The DyeVert randomised controlled trial.,"Steffen Desch, Georg Fuernau, Janine Pöss, Roza Meyer-Saraei, Mohammed Saad, Ingo Eitel, Holger Thiele, Suzanne de Waha, Steffen Deschet al.",2018 Apr 15:257:50-53.,Int J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29373136/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      The most prominent procedure-related and thus modifiable risk factor for contrast-induced acute kidney injury is contrast media (CM) volume. The DyeVert™ system has been designed to reduce the amount of CM. The primary objective of this randomised controlled trial was thus to examine whether the novel DyeVert™ contrast reduction system (Osprey Medical Inc., Minnetonka, MN, USA) leads to a reduction in CM volume in patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients scheduled for a diagnostic coronary angiogram were randomised to angiography with or without the DyeVert™ system. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean CM volume. Image quality was evaluated by an independent reviewer blinded to treatment allocation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 96 patients underwent randomisation. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. Use of the DyeVert™ system resulted in a significant 41.0% reduction in CM volume (36.9±10.9mL versus 62.5±12.7mL, p<0.001). Image quality using the DyeVert™ system was non-inferior compared to control (p=0.03). There were no device-related adverse events.

Current guidelines recommend that workers should consume sports drinks to maintain euhydration during work shifts. However, the impact of fructose sweetened sports drinks on acute kidney injury risk is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of sports drink consumption on markers of acute kidney injury following simulated industrial work in the heat. Twenty males completed two matched 2 h simulated industrial work trial visits in a warm and humid environment (30 °C and 55% relative humidity). During and following the bout of simulated work, participants consumed either a commercially available sports drink or a noncaloric placebo. Urine and blood samples, collected pre-, post-, and 16 h post-work were assayed for markers of hydration (plasma/urine osmolality, and urine specific gravity) and acute kidney injury (KIM-1 and NGAL). There were no differences in physiological or perceptual responses to the bout of work (interaction p > 0.05 for all indices), and markers of hydration were similar between trials (interaction p > 0.05 for all indices). KIM-1 (Placebo: Δ Ln 1.18 ± 1.64; Sports drink: Δ Ln 1.49 ± 1.10 pg/mL; groupwide d = 0.89, p < 0.001) and NGAL (Placebo: Δ Ln 0.44 ± 1.11; Sports drink: Δ Ln 0.67 ± 1.22 pg/mL; groupwide d = 0.39, p = 0.03) were elevated pre- to post-work, but there were no differences between trials (interaction p > 0.05). These data provide no evidence that consumption of fructose sweetened sports drinks increases the risk of acute kidney injury during physical work in the heat."
A Clinical Nomogram Based on the Triglyceride-Glucose Index to Predict Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury after Percutaneous Intervention in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome with Diabetes Mellitus.,"Yue Hu, Xiaotong Wang, Shengjue Xiao, Na Sun, Chunyan Huan, Huimin Wu, Minjia Guo, Tao Xu, Defeng Pan, Yue Huet al.",2022 Oct 27:2022:5443880.,Cardiovasc Ther,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36349299/,No keywords found,"The aim of the study was to investigate the factors influencing contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) after percutaneous intervention (PCI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with diabetes mellitus (DM). A total of 1073 patients with ACS combined with DM who underwent PCI at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University were included in this study. We divided the patients into the CI-AKI and non-CI-AKI groups according to whether CI-AKI occurred or not. The patients were then randomly assigned to the training and validation sets at a proportion of 7 : 3. Based on the results of the LASSO regression and multivariate analyses, we determined that the subtypes of ACS, age, multivessel coronary artery disease, hyperuricemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride-glucose index, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were independent predictors on CI-AKI after PCI in patients with ACS combined with DM. Using the above indicators to develop the nomogram, the AUC-ROC of the training and validation sets were calculated to be 0.811 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.766-0.844) and 0.773 (95% CI: 0.712-0.829), respectively, indicating high prediction efficiency. After verification by the Bootstrap internal verification, we found that the calibration curves showed good agreement between the nomogram predicted and observed values. And the DCA results showed that the nomogram had a high clinical application. In conclusion, we constructed and validated the nomogram to predict CI-AKI risk after PCI in patients with ACS and DM. The model can provide a scientific reference for predicting the occurrence of CI-AKI and improving the prognosis of patients."
Continued monitoring of acute kidney injury survivors might not be necessary in those regaining an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min at 1 year.,"Sokratis Stoumpos, Patrick B Mark, Emily P McQuarrie, Jamie P Traynor, Colin C Geddes, Sokratis Stoumposet al.",2017 Jan 1,Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28391314/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) among hospitalized patients often necessitates initiation of short-term dialysis. Little is known about the long-term outcome of those who recover to normal renal function. The aim of this study was to determine the long-term renal outcome of patients experiencing AKI requiring dialysis secondary to hypoperfusion injury and/or sepsis who recovered to apparently normal renal function.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All adult patients with AKI requiring dialysis in our centre between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 2010 were identified. We included patients who had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 12 months or later after the episode of AKI. Patients were followed up until 3 March 2015. The primary outcome was time to chronic kidney disease (CKD) (defined as eGFR persistently <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) from first dialysis for AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 2922 patients with a single episode of dialysis-requiring AKI, 396 patients met the study inclusion criteria. The mean age was 49.8 (standard deviation 16.5) years and median follow-up was 7.9 [interquartile range (IQR) 4.8-12.7] years. Thirty-five (8.8%) of the patients ultimately developed CKD after a median of 5.3 (IQR 2.8-8.0) years from first dialysis for AKI giving an incidence rate of 1 per 100 person-years. Increasing age, diabetes and vascular disease were associated with higher risk of progression to CKD [adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval): 1.06 (1.03, 1.09), 3.05 (1.41, 6.57) and 3.56 (1.80, 7.03), respectively].
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Recovery from AKI necessitating in-hospital dialysis was associated with a very low risk of progression to CKD. Most of the patients who progressed to CKD had concurrent medical conditions meriting monitoring of renal function. Therefore, it seems unlikely that regular follow-up of renal function is beneficial in patients who recover to eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 by 12 months after an episode of AKI."
Nephroprotective effects of remote ischemic preconditioning in coronary angiography.,"Naufal Shamilevich Zagidullin, Alina Rinatovna Dunayeva, Valdimir Vyacheslavovich Plechev, Alexander Zhanovich Gilmanov, Shamil Zarifovich Zagidullin, Fikret Er, Valentin Nikolaevich Pavlov, Naufal Shamilevich Zagidullinet al.",2017,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27814282/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a formidable side effect of iodinated contrast medium use in subjects undergoing coronary angiogram (CAG). Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) may reduce the risk of CIN.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to investigate the nephroprotective effects of RIPC in coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients, undergoing CAG, with mild to moderate lowered estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
    


          Materials:
        
      
      In the randomized, blinded, sham RIPC (sRIPC) controlled study 51 patients with CHD and GFR less than 80 mL/min/m2, undergoing CAG, were investigated. The patients were randomized for RIPC (n = 26, 60.5±2.0 years) or sRIPC (n = 25, 62.96±1.7). RIPC was performed before the CAG by means of 3-5-minute cycle cuff pumped on the upper arm + 50 mm Hg above the systolic blood pressure (BP), while in sRIPC it corresponded to diastolic BP. The primary endpoint was the development of CIN and secondary - change of biomarkers (creatinine, urea, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin-C).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In RIPC group, CIN occurred in 28% of cases, while in sRIPC - 3.8%. All investigated markers increased in sRIPC and declined in RIPC; the difference was significant in markers between the groups before and after CAG.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RIPC proved nephroprotective effect in prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in CHD subjects with mild to moderate lowered eGFR."
High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Concentration and Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery.,"Loren E Smith, Derek K Smith, Jeffrey D Blume, MacRae F Linton, Frederic T Billings th, Loren E Smithet al.",2017 Dec 9,J Am Heart Assoc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29223955/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is associated with increased short- and long-term mortality. Inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction and damage play important roles in the development of AKI. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and improve endothelial function and repair. Statins enhance HDL's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities. We hypothesized that a higher preoperative HDL cholesterol concentration is associated with decreased AKI after cardiac surgery and that perioperative statin exposure potentiates this association.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      We tested our hypothesis in 391 subjects from a randomized clinical trial of perioperative atorvastatin to reduce AKI after cardiac surgery. A 2-component latent variable mixture model was used to assess the association between preoperative HDL cholesterol concentration and postoperative change in serum creatinine, adjusted for known AKI risk factors and suspected confounders. Interaction terms were used to examine the effects of preoperative statin use, preoperative statin dose, and perioperative atorvastatin treatment on the association between preoperative HDL and AKI. A higher preoperative HDL cholesterol concentration was independently associated with a decreased postoperative serum creatinine change (P=0.02). The association between a high HDL concentration and an attenuated increase in serum creatinine was strongest in long-term statin-using patients (P=0.008) and was further enhanced with perioperative atorvastatin treatment (P=0.004) and increasing long-term statin dose (P=0.003).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A higher preoperative HDL cholesterol concentration was associated with decreased AKI after cardiac surgery. Preoperative and perioperative statin treatment enhanced this association, demonstrating that pharmacological potentiation is possible during the perioperative period.

Development and validation of a nomogram to predict the risk of renal replacement therapy among acute kidney injury patients in intensive care unit.,"Jiang-Chen Peng#, Yan Wu#, Shun-Peng Xing, Ming-Li Zhu, Yuan Gao, Wen Li, Jiang-Chen Penget al.",2023 Nov,Clin Exp Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37498349/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      There are no universally accepted indications to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) among patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). This study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the risk of RRT among AKI patients in intensive care unit (ICU).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted AKI patients from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (70%) and a validation cohort (30%). Multivariable logistic regression based on Akaike information criterion was used to establish the nomogram. The discrimination and calibration of the nomogram were evaluated by Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate clinical application.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 7413 critically ill patients with AKI were finally enrolled. 514 (6.9%) patients received RRT after ICU admission. 5194 (70%) patients were in the training cohort and 2219 (30%) patients were in the validation cohort. Nine variables, namely, age, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and lactate at AKI detection, comorbidity of congestive heart failure, AKI stage, and vasopressor use were included in the nomogram. The predictive model demonstrated satisfying discrimination and calibration with C-index of 0.938 (95% CI, 0.927-0.949; HL test, P = 0.430) in training set and 0.935 (95% CI, 0.919-0.951; HL test, P = 0.392) in validation set. DCA showed a positive net benefit of our nomogram.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The nomogram developed in this study was highly accurate for RRT prediction with potential application value."
Multiple myeloma can be accurately diagnosed in acute kidney injury patients using a rapid serum free light chain test.,"Jennifer L J Heaney, John P Campbell, Punit Yadav, Ann E Griffin, Meena Shemar, Jennifer H Pinney, Mark T Drayson, Jennifer L J Heaneyet al.",2017 Jul 20,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28728609/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Whether serum free light chain (sFLC) measurements can distinguish between myeloma and other causes of AKI requires confirmation to guide early treatment. A rapid and portable sFLC test (Seralite®) is newly available and could reduce delays in obtaining sFLC results and accelerate diagnosis in patients with unexplained AKI. This study evaluated the accuracy of Seralite® to identify MM as the cause of AKI.
    


          Method:
        
      
      sFLCs were retrospectively analysed in patients with AKI stage 3 as per KDIGO criteria (i.e. serum creatinine ≥354 μmol/L or those on dialysis treatment) (n = 99); 45/99 patients had a confirmed MM diagnosis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The Seralite® κ:λ FLC ratio accurately diagnosed all MM patients in the presence of AKI: a range of 0.14-2.02 returned 100% sensitivity and specificity for identifying all non-myeloma related AKI patients. The sFLC difference (dFLC) also demonstrated high sensitivity (91%) and specificity (100%): an optimal cut-off of 399 mg/L distinguished between myeloma and non-myeloma AKI patients. We propose a pathway of patient screening and stratification in unexplained AKI for use of Seralite® in clinical practice, with a κ:λ ratio range of 0.14-2.02 and dFLC 400 mg/L as decision points.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Seralite® accurately differentiates between AKI due to MM and AKI due to other causes in patients considered at risk of myeloma. This rapid test can sensitively screen for MM in patients with AKI and help inform early treatment intervention."
Predictive Capacity of Oxygen Delivery During Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Acute Kidney Injury.,"Richard F Newland, Robert A Baker, Richard J Woodman, Mary B Barnes, Timothy W Willcox                              ;, Australian and New Zealand Collaborative Perfusion Registry, Richard F Newlandet al.",2019 Dec,Ann Thorac Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31238029/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The randomized goal-directed perfusion trial confirmed retrospective findings that a goal-directed perfusion strategy to maintain oxygen delivery index (DO2i) during cardiopulmonary bypass greater than 280 mL/min/m2 reduces the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). We developed a predictive model for AKI using data from the Australian and New Zealand Collaborative Perfusion Registry to determine whether these findings could be validated in a real-world clinical setting and to identify an optimal DO2i threshold for predictive diagnostic accuracy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data in 19,410 cardiopulmonary bypass procedures were randomly divided into training (n = 9705) and validation (n = 9705) datasets. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the best predictive models for AKI (RIFLE [renal Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of renal function and End-stage renal disease] classification), incremental predictive value of minimum cardiopulmonary bypass DO2i, and optimal threshold.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Minimum DO2i was significantly associated with any AKI, AKI risk, and AKI injury or greater class in both datasets (validation dataset; any AKI odds ratio [OR], 0.993; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.991-0.995; P < .001; AKI risk OR, 0.994; 95% CI, 0.992-0.996; P < .001, AKI injury or greater 0.993; 95% CI, 0.991-0.996; P < .001), representing on average a 7% increase in the likelihood of AKI for every 10-mL/min/m2 decrease in DO2i. Diagnostic accuracy was similar for both datasets, with an optimal DO2i threshold of 270 mL/min/m2. The odds of any AKI were increased by 52% in those below the threshold (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.29-1.77; P < .001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study confirms previous findings that minimum DO2i during cardiopulmonary bypass is independently associated with AKI, supporting previous findings in a broader-risk, multicenter cohort."
The clinical utility of remote ischemic preconditioning in protecting against cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury: A pilot randomized clinical trial.,"Karolina Stokfisz, Anna Ledakowicz-Polak, Maciej Zagórski, Sławomir Jander, Katarzyna Przybylak, Marzenna Zielińska, Karolina Stokfiszet al.",2020 Feb,Adv Clin Exp Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32091672/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a well-known, serious complication and a well-recognized independent risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) in reducing the incidence of CSA-AKI, measured with the standard creatinine technique and using neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) serum concentrations as a potential new biomarker of kidney damage. The ethics committee of the Medical University of Lodz prospectively approved the protocol (approval No. RNN/286/13/KE). The study was retrospectively registered with the U.S. National Institutes of Health - NIH (29 June 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03205410).
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      We conducted a prospective single-center double-blind randomized and controlled tudy. Data was collected from patients admitted to the Cardiosurgery Clinic at the Medical University of Lodz (Poland) between January and December 2014, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery (an off-pump coronary artery bypass). A total of 28 patients were randomized to receive either RIPC (n = 14) or sham RIPC (n = 14). After the induction of anesthesia, the patients assigned to the RIPC group underwent 3 cycles of five-minute inflation to 200 mm Hg and five-minute deflation of the upper-arm cuff. The control group had a deflated cuff placed on the upper arm for 30 min. The authors measured the patients' serum creatinine concentration to check for the occurrence of a CSA-AKI within 48 h after cardiac surgery, and NGAL serum concentration to check its level within 3 h after the operation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fewer patients in RIPC group developed CSA-AKI within 48 h after cardiac surgery than in the control group (29% vs 93%; p = 0.003). Fewer patients in the RIPC group presented an increase in NGAL 3 h after surgery (medians: 124 vs 176.7; p = 0.0003).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients undergoing an off-pump coronary artery bypass, RIPC significantly reduces the occurrence of CSA-AKI and protects against increased postoperative NGAL levels."
Does lung ultrasound-guided ultrafiltration lead to better outcomes in acute kidney injury requiring intermittent hemodialysis: A randomized control trial.,"Vidhya K Zachariah, Vellathussery Chakkalakkoombil Sunitha, Natarajan Ramachandran, Balasubramanian Vairappan, Sreejith Parameswaran, Puthenpurackal Sivanpillai Priyamvada, Vidhya K Zachariahet al.",2024 Oct,Hemodial Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38965069/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Optimization of ultrafiltration during hemodialysis is a critical parameter in achieving therapeutic efficacy and ensuring hemodynamic stability. While various modalities such as blood volume monitoring, inferior vena cava diameter assessment, natriuretic peptide levels, bioimpedance assay, and lung ultrasound have been widely explored in the context of maintenance hemodialysis, the concept of volume-guided ultrafiltration in dialysis patients with acute kidney injury remains unexplored.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Adult patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, who were hemodynamically stable and not on ventilator support, without underlying lung pathology or cardiac failure, were randomized into two groups. All patients underwent 28-zone lung ultrasound before dialysis. The ultrafiltration was decided based on the treating physician's clinical judgment in controls. In the intervention group, the ultrafiltration orders prescribed by the treating physician were modified, based on the Kerley B line scores obtained by lung ultrasound. The rest of the dialysis prescriptions were similar. A postdialysis lung ultrasound was done in both groups to assess the postdialysis volume status 30 min after the dialysis session.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 74 patients undergoing hemodialysis for acute kidney injury were randomized. The baseline characteristics were comparable except for higher baseline B line score scores in the intervention arm. All patients received similar dialysis prescriptions. The lung ultrasound-guided ultrafiltration arm had a higher change in B line scores (BLS) from baseline (4 [0-9.5] vs. 0 [0-4]; p value 0.004) during the first dialysis session. The predialysis BLS indexed to ultrafiltration (mL/kbw/h) were significantly lower in controls, reflecting a relatively higher rate of ultrafiltration in controls compared with intervention (p = 0.006). The total number of dialysis sessions done in the control and intervention arm were 61 and 59, respectively. Among controls, 23/61 sessions (37.7%) had intradialytic adverse events, whereas, in the intervention arm, only 4/59 sessions (6.7) had any adverse intradialytic events (p < 0.01).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Lung ultrasound-guided ultrafiltration was associated with a better safety profile, as demonstrated by reduced intradialytic events."
A retrospective analysis of the effect of blood transfusion on cerebral oximetry entropy and acute kidney injury.,"Milo Engoren, Russell R Brown, Anna Dubovoy, Milo Engorenet al.",2017 Jan,Perfusion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27440803/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Acute anemia is associated with both cerebral dysfunction and acute kidney injury and is often treated with red blood cell transfusion. We sought to determine if blood transfusion changed the cerebral oximetry entropy, a measure of the complexity or irregularity of the oximetry values, and if this change was associated with subsequent acute kidney injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a retrospective, case-control study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at a tertiary care hospital, comparing those who received a red blood cell transfusion to those who did not. Acute kidney injury was defined as a perioperative increase in serum creatinine by ⩾26.4 μmol/L or by ⩾50% increase. Entropy was measured using approximate entropy, sample entropy, forbidden word entropy and basescale4 entropy in 500-point sets.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-four transfused patients were matched to 88 randomly selected non-transfused patients. All measures of entropy had small changes in the transfused group, but increased in the non-transfused group (p<0.05, for all comparisons). Thirty-five of 132 patients (27%) suffered acute kidney injury. Based on preoperative factors, patients who suffered kidney injury were similar to those who did not, including baseline cerebral oximetry levels. After analysis with hierarchical logistic regression, the change in basescale4 entropy (odds ratio = 1.609, 95% confidence interval = 1.057-2.450, p = 0.027) and the interaction between basescale entropy and transfusion were significantly associated with subsequent development of acute kidney injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The transfusion of red blood cells was associated with a smaller rise in entropy values compared to non-transfused patients, suggesting a change in the regulation of cerebral oxygenation, and these changes in cerebral oxygenation are also associated with acute kidney injury."
Goal-directed perfusion to reduce acute kidney injury: A randomized trial.,"Marco Ranucci, Ian Johnson, Timothy Willcox, Robert A Baker, Christa Boer, Andreas Baumann, George A Justison, Filip de Somer, Paul Exton, Seema Agarwal, Rachael Parke, Richard F Newland, Renard G Haumann, Dirk Buchwald, Nathaen Weitzel, Rajamiyer Venkateswaran, Federico Ambrogi, Valeria Pistuddi, Marco Ranucciet al.",2018 Nov,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29778331/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether a goal-directed perfusion (GDP) strategy aimed at maintaining oxygen delivery (DO2) at ≥280 mL·min-1·m-2 reduces the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This multicenter randomized trial enrolled a total of 350 patients undergoing cardiac surgery in 9 institutions. Patients were randomized to receive either GDP or conventional perfusion. A total of 326 patients completed the study and were analyzed. Patients in the treatment arm were treated with a GDP strategy during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) aimed to maintain DO2 at ≥280 mL·min-1·m-2. The perfusion strategy for patients in the control arm was factored on body surface area and temperature. The primary endpoint was the rate of AKI. Secondary endpoints were intensive care unit length of stay, major morbidity, red blood cell transfusions, and operative mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) stage 1 was reduced in patients treated with GDP (relative risk [RR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.83; P = .01). AKIN stage 2-3 did not differ between the 2 study arms (RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.46-6.0; P = .528). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes. In a prespecified analysis of patients with a CPB time between 1 and 3 hours, the differences in favor of the treatment arm were more pronounced, with an RR for AKI of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.27-0.89; P = .017).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A GDP strategy is effective in reducing AKIN stage 1 AKI. Further studies are needed to define perfusion interventions that may reduce more severe levels of renal injury (AKIN stage 2 or 3)."
Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin for the Early Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Patients Treated with Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,"Ilan Merdler, Keren-Lee Rozenfeld, David Zahler, Moshe Shtark, Ilana Goldiner, Itamar Shimon Loewenstein, Lior Fortis, Aviram Hochstadt, Gad Keren, Shmuel Banai, Yacov Shacham, Ilan Merdleret al.",2020,Cardiorenal Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32155621/,No keywords found,"Introduction and objective:
        
      
      Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a glycoprotein released by renal tubular cells, can be used as a marker of early tubular damage. We evaluated plasma NGAL level utilization for the identification of acute kidney injury (AKI) among ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary coronary intervention (PCI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      131 STEMI patients treated with PCI were prospectively included. Plasma NGAL levels were drawn prior to PCI (0 h) and 24 h afterwards. AKI was defined per KDIGO criteria of serum creatinine increase. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) methods were used to identify optimal sensitivity and specificity for the observed NGAL range.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall AKI incidence was 14%. NGAL levels were significantly higher for patients with AKI at both 0 h (164 ± 42 vs. 95 ± 30; p < 0.001) and 24 h (142 ± 41 vs. 93 ± 36; p < 0.001). Per ROC curve analysis, an optimal cutoff value of NGAL (>120 ng/mL) predicted AKI with 80% sensitivity and specificity (AUC 0.881, 95%, CI 0.801-0.961, p < 0.001). In a multivariate logistic regression model, NGAL levels were independently associated with AKI at 0 h (OR 1.044, 95% CI 1.013-1.076; p = 0.005) and 24 h (OR 1.018, 95% CI 1.001-1.036; p = 0.04).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Elevated NGAL levels, suggesting renal tubular damage, are independently associated with AKI in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI."
The effect of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on acute kidney injury after pediatric congenital heart surgery: A prospective randomized trial.,"Youn Yi Jo, Ji Young Kim, Ji Yeon Lee, Chang Hu Choi, Young Jin Chang, Hyun Jeong Kwak, Youn Yi Joet al.",2017 Jul,Medicine (Baltimore),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28700489/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Dexmedetomidine has been reported to have a renal protective effect after adult open heart surgery. The authors hypothesized that intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine would attenuate the decrease in renal function after pediatric open heart surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-nine pediatric patients (1-6 years) scheduled for atrial or ventricular septal defect repair were randomly assigned to receive either continuous infusion of normal saline (control group, n = 14) or dexmedetomidine (a bolus dose of 0.5 μg/kg and then an infusion of 0.5 μg/kg/h) (dexmedetomidine group, n = 15) from anesthesia induction to the end of cardiopulmonary bypass. Serum creatinine (Scr) was measured before surgery (T0), 10 minutes after anesthesia induction (T1), 5 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass weaning (T2), 2 hours after T2 (T3), and after postoperative day 1 (POD1) and postoperative day 2 (POD2) and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) were calculated. Renal biomarkers were measured at T1, T2, and T3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined as an absolute increase in Scr of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or a percent increase in Scr of ≥50%.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of AKI during the perioperative period was significantly higher in the control group than in the dexmedetomidine group (64% [9/14] vs 27% [4/15], P = .042). eGFR was significantly lower in the control group than in the dexmedetomidine group at T2 (72.6 ± 15.1 vs 83.9 ± 13.5, P = .044) and T3 (73.4 ± 15.4 vs 86.7 ± 15.9, P = .03).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine may reduce the incidence of AKI and suppress post-bypass eGFR decline."
Incidence and impact of acute kidney injury in patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with coronary artery bypass grafting: Insights from the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) and Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trials.,"Josephine Warren, Roxana Mehran, Usman Baber, Ke Xu, Daniele Giacoppo, Bernard J Gersh, Giulio Guagliumi, Bernhard Witzenbichler, E Magnus Ohman, Stuart J Pocock, Gregg W Stone, Josephine Warrenet al.",2016 Jan,Am Heart J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26699599/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-recognized predictor of morbidity and mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the impact of AKI on the outcome of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in relation to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has not been established.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Of the 17,421 patients who presented with non-ST-segment elevation ACS or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction enrolled in the ACUITY and HORIZONS-AMI trials, 1,406 (8.0%) underwent CABG as principal treatment after coronary angiography. End points were measured at 1 month and 1 year and included death, myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization. Acute kidney injury was defined as a rise in creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL, or > 25%, from baseline at initial angiography.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury occurred during hospital admission in 449 (31.9%) of the 1,406 patients treated with CABG. One-month and 1-year mortality was 6.7% vs 2.2% (P < .0001) and 10.4% vs 4.3% (P < .0001) for patients with vs without AKI, respectively. Analogously, the 1-month and 1-year incidence of composite major adverse cardiac events (MACEs; death, MI, or target vessel revascularization) was 17.6% vs 12.4% (P = .003) and 22.0% vs 15.3% (P = .002) for patients with vs without AKI, respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, race, diabetes, hypertension, and baseline creatinine clearance, AKI was an independent predictor of mortality (overall and cardiac-related) and MACE at both 1 month and 1 year in patients treated with CABG.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury occurred in approximately 1 of every 3 patients with ACS treated with CABG and is a powerful independent predictor of death and MACE. These data highlight the need for AKI prevention strategies in patients undergoing CABG."
Renal Function and Urinary Biomarkers in Cardiac Bypass Surgery: A Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Three Surgical Techniques.,"Stefanie Deininger, Markus Hoenicka, Kristina Müller-Eising, Patricia Rupp, Andreas Liebold, Wolfgang Koenig, Hagen Gorki, Stefanie Deiningeret al.",2016 Oct,Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26636393/,No keywords found,"Background Cardiopulmonary bypass procedure is associated with an increased risk of renal impairment. To which extent structural damage causes functional decline is unknown. We evaluated perioperative kidney injury and function in patients treated with conventional extracorporeal circulation (CECC), minimized extracorporeal circulation (MECC), and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). Methods Blood and urine samples, collected at baseline and up to 72 hours after surgery from patients of the HEPCON trial (DRKS00007580, 120 patients randomized for heparin management and for surgical technique), were analyzed for differences in renal injury and function. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, α glutathione S-transferase, liver fatty acid-binding protein, and kidney injury molecule-1 were measured as urinary protein markers of renal tubular injury. Serum creatinine, blood urea levels, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were determined to monitor renal function. Results Markers of tubular injury differed significantly between surgical technique groups early after surgery, indicating the most detrimental effect in CECC. Hemolysis and hemodilution correlated with these early changes. A late rise did not show intergroup differences. Time courses of renal function parameters, as well as the development of acute kidney injury in 15 patients (13.5%), were irrespective of surgical technique. Heparin management did not influence renal parameters. Conclusion During coronary artery bypass grafting, CECC temporarily induces more tubular injury than MECC or OPCAB. However, late changes of renal function parameters occur irrespective of extracorporeal perfusion mode and even in off-pump surgery."
Fluid balance-adjusted creatinine at initiation of continuous venovenous hemofiltration and mortality.

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is associated with high mortality. The creatinine-based stage of AKI is considered when deciding to start or delay RRT. However, creatinine is not only determined by renal function (excretion), but also by dilution (fluid balance) and creatinine generation (muscle mass). The aim of this study was to explore whether fluid balance-adjusted creatinine at initiation of RRT is related to 28-day mortality independent of other markers of AKI, surrogates of muscle mass and severity of disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a post-hoc analysis on data from the multicentre CASH trial comparing citrate to heparin anticoagulation during continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). To determine whether fluid balance-adjusted creatinine was associated with 28-day mortality, we performed a logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounders of creatinine generation (age, gender, body weight), other markers of AKI (creatinine, urine output) and severity of disease.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 139 patients, 32 patients were excluded. Of the 107 included patients, 36 died at 28 days (34%). Non-survivors were older, had higher APACHE II and inclusion SOFA scores, lower pH and bicarbonate, lower creatinine and fluid balance-adjusted creatinine at CVVH initiation. In multivariate analysis lower fluid balance-adjusted creatinine (OR 0.996, 95% CI 0.993-0.999, p = 0.019), but not unadjusted creatinine, remained associated with 28-day mortality together with bicarbonate (OR 0.869, 95% CI 0.769-0.982, P = 0.024), while the APACHE II score non-significantly contributed to the model.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this post-hoc analysis of a multicentre trial, low fluid balance-adjusted creatinine at CVVH initiation was associated with 28-day mortality, independent of other markers of AKI, organ failure, and surrogates of muscle mass, while unadjusted creatinine was not. More tools are needed for better understanding of the complex determinants of ""AKI classification"", ""CVVH initiation"" and their relation with mortality, fluid balance is only one."
Validation of a Contemporary Acute Kidney Injury Risk Score in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome.,"Antonio Landi, Mauro Chiarito, Mattia Branca, Enrico Frigoli, Andrea Gagnor, Paolo Calabrò, Carlo Briguori, Giuseppe Andò, Alessandra Repetto, Ugo Limbruno, Paolo Sganzerla, Alessandro Lupi, Bernardo Cortese, Arturo Ausiello, Salvatore Ierna, Giovanni Esposito, Giuseppe Ferrante, Andrea Santarelli, Gennaro Sardella, Ferdinando Varbella, Dik Heg, Roxana Mehran, Marco Valgimigli, Antonio Landiet al.",2023 Aug 14,JACC Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37587595/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      A simple, contemporary risk score for the prediction of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was recently updated, although its external validation is lacking.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to validate the updated CA-AKI risk score in a large cohort of acute coronary syndrome patients from the MATRIX (Minimizing Adverse Haemorrhagic Events by Transradial Access Site and Systemic Implementation of angioX) trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The risk score identifies 4 risk categories for CA-AKI. The primary endpoint was to appraise the receiver-operating characteristics of an 8-component and a 12-component CA-AKI model. Independent predictors of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes-based acute kidney injury and the impact of CA-AKI on 1-year mortality and bleeding were also investigated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The MATRIX trial included 8,201 patients with complete creatinine values and no end-stage renal disease. CA-AKI occurred in 5.5% of the patients, with a stepwise increase of CA-AKI rates from the lowest to the highest of the 4 risk categories. The receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.64-0.70) with model 1 and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68-0.74) with model 2. CA-AKI risk was systematically overestimated with both models (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test: P < 0.05). The 1-year risks of all-cause mortality and bleeding were higher in CA-AKI patients (HR: 7.03 [95% CI: 5.47-9.05] and HR: 3.20 [95% CI: 2.56-3.99]; respectively). There was a gradual risk increase for mortality and bleeding as a function of the CA-AKI risk category for both models.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The updated CA-AKI risk score identifies patients at incremental risks of acute kidney injury, bleeding, and mortality. (Minimizing Adverse Haemorrhagic Events by Transradial Access Site and Systemic Implementation of angioX [MATRIX]; NCT01433627)."

      Septic shock is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), and fluid resuscitation is a major part of therapy.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To determine if structured resuscitation designed to alter fluid, blood, and vasopressor use affects the development or severity of AKI or outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ancillary study to the ProCESS (Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock) trial of alternative resuscitation strategies (two protocols vs. usual care) for septic shock.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      We studied 1,243 patients and classified AKI using serum creatinine and urine output. We determined recovery status at hospital discharge, examined rates of renal replacement therapy and fluid overload, and measured biomarkers of kidney damage. Among patients without evidence of AKI at enrollment, 37.6% of protocolized care and 38.1% of usual care patients developed kidney injury (P = 0.90). AKI duration (P = 0.59) and rates of renal replacement therapy did not differ between study arms (6.9% for protocolized care and 4.3% for usual care; P = 0.08). Fluid overload occurred in 8.3% of protocolized care and 6.3% of usual care patients (P = 0.26). Among patients with severe AKI, complete and partial recovery was 50.7 and 13.2% for protocolized patients and 49.1 and 13.4% for usual care patients (P = 0.93). Sixty-day hospital mortality was 6.2% for patients without AKI, 16.8% for those with stage 1, and 27.7% for stages 2 to 3.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with septic shock, AKI is common and associated with adverse outcomes, but it is not influenced by protocolized resuscitation compared with usual care."
Impact of contrast-enhanced versus non-contrast computed tomography on acute kidney injury in acute necrotizing pancreatitis: A randomized controlled trial.,"Manoj M, Manavjit Singh Sandhu, Pankaj Gupta, Jayanta Samanta, Vishal Sharma, Vivek Kumar, Harshal Mandavdhare, Usha Dutta, Rakesh Kochhar, Manoj Met al.",2023 Dec,Indian J Gastroenterol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37578599/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The data evaluating contrast-induced-acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute pancreatitis is scarce. This study aimed to compare the frequency of AKI in patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis undergoing non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) with those undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) during hospitalization.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective randomized controlled trial (CTRI/2019/12/022206) screened consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis for eligibility and randomly allocated patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis (based on CECT in the first week of illness) and normal renal functions to receive either NCCT or CECT during hospitalization. The incidence of development of new AKI and clinical outcomes was compared between the two groups. Post-hoc analysis was done to adjust for disease severity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      As many as 105 patients completed the study as per protocol (NCCT = 45 and CECT = 60). AKI occurred in 36 (34.3%) patients, nine (20%) in the NCCT and 27 (45%) in the CECT group. Contrast induced-AKI occurred in 11 (18.3%) patients, while 25 had AKI secondary to acute pancreatitis. The relative risk (RR) of AKI in the CECT group was 2.25 (95% CI 1.17-4.30, p = .0142). The frequency of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.34-3.27, p = .0001) and need for drainage of collections (RR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.1-1.7, p = .005) was significantly higher and the length of hospitalization (p = .001) and ICU admission (p = 0.001) were significantly longer in the CECT group. However, when adjusted for the severity of acute pancreatitis, there was no difference in AKI and clinical outcomes between the NCCT and CECT groups. The duration of AKI was significantly longer and the need for dialysis was significantly higher in patients who had AKI secondary to acute pancreatitis compared to those with contrast induced-AKI (p = .003).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      CECT is not significantly associated with AKI in acute necrotizing pancreatitis."
Renal Safety and Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors in Patients With Contrast Media Exposure: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study.,"Yaowang Lin, Shaohong Dong, Yuanhui Liu, Yongshun Wang, Xin Sun, Jie Yuan, Danqing Yu, Huadong Liu, Yaowang Linet al.",2022 Nov 1,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35881908/,No keywords found,"There is no clear consensus on the safety of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with contrast media exposure. We aimed to assess the safety of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients exposed to contrast media at 1-year follow-up. Patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) were recruited and randomly divided into 2 groups (1:1 ratio): with ACEI/ARB group (ACEI/ARB continued throughout the study period) and without ACEI/ARB group (ACEI/ARB stopped 24 hours before and continued 48 hours after the procedure). The primary endpoint was contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) and secondary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and the need for renal replacement therapy during hospitalization and at 1-year follow-up. The occurrence rates of CI-AKI were not comparable in the ACEI/ARB group and the without ACEI/ARB group (2.92% and 2.62%, respectively; P = 0.866). No significant between-group differences were found with respect to the frequency of MACEs or renal replacement therapy during hospitalization and at 1-year follow-up. On subgroup analysis, among patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 45 mL/min, the incidence of CI-AKI was significantly higher in the ACEI/ARB group [17.95% (14/78) vs. 6.02% (5/83), P = 0.029]. Among patients with eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min, the incidence of CI-AKI was comparable in the 2 groups [0.87% (5/572) vs. 2.12% (12/567), P = 0.094]. The incidence of MACEs and renal replacement therapy was not comparable in the 2 groups, during hospitalization and at 1-year follow-up. ACEI or ARB treatment can safely be continued after exposure to contrast media, but not in patients with eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min."

Several studies have used predilution hemodiafiltration (HDF) in critically ill AKI patients with mixed results. In this study, we compared intermittent online postdilution HDF with the standard high-flux (HF) intermittent HD in non-critically ill patients with community-acquired (CA) AKI. In this pilot study, stable patients with CA AKI and systemic inflammatory response syndrome were included and given either postdilution online-HDF (OL-HDF) or standard HF HD outside intensive care units. The primary objectives were to assess the feasibility of conducting the study at a larger scale and to detect the differential impact of convective clearance on the rates of independence from dialysis at discharge or after 30 days. Plasma cytokine clearance was assessed as a secondary objective. Eighty consecutive AKI patients were randomized to receive dialysis in one of the treatment arms after fulfilling the eligibility criteria. The baseline parameters of clinical severity, etiology, and indications of dialysis, plus the baseline plasma cytokine profiles, were comparable. Moreover, 83% in the control arm and 71.1% in the intervention arm became independent from dialysis at discharge or at 30 days (P = 0.189). No survival advantage of postdilution OL-HDF was observed (P >0.05). Similar plasma cytokine clearance levels were noted in both arms. The current study confirms the feasibility; however, it does not support the preferential use of postdilution OL-HDF over HF-HD in non-critical patients."

A model for predicting postoperative persistent acute kidney injury (AKI) in AKI after cardiac surgery patients with normal baseline renal function.,"Yuanhan Chen, Zhiming Mo, Hong Chu, Penghua Hu, Wei Fan, Yanhua Wu, Li Song, Li Zhang, Zhilian Li, Shuangxin Liu, Zhiming Ye, Xinling Liang, Yuanhan Chenet al.",2024 Jan,Clin Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37805965/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Persistent acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is not uncommon and linked to poor outcomes.
    


          Hypothesis:
        
      
      The purpose was to develop a model for predicting postoperative persistent AKI in patients with normal baseline renal function who experienced AKI after cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from 5368 patients with normal renal function at baseline who experienced AKI after cardiopulmonary bypass cardiac surgery in our hospital were retrospectively evaluated. Among them, 3768 patients were randomly assigned to develop the model, while the remaining patients were used to validate the model. The new model was developed using logistic regression with variables selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of persistent AKI was 50.6% in the development group. Nine variables were selected for the model, including age, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cardiopulmonary bypass time, AKI stage at initial diagnosis after cardiac surgery, postoperative serum magnesium level of <0.8 mmol/L, postoperative duration of mechanical ventilation, and postoperative intra-aortic balloon pump use. The model's performance was good in the validation group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.761 (95% confidence interval: 0.737-0.784). Observations and predictions from the model agreed well in the calibration plot. The model was also clinically useful based on decision curve analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It is feasible by using the model to identify persistent AKI after cardiac surgery in patients with normal baseline renal function who experienced postoperative AKI, which may aid in patient stratification and individualized precision treatment strategy."
Preservation of kidney function in kidney transplant recipients by alkali therapy (Preserve-Transplant Study): rationale and study protocol.,"Anna Wiegand, Alexander Ritter, Nicole Graf, Spyridon Arampatzis, Daniel Sidler, Karine Hadaya, Thomas F Müller, Carsten A Wagner, Rudolf P Wüthrich, Nilufar Mohebbi, Anna Wiegandet al.",2018 Jul 13,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30001705/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Graft survival after kidney transplantation has significantly improved within the last decades but there is a substantial number of patients with declining transplant function and graft loss. Over the past years several studies have shown that metabolic acidosis plays an important role in the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and that alkalinizing therapies significantly delayed progression of CKD. Importantly, metabolic acidosis is highly prevalent in renal transplant patients and a recent retrospective study has shown that metabolic acidosis is associated with increased risk of graft loss and patient death in kidney transplant recipients. However, no prospective trial has been initiated yet to test the role of alkali treatment on renal allograft function.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Preserve-Transplant Study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, patient-blinded, multi-center, randomized, controlled phase-IV trial with two parallel-groups comparing sodium bicarbonate to placebo. The primary objective is to test if alkali treatment will preserve kidney graft function and diminish the progression of CKD in renal transplant patients by assesing the change in eGFR over 2 years from baseline. Additionally we want to investigate the underlying pathomechanisms of nephrotoxicity of metabolic acidosis.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This study has the potential to provide evidence that alkali treatment may slow or reduce the progression towards graft failure and significantly decrease the rate of end stage renal disease (ESRD), thus prolonging long-term graft survival. The implementation of alkali therapy into the drug regimen of kidney transplant recipients would have a favorable risk-benefit ratio since alkali supplements are routinely used in CKD patients and represent a well-tolerated, safe and cost-effective treatment.

      Contrast media (CM) volume minimization has been advocated for prevention of AKI. The DyeVert CM diversion system (Osprey Medical, Inc) is designed to reduce CM volume during coronary procedures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomized, single-blind, investigator-driven clinical trial conducted in 4 Italian centers from February 4, 2020 to September 13, 2022, 550 participants with ACS were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the following: 1) the contrast volume reduction (CVR) group (n = 276), in which CM injection was handled by the CM diversion system; and 2) the control group (n = 274), in which a conventional manual or automatic injection syringe was used. The primary endpoint was the rate of AKI, defined as a serum creatinine (sCr) increase ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours after CM exposure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 412 of 550 (74.5%) participants with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (211 of 276 [76.4%] in the CVR group and 201 of 274 [73.3%] in the control group). The CM volume was lower in the CVR group (95 ± 30 mL vs 160 ± 23 mL; P < 0.001). Seven participants (1 in the CVR group and 6 in the control group) did not have postprocedural sCr values. AKI occurred in 44 of 275 (16%) participants in the CVR group and in 65 of 268 (24.3%) participants in the control group (relative risk: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47-0.93; P = 0.018).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      CM volume reduction obtained using the CM diversion system is effective for prevention of AKI in patients with ACS undergoing invasive procedures. (REnal Insufficiency Following Contrast MEDIA Administration TriaL IV [REMEDIALIV]: NCT04714736)."

      Liberal oxygen (hyperoxia) is commonly administered to patients during surgery, and oxygenation is known to impact mechanisms of perioperative organ injury.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the effect of intraoperative hyperoxia compared to maintaining normoxia on oxidative stress, kidney injury, and other organ dysfunctions after cardiac surgery.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This was a participant- and assessor-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted from April 2016 to October 2020 with 1 year of follow-up at a single tertiary care medical center. Adult patients (>18 years) presenting for elective open cardiac surgery without preoperative oxygen requirement, acute coronary syndrome, carotid stenosis, or dialysis were included. Of 3919 patients assessed, 2501 were considered eligible and 213 provided consent. Of these, 12 were excluded prior to randomization and 1 following randomization whose surgery was cancelled, leaving 100 participants in each group.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants were randomly assigned to hyperoxia (1.00 fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2]) or normoxia (minimum FiO2 to maintain oxygen saturation 95%-97%) throughout surgery.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Participants were assessed for oxidative stress by measuring F2-isoprostanes and isofurans, for acute kidney injury (AKI), and for delirium, myocardial injury, atrial fibrillation, and additional secondary outcomes. Participants were monitored for 1 year following surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two hundred participants were studied (median [IQR] age, 66 [59-72] years; 140 male and 60 female; 82 [41.0%] with diabetes). F2-isoprostanes and isofurans (primary mechanistic end point) increased on average throughout surgery, from a median (IQR) of 73.3 (53.1-101.1) pg/mL at baseline to a peak of 85.5 (64.0-109.8) pg/mL at admission to the intensive care unit and were 9.2 pg/mL (95% CI, 1.0-17.4; P = .03) higher during surgery in patients assigned to hyperoxia. Median (IQR) change in serum creatinine (primary clinical end point) from baseline to postoperative day 2 was 0.01 mg/dL (-0.12 to 0.19) in participants assigned hyperoxia and -0.01 mg/dL (-0.16 to 0.19) in those assigned normoxia (median difference, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.10; P = .45). AKI occurred in 21 participants (21%) in each group. Intraoperative oxygen treatment did not affect additional acute organ injuries, safety events, or kidney, neuropsychological, and functional outcomes at 1 year.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among adults receiving cardiac surgery, intraoperative hyperoxia increased intraoperative oxidative stress compared to normoxia but did not affect kidney injury or additional measurements of organ injury including delirium, myocardial injury, and atrial fibrillation.

Does Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning Protect Kidney and Cardiomyocytes After Coronary Revascularization? A Double Blind Controlled Clinical Trial.,"Seyed Mahmoud Nouraei, Afshin Gholipour Baradari, Asieh Jazayeri, Seyed Mahmoud Nouraeiet al.",2016 Oct,Med Arch,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27994300/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning on reducing kidney injury and myocardial damage after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG).
    


          Background:
        
      
      Ischaemic preconditioning of a remote organ reduces ischaemia-reperfusion injury of kidney and myocardium after CABG.
    


          Method:
        
      
      To reduce myocardial damage and kidney injury by applying Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning we recruited 100 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. We applied three cycles of lower limb tourniquet, inflated its cuff for 5 minutes in study group or left un-inflated (sham or control group) before the procedure. The primary outcome was serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and troponin-I Levels at time 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Secondary outcomes were serum C-reactive protein, inotrope score, ventilation time and ICU stay. Data's were analyzed by MedCalc (MedCalc Software bvba, Acacialaan, Belgium). We compared the two group by student t test, chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The two groups were not statistically different in terms of age, gender, smoking habits, drug use, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus. This study showed a higher CRP level in study group comparing with control group (P=0.003), creatinine clearance was slightly higher in study group specially 24 h after procedure but was not statistically significant (p=0.11). Troponin-I level was significantly lower in study group (p=0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study showed a lower Troponin-I level in study group which suggest a cardio-myocyte protective function of RIPC. It also showed slightly lower Creatinine clearance in control group, gap between two group increases significantly 24 hours after procedure which may suggest a potential kidney protection by RIPC. Serum CRP level was higher in study group. A multi-center randomized controlled trial with a longer time for creatinine clearance measurement may show the potential effectiveness of this non-invasive inexpensive intervention on reducing kidney injury after CABG."
Is serum gentamicin concentration modified with autologous cell-saved blood transfusion after total knee arthroplasty using tranexamic acid? A randomised control trial.,"Panagiotis Touzopoulos, Konstantinos Arvanitidis, Eirini Filidou, Konstantinos Tilkeridis, Michael Karanikas, George Kolios, Athanasios Ververidis, Panagiotis Touzopouloset al.",2021 May,Orthop Traumatol Surg Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33333277/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Self-transfusion has been proven as an effective management of blood loss after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Considering that the high local concentration of antibiotic from bone cement is delivered intravenously through the self-transfusion process, systematic toxicity has never been evaluated. In addition, the effectiveness of self-transfusion with the routine concomitant use of other modern blood-salvage strategies, like tranexamic acid, should also be assessed. Therefore, we performed a randomised study to assess: 1) the safety of self-transfusion in TKA by comparing the gentamicin concentrations resulting from the use or not of autologous blood transfusion; 2) the efficacy of self-transfusion in TKA, with the concomitant administration of tranexamic acid.
    


          Hypothesis:
        
      
      Self-transfusion in TKA elevates the serum gentamicin concentration and the potential risk of nephrotoxicity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The serum concentration of aminoglycosides was measured in two groups of 20 patients each, after TKA, according to the use of self-transfusion. Hemoglobin, renal function and calculated blood loss were compared at several points in time between groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The only time where there was a statistically significant difference in serum gentamicin, was at 48h postoperatively between groups [0.3 ug/mL±0.21, range: 0.15 to 0.72 vs. 0.14ug/mL±0.1, range: 0 to 0.35 (p=0.02)]. There were no significant differences in total blood loss [1341mL±501, range: 830 to 2230 vs. 1263mL±459 range: 840 to 2480 (p=0.67)] and need of allogeneic blood transfusion [3 units vs. 2 units] between groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The use of autologous blood transfusion was found to be safe, in terms of nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides after TKA, but it seemed to be ineffective as a blood salvage strategy, when used concomitantly with the administration of tranexamic acid.

      To assess weather doctors' clinical risk-assessment for major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and acute kidney injury (AKI) after open-heart surgery would improve when being informed about neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) test result at ICU admission.
    


          Patients & methods:
        
      
      Clinical risk-assessment for MAKE and AKI were performed with and without providing NGAL test result and compared in an exploratory- and a validation-cohort using reclassification metrics, exemplary category-free net reclassification improvement (cfNRI).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Exploratory cohort: doctors' prediction of MAKE (cfNRI = 0.750 [0.130-1.370]; p = 0.018) and AKI (cfNRI = 0.565 [0.001-1.129]; p = 0.049) improved being provided with NGAL test information. This finding was confirmed in the validation-cohort (MAKE cfNRI = 0.930 [0.188-1.672]; p = 0.014) and the combined-cohort (MAKE: cfNRI = 0.847 [0.371-1.323], p < 0.001); AKI: cfNRI = 0.468 [0.099-0.836; p = 0.013]).

Impact of intraoperative fluid restriction on renal outcomes in patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.,"Chie Mori, Hajime Iwasaki, Izumi Sato, Kenichi Takahoko, Yosuke Inaba, Yohei Kawasaki, Gaku Tamaki, Hidehiro Kakizaki, Chie Moriet al.",2023 Oct,J Robot Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37101057/,"Acute kidney injury, Fluid restriction, Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.","Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) requires intraoperative fluid restriction to maintain the optimal view of the operative field during vesicourethral anastomosis and to prevent upper airway edema that may occur due to the steep Trendelenburg position. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that our fluid restriction regimen would not increase postoperative serum creatinine (sCr) levels in patients undergoing RALP. The fluid regimen involved maintaining a crystalloid infusion at 1 ml/kg/h until completion of vesicourethral anastomosis, then rapid infusion of 15 ml/kg within 30 min, followed by maintenance at 1.5 ml/kg/h until post-operative day (POD) 1. The primary outcome of this study was the change in the sCr level from baseline to POD7. Secondary outcomes were the sCr levels on PODs 1 and 2, the surgical view during vesicourethral anastomosis, and the incidences of re-intubation and acute kidney injury (AKI). Sixty-six patients were eligible for the analysis. The paired t test for non-inferiority showed no significant difference in sCr levels between baseline and POD7 (mean ± standard deviation, 0.79 ± 0.14 vs. 0.80 ± 0.18 mg/dl, p < 0.001). Seven patients developed AKI on POD1, but all but one recovered on POD2. Ninety-seven percent of operations were rated as having a good view of the operative field. There were no cases of re-intubation. This study demonstrated that the fluid restriction regimen of 1 ml/kg/h until completion of vesicourethral anastomosis created a good view of the operative field during vesicourethral anastomosis without increasing postoperative sCr levels in patients undergoing RALP.

      To evaluate the efficacy of forced diuresis with matched controlled hydration (FMH) in a real-world, high risk population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is an investigator-driven, single-center, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. A total of 150 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography, angioplasty or TAVR who were treated with FMH were compared to a matched historical control cohort.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the FMH treated patients, eGFR improved following the procedure from 37ml/min per 1.73m2 at baseline to 39ml/min per 1.73m2 (p<0.001); the net creatinine decreased from 1.85mg/dl to 1.78mg/dl (p<0.001). Among the matched control group, eGFR deteriorated from a baseline value of 36.7ml/min per 1.73m2 to 33.2ml/min per 1.73m2 post procedurally (p<0.001); the net creatinine increased from 1.88mg/dl to 2.14mg/dl (p<0.001). The incidence of post procedural AKI was substantially lower in the FMH treated group (2.7%) compared to the control group (26.7%). By multivariable analysis FMH treatment was independently correlated with reduced incidence of post procedural AKI compared with the control group (OR 0.06, p<0.001). Contrast volume did not correlate with AKI in neither univariate nor multivariate analyses.

Plasma Renin Concentration is Associated With Hemodynamic Deficiency and Adverse Renal Outcome in Septic Shock.,"Maxime Nguyen, Damien Denimal, Auguste Dargent, Pierre-Grégoire Guinot, Laurence Duvillard, Jean-Pierre Quenot, Bélaïd Bouhemad, Maxime Nguyenet al.",2019 Oct,Shock,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30407370/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      In septic shock, both systemic vasodilatation and glomerular arteriole dilatation are responsible for the drop in glomerular filtration observed in early acute kidney injury. Angiotensin II has been shown to act on both mechanisms. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of renin angiotensin system activation, on hemodynamic deficiency and renal outcome in patient with septic shock and to assess whether urinary sodium could be a reliable test for high plasma renin concentration screening.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a prospective and observational study. Inclusion criteria were early septic shock (first episode), dose of norepinephrine ≥ 0.25 μg/kg/min, before the start of substitutive corticosteroids. Plasma renin concentration, plasma aldosterone concentration, and urinary sodium were measured at inclusion. Renal outcome, organ deficiency, and 28-day survival were followed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Plasma renin concentration was associated with worse hemodynamic deficiency and adverse renal outcome. Natriuresis was associated with shock severity but was not associated with renal outcome. Low natriuresis (< 20 mM) was associated with higher renin concentration. Those two variables were only weakly correlated.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Plasma renin concentration is associated with adverse renal outcome, probably through shock severity and insufficient glomerular efferent arterioles vasoconstriction. An association was observed between low natriuresis and high plasma renin concentration."

A New Preprocedure Risk Score for Predicting Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury.,"Chongyang Duan, Yingshu Cao, Yong Liu, Lizhi Zhou, Kaike Ping, Ming T Tan, Ning Tan, Jiyan Chen, Pingyan Chen, Chongyang Duanet al.",2017 Jun,Can J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28392272/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Most of the risk models for predicting contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) are available for only postcontrast exposure prediction; however, prediction before the procedure is more valuable in practice. This study aimed to develop a risk scoring system based on preprocedural characteristics for early prediction of CI-AKI in patients after coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We prospectively recruited 1777 consecutive patients who were randomized in an approximate 3:2 ratio to create a development data set (n = 1076) and a validation data set (n = 701). A risk score model based on preprocedural risk factors was developed using stepwise logistic regression. Validation was performed by bootstrap and split-sample methods.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The occurrence of CI-AKI was 5.97% (106 of 1777), 5.95% (64 of 1076), and 5.99% (42 of 701) in the overall, developmental, and validation data sets, respectively. The risk score was developed with 5 prognostic factors (age, serum creatinine levels, N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and primary PCI), ranged from 0-36, and was well calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 = 4.162; P = 0.842). Good discrimination was obtained both in the developmental and validation data sets (C-statistic, 0.809 and 0.798, respectively). The risk score was highly and positively associated with CI-AKI (P for trend < 0.001) in-hospital and long-term outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The novel risk score model we developed is a simple and accurate tool for early/preprocedural prediction of CI-AKI in patients undergoing coronary angiography or PCI. This tool allows assessment of the risk of CI-AKI before contrast exposure, allowing for timely initiation of appropriate preventive measures."
"Association of age, baseline kidney function, and medication exposure with declines in creatinine clearance on pre-exposure prophylaxis: an observational cohort study.","Monica Gandhi, David V Glidden, Kenneth Mayer, Mauro Schechter, Susan Buchbinder, Beatriz Grinsztejn, Sybil Hosek, Martin Casapia, Juan Guanira, Linda-Gail Bekker, Alexander Louie, Howard Horng, Leslie Z Benet, Albert Liu, Robert M Grant, Monica Gandhiet al.",2016 Nov,Lancet HIV,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27658870/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      As pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine for the prevention of HIV infection is rolled out internationally, strategies to maintain effectiveness and to minimise adverse effects merit consideration. In this study, we aimed to assess reductions in renal function and predictors of renal toxicity in a large open-label study of PrEP.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      As part of the iPrEx open-label extension (OLE) study, men who have sex with men or transgender women aged 18-70 years who were HIV negative and had participated in three previous PrEP trials from Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and the USA were enrolled into an open-label PrEP study. There were no restrictions on current renal function for enrolment into iPrEx OLE, in which participants were given combination tablets of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) and emtricitabine (200 mg) and advised to take one tablet per day. At follow-up sessions every 12 weeks, participants' creatinine clearance on PrEP was estimated and in a subset of participants, hair samples were collected to measure tenofovir and emtricitabine concentrations (a measure of adherence and exposure) via liquid-chromatography-tandem-mass-spectrometry. Reductions in creatinine clearance from baseline were calculated and predictors of decline were identified by use of multivariate models. iPrEx is registered with ClinicalTrials.com, number NCT00458393.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Baseline characteristics were similar between all participants in iPrEx-OLE (1224 participants with 7475 person-visits) and those participating in the hair substudy (220 participants with 1114 person-visits). During a median of 72 weeks, the mean decline in creatinine clearance was -2·9% (95% CI -2·4 to -3·4; ptrend<0·0001), but declines were greater for those who started PrEP at older ages: participants aged 40-50 years at baseline had declines of -4·2% (95% CI -2·8 to -5·5) and participants older than 50 years at baseline had declines of -4·9% (-3·1 to -6·8). In multivariate models, age and baseline creatinine clearance less than 90 mL/min predicted declines in renal function. We identified a monotonic association between percentage decrease in creatinine clearance and the number of doses of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine taken per week, as estimated by hair concentrations of tenofovir and emtricitabine (ptrend=0·008).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Our data suggest that the frequency of safety monitoring for PrEP might need to be different between age groups and that pharmacological measures can monitor for toxic effects as well as adherence.

Preventing acute kidney injury and improving outcome in critically ill patients utilizing risk prediction score (PRAIOC-RISKS) study. A prospective controlled trial of AKI prevention.,"Tarek Samy Abdelaziz, Ragai Fouda, Wessam M Hussin, Mohamed S Elyamny, Yasser M Abdelhamid, Tarek Samy Abdelazizet al.",2020 Apr,J Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31712987/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) has significant impact on mortality and morbidity in critically ill patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective controlled interventional pilot study composed of observation and intervention arms was run at two different Intensive care unit (ICU) sites. A recently validated risk prediction score was used to predict the AKI in critically ill patients at high risk of developing AKI. All patients with established AKI at the time of recruitment were excluded from the study. A package of early preventive measures, including an early nephrology review was applied to high risk patients in the intervention arm to prevent AKI development.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We have recruited 108 patients at the intervention site and 98 patients at the observation site. The primary outcome measure was the AKI incidence. AKI incidence was significantly lower in the intervention arm than its incidence in the observation arm (11% vs 26%, p = 0.002). The median Time till recovery of AKI episodes was significantly lower in the intervention arm (3(1) vs. 5(2) days, p = 0.014) 0.30 day mortality was lower in the intervention arm, however, not statistically significant.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our pilot study showed that it was feasible to apply a simple risk score to implement early preventive measures to high risk patients, consequently, mitigating the risk of AKI development and reducing the time till recovery of AKI episodes. Multicentre studies are needed to confirm this favourable effect."
Independent predictors of acute kidney injury in patients with acute coronary syndrome after percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Aisulu Zhunuspekova, Jamilya Mansurova, Lyudmila Karazhanova, Aisulu Zhunuspekovaet al.",2021 Mar 4,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33661913/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      High residual platelet reactivity (RPR) in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) receiving antiplatelet agents has been associated with a high risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Study aim:
        
      
      This study aimed at identification of independent prognostic predictors of AKI risk in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after PCI.
    


          Study design, setting and patients:
        
      
      This was a prospective single-center clinical trial that included 155 patients (n = 119 without AKI, n = 36 with AKI, mean age 64.0±10.6 years, of whom 74.2% were males), who underwent PCI with stenting. We prospectively evaluated RPR using optical aggregometry. Development of AKI was the primary endpoint.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Acute renal dysfunction was observed in 36 patients (23.2%) after PCI, the risk factors of which according to univariate regression analysis were: age (p = 0.040), low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p = 0.001), having severe heart failure (HF) according to Killip (p<0.001), low level of hemoglobin (p = 0.026) and erythrocytes (p = 0.005), increased creatinine (p<0.001), low baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (p<0.001), low left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) (p = 0.003), high residual platelet reactivity (RPR) (p<0.001) and platelet aggregation area under the curve (AUC) with 10 μg/mL ADP (p<0.001), as well as dose of X-ray contrast medium (XCM) (p = 0.008). As a result of multivariate regression analysis the following independent predictors of AKI were established with the inclusion of the above factors: baseline creatinine level [OR 1.033 at 95% CI from 1.017 to 1.049; p<0.001], RPR with 10 μg/mL ADP [OR 1.060 at 95% CI from 1.027 to 1.094; p = 0.001], dose of an XCM [ОR 1.005 at 95% CI from 1.001 to 1.008; р = 0.014], diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [OR 0.926 at 95% CI from 0.888 to 0.965; p<0.001].
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      ADP-induced high residual platelet reactivity, baseline creatinine level, X-ray contrast medium, low diastolic blood pressure were independent predictors of AKI in patients with ACS after PCI."
The impact of minimal invasive extracorporeal circulation on postoperative kidney function.,"Ara Shwan Media, Peter Juhl-Olsen, Nils Erik Magnusson, Ivy Susanne Modrau, Ara Shwan Mediaet al.",2021 Oct,Perfusion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32921252/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery is a frequent complication associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Minimal invasive extracorporeal circulation is suggested to preserve postoperative renal function. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of minimal invasive versus conventional extracorporeal circulation on early postoperative kidney function.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Randomized controlled trail including 60 patients undergoing elective stand-alone coronary artery bypass graft surgery and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either minimal invasive (n = 30) or conventional extracorporeal circulation (n = 30). Postoperative kidney injury was assessed by elevation of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a sensitive tubular injury biomarker. In addition, we assessed changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the incidence of acute kidney injury according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) classification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We observed no differences between groups regarding increase of plasma NGAL (p = 0.31) or decline of eGFR (p = 0.82). In both groups, 6/30 patients developed acute kidney injury according to the AKIN classification, all regaining preoperative renal function within 30 days.

This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized study that aimed to evaluate the effect of RIPC on the early increase in serum creatinine (SCr) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which is associ-ated with contrast-induced acute kidney injury. Patients with stable angina undergoing elective PCI were assigned to control, RIPC, and continuous infusion of nicorandil (nicorandil) groups. The endpoint of this study was the incidence of the early increase in SCr, a predictor of contrast-induced acute kidney injury, which was defined as either a > 20% or absolute increase by 0.3 mg/dl of SCr levels after 24 h of PCI. This study included 220 patients for whom a dataset of SCr values was available. The incidence of the early increase in SCr was significantly lower in the RIPC than in the control (1.3% vs 10.8%, p = 0.03) group, but was not significantly different between the nicorandil and control groups. In multivariate analysis, RIPC remained a significant fac-tor associated with a reduction in the incidence of early increase in SCr. RIPC reduces the incidence of early increase in SCr in patients with stable angina following elective PCI."
Endothelial glycocalyx degradation and disease severity in Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi malaria.,"Bridget E Barber, Matthew J Grigg, Kim A Piera, Youwei Chen, Timothy William, J Brice Weinberg, Tsin W Yeo, Nicholas M Anstey, Bridget E Barberet al.",2021 May 7,Sci Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33963210/,No keywords found,"Degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx is associated with mortality in adult falciparum malaria. However, its role in the pathogenesis of non-falciparum malaria is unknown. In Malaysian patients with knowlesi (n = 200) and vivax (n = 61) malaria, and in healthy controls (n = 50), we measured glycocalyx breakdown products plasma syndecan-1 and urinary glycosaminoglycans, and evaluated correlations with biomarkers of disease severity. Urinary glycosaminoglycans were increased in patients with knowlesi and vivax malaria compared to healthy controls, and in knowlesi malaria were highest in those with severe disease. In knowlesi malaria, plasma syndecan-1 was also highest in those with severe disease, and correlated with markers of endothelial activation (angiopoietin-2, osteoprotegerin, ICAM-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and impaired microvascular reactivity. Syndecan-1 also correlated with endothelial activation (ICAM-1, angiopoietin-2) and ADMA in vivax malaria. In knowlesi malaria increased syndecan-1 was associated with acute kidney injury, after controlling for age and parasitemia. In knowlesi malaria, the difference in median syndecan-1 between severe and non-severe disease was more marked in females than males. Endothelial glycocalyx degradation is increased in knowlesi and vivax malaria, and associated with disease severity and acute kidney injury in knowlesi malaria. Agents that inhibit glycocalyx breakdown may represent adjunctive therapeutics for severe non-falciparum malaria."
Acute Kidney Outreach to Reduce Deterioration and Death (AKORDD) trial: the protocol for a large pilot study.,"Tarek Samy Abdelaziz, Antje Lindenmeyer, Jyoti Baharani, Hema Mistry, Alice Sitch, R Mark Temple, Gavin Perkins, Mark Thomas, Tarek Samy Abdelazizet al.",2016 Aug 19,BMJ Open,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27543592/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) contributes to morbidity and mortality, and its care is often suboptimal and/or delayed. The Acute Kidney Outreach to Reduce Deterioration and Death (AKORDD) study is a large pilot testing provision of early specialist advice, to improve outcomes for patients with AKI.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      This before and after study will test an Outreach service for adult patients with AKI, identified using the national algorithm. During the 2-month before phase, AKI outcomes (30-day mortality, need for dialysis or AKI stage deterioration) will be observed in the intervention and control hospitals and their respective community areas; no interventions will be delivered. Patients will receive good standard care. During the 5-month after phase, the intervention will be delivered to patients with AKI in the intervention hospital and its area. Patients with AKI in the control hospital and its area will continue to have good standard care only. Patients already on dialysis and at end of life will be excluded. The interventions will be initially delivered via a phone call, with or without a visit to the primary clinician, aiming at rapidly establishing the aetiology, correcting reversible causes and conducting further appropriate investigation. Surviving stage 3 patients will be followed-up in an AKI clinic. We will conduct qualitative research using focus group-based discussions with primary and secondary care clinicians during the early and late phases of the trial. This will help break down potential barriers and improve care delivery.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      Patients will be contacted about the study allowing them to 'opt out'. The work of an Outreach team, guided by AKI alerts and delivering timely advice to clinicians, may improve outcomes. If the results suggest that benefits are delivered by an AKI Outreach team, this study will lead to a full cluster randomised trial.

Comparison of two strategies for initiating renal replacement therapy in the intensive care unit: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (AKIKI).,"Stéphane Gaudry, David Hajage, Fréderique Schortgen, Laurent Martin-Lefevre, Florence Tubach, Bertrand Pons, Eric Boulet, Alexandre Boyer, Nicolas Lerolle, Guillaume Chevrel, Dorothée Carpentier, Alexandre Lautrette, Anne Bretagnol, Julien Mayaux, Marina Thirion, Philippe Markowicz, Guillemette Thomas, Jean Dellamonica, Jack Richecoeur, Michael Darmon, Nicolas de Prost, Hodane Yonis, Bruno Megarbane, Yann Loubières, Clarisse Blayau, Julien Maizel, Benjamin Zuber, Saad Nseir, Naïke Bigé, Isabelle Hoffmann, Jean-Damien Ricard, Didier Dreyfuss, Stéphane Gaudryet al.",2015 Apr 17:16:170.,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25902813/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      There is currently no validated strategy for the timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) when short-term life-threatening metabolic abnormalities are absent. No adequately powered prospective randomized study has addressed this issue to date. As a result, significant practice heterogeneity exists and may expose patients to either unnecessary hazardous procedures or undue delay in RRT.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label parallel-group clinical trial that compares the effect of two RRT initiation strategies on overall survival of critically ill patients receiving intravenous catecholamines or invasive mechanical ventilation and presenting with AKI classification stage 3 (KDIGO 2012). In the 'early' strategy, RRT is initiated immediately. In the 'delayed' strategy, clinical and metabolic conditions are closely monitored and RRT is initiated only when one or more events (severity criteria) occur, including: oliguria or anuria for more than 72 hours after randomization, serum urea concentration >40 mmol/l, serum potassium concentration >6 mmol/l, serum potassium concentration >5.5 mmol/l persisting despite medical treatment, arterial blood pH <7.15 in a context of pure metabolic acidosis (PaCO2 < 35 mmHg) or in a context of mixed acidosis with a PaCO2 ≥ 50 mmHg without possibility of increasing alveolar ventilation, acute pulmonary edema due to fluid overload despite diuretic therapy leading to severe hypoxemia requiring oxygen flow rate >5 l/min to maintain SpO2 > 95% or FiO2 > 50% under invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome measure is overall survival, measured from randomization (D0) until death, regardless of the cause. The minimum follow-up duration for each patient will be 60 days. Two interim analyses are planned, blinded to group allocation. It is expected that there will be 620 subjects in all.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The AKIKI study will be one of the very few large randomized controlled trials evaluating mortality according to the timing of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI classification stage 3 (KDIGO 2012). Results should help clinicians decide when to initiate RRT.

C-terminal agrin fragment (CAF) reflects renal function in patients suffering from severe sepsis or septic shock.,"Michael Drey, Michael Behnes, Robert Kob, Dominic Lepiorz, Stefan Hettwer, Cornelius Bollheimer, Cornel C Sieber, Thomas Bertsch, Ursula Hoffmann, Michael Dreyet al.",2015,Clin Lab,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25807640/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      One of the main causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients treated on an intensive care unit (ICU) is sepsis. The identification of new biomarkers indicating the early development and future course of AKI are of utmost medical interest. The C-terminal agrin fragment (CAF) is measurable in blood serum and might reflect kidney function. Therefore, this study evaluates CAF in patients presenting to an internal ICU with severe sepsis or septic shock. Serum levels of CAF are correlated with biomarkers of kidney function, markers of systemic inflammation, and the presence of AKI and renal replacement therapy (RRT).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      61 patients suffering from severe sepsis or septic shock were included during the first 24 hours of ICU treatment and blood samples for biomarker measurements, i.e., CAF, creatinine, cystatin C, procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin 6, C reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cells (WBC) were collected on the first day of intensive care treatment. The number of RRT days and the incidence of AKI were documented.
    


          Results:
        
      
      13% of the patients (8/61) suffered from SIRS/sepsis, 20% (12/61) from severe sepsis, and 67% (41/61) from septic shock. Serum levels of CAF significantly correlated with creatinine (r = 0.623, p < 0.001) and cystatin C (r = 0.578, p < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses adjusting CAF for inflammatory parameters (i.e., WBC, CRP, interleukin 6, PCT), age, and gender showed a strong correlation between CAF and creatinine (r = 0.643, p < 0.001). Serum levels of CAF were significantly associated with the need of RRT (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.772, 95% CI: 0.641-0.903, p = 0.002) and the incidence of AKI (AUC = 0.721, 95% CI: 591-0.850, p = 0.004) as indicated by ROC analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients suffering from severe sepsis and septic shock, serum levels of CAF were significantly associated with kidney function and RRT and were not influenced by severe septic conditions."
Coenzyme Q10 combined with trimetazidine in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with coronary heart disease complicated with renal dysfunction undergoing elective cardiac catheterization: a randomized control study and in vivo study.,"Fei Chen, Fan Liu, Jingchao Lu, Xiuchun Yang, Bing Xiao, Yaqiong Jin, Jie Zhang, Fei Chenet al.",2018 May 18,Eur J Med Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29776437/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is one of the common hospital-acquired acute renal failures. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and trimetazidine (TMZ) can prevent the occurrence of CIN after elective cardiac catheterization in patients with coronary artery disease complicated with renal dysfunction.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Consecutive coronary artery disease patients with renal insufficiency scheduled for coronary angiography were enrolled in randomized, paralleled, double-blind, controlled trial. The development of CIN was occurrence at the 48 or 72 h after the procedure. The changes of serum creatinine (SCr), eGFR, and Cys-C within 72 h after the procedure were measured and compared. In vivo contrast medium (CM)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) animal model was established, and CoQ10 plus TMZ was orally administrated to evaluate its renal protective effect.
    


          Results:
        
      
      150 patients with renal insufficiency were enrolled finally. CIN occurred in 21 (14.00%) of the 150 patients. 72 h after the procedure, the incidence of CIN was significantly lower in CoQ10 plus TMZ group compared with control group (6.67 vs. 21.3%, p = 0.01). No cardiac death occurred in this study. No side effects were observed after administration of CoQ10 and TMZ. In vivo test demonstrated that CoQ10 and TMZ could significantly reduce the concentration of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and SCR induced by CM i.v. injection, as well as tubular pathological injuries. Meanwhile, CoQ10 and TMZ could significantly reduce the oxidation stress in kidneys from CM-AKI animals.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      CoQ10 plus TMZ could decrease the incidence of CIN in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing elective cardiac catheterization, and their effect may be due to its strong anti-oxidation effect."
Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin for the Assessment of Reversible versus Persistent Renal Tubular Damage in ST-Segment Myocardial Infarction Patients.,"Ariel Banai, Keren-Lee Rozenfeld, Itamar Loewenstein, David Zahler, Moshe Shtark, Ilana Goldiner, Shmuel Banai, Yacov Shacham, Ariel Banaiet al.",2021,Blood Purif,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33756457/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Most studies investigated the value of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as a marker of renal tubular injury only at a single time point. We investigated the possible utilization of NGAL level dynamics for the identification of different renal injury patterns in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Blood samples for plasma NGAL in 132 STEMI patients were drawn immediately before and 24 h following primary coronary intervention. Abnormal elevation of NGAL levels was defined using the cardiac surgery-associated NGAL score with NGAL levels ≥100 ng/mL suggesting renal tubular damage. According to NGAL levels at 0 and 24 h, patients were stratified into 3 groups: no tubular damage (NGAL <100 ng/mL in both exams), reversible tubular damage (NGAL >100 ng/mL at 0 h but <100 ng/mL at 24 h), and persistent tubular damage (NGAL >100 ng/mL at both 0 and 24 h).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean age was 62 ± 13 years, and 78% were men. Of these patients, 29/132 (22%) demonstrated reversible tubular damage, and 36/132 (27%) persistent tubular damage. Only 13/132 patients (10%) progressed to clinical acute kidney injury during hospitalization, all of whom had persistent tubular injury. In multivariate regression model, symptom duration was independently associated with persistent tubular damage, both as continues variable (odds ratio [OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.04; p = 0.04) and for symptom duration >360 min (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.07-6.63; p = 0.03).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Renal tubular damage is common among STEMI patients. Dynamic NGAL measurement may differentiate between reversible and persistent tubular damage. Further trials are needed in order to assess the complex cardiorenal interactions."

      To investigate the efficacy of bilirubin reduction by hemoadsorption with CytoSorb® in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label, controlled pilot trial. Patients with ACLF, acute kidney injury, and serum bilirubin ≥5 mg/dL were assigned 1:1:1 to one of three study groups (CRRT with or without hemoadsorption, no CRRT). In the hemoadsorption group, the CytoSorb adsorber was incorporated into the CRRT system, replaced after 12, 24, and 48 h, and removed after 72 h. The primary endpoint was the serum bilirubin level after 72 h.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CYTOHEP was terminated early due to difficulties in recruiting patients and ethical concerns. Three of 9 patients (33%) were treated in each group. Comparing the three groups, mean bilirubin levels after 72 h were lower by -8.0 mg/dL in the ""CRRT with hemoadsorption"" group compared to ""CRRT without hemoadsorption"" (95% CI, -21.3 to 5.3 mg/dL; p = 0.17). The corresponding mean difference between ""CRRT without hemoadsorption"" and ""no CRRT"" was -1.4 mg/dL (95% CI, -14.2 to 11.5 mg/dL; p = 0.78). Comparing ""CRRT with hemoadsorption"" and ""no CRRT,"" it was -9.4 mg/dL (95% CI, -20.8 to 2.1 mg/dL; p = 0.0854). Only 1/9 patients (11%, ""no CRRT"" group) survived day 30 after study inclusion but died on day 89. IL-6, liver function parameters, and clinical scores were similar between the study groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      CYTOHEP failed to demonstrate that extracorporeal hemoadsorption combined with CRRT can reduce serum bilirubin in ACLF patients with acute kidney failure."
Rapid and Effective Elimination of Myoglobin with CytoSorb® Hemoadsorber in Patients with Severe Rhabdomyolysis.,"Frederic Albrecht, Stefan Schunk, Maren Fuchs, Thomas Volk, Juergen Geisel, Danilo Fliser, Andreas Meiser, Frederic Albrechtet al.",2024,Blood Purif,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37918366/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by destruction of muscle fibers by various causes and is diagnosed by increased creatine kinase concentrations in the blood. Myoglobin released into the blood may cause acute kidney injury. In this randomized controlled study, we hypothesized that myoglobin elimination would be faster when a hemoadsorber was added to a continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Four patients in the control group received CVVHD with a high cut-off hemofilter using high blood and dialysate flows for 48 h. Four patients in the CytoSorb group received the same treatment, but in addition, the hemoadsorber CytoSorb® was inserted in front of the hemofilter and replaced once after 24 h. Blood samples were drawn simultaneously before (pre) and after (post) the hemofilter or else the hemoadsorber, after 5 and 30 min, as well as after 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. All measurements were repeated the next day after the hemoadsorber had been renewed in the CytoSorb group. Primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of the relative myoglobin concentrations as percent of baseline. To evaluate the efficacy of myoglobin removal, relative reductions in myoglobin concentrations during one passage through each device at each time point were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients in the CytoSorb group had a significantly lower AUC during the first 24 h (42 ± 10% vs. 63 ± 6%, p = 0.029) as well as during the observation period of 48 h (26 ± 7% vs. 51 ± 12%, p = 0.029). The relative reductions for myoglobin were considerably higher in the CytoSorb group compared to the control group during the first 8 h.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Myoglobin concentrations declined considerably faster when CytoSorb was added to a CVVHD. When compared to a high-cut-off hemofilter, efficacy of CytoSorb in myoglobin elimination was much better. Because of saturation after 8-12 h an exchange may be necessary."
Comparing the effect of administering gelatin-low dose albumin versus albumin on renal function in liver transplantation: A randomized clinical trial.,"Samaneh Ghazanfar Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Khosravi, Mohammad Ali Sahmeddini, Mohammad Hossein Eghbal, Naeimehossadat Asmarian, Fatemeh Khalili, Pooya Vatankhah, Samaneh Ghazanfar Tehranet al.",2022 Nov,Clin Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35950553/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after liver transplantation (LT) that is independently associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of administering gelatin-low dose albumin versus albumin on renal function and other early outcomes in LT.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 140 patients undergoing LT from brain death donors. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: albumin or modified gelatin with albumin. Blood samples were collected before (T0) and on the first (T1), second (T2), third (T3), fifth (T4), and last day of hospitalization (T5) after LT for the detection of laboratory parameters, including renal and liver function tests.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of AKT on the basis of RIFLE criteria was 31.42% in the gelatin group (R: 59.10%, I: 36.40%, and F: 4.50%) and 25.71% in the albumin group (R: 66.70%, I: 27.80%, and F: 5.50%) (p = .845). Two patients in the gelatin and one in the albumin groups required renal replacement therapy (RRT). There was no significant difference between groups when the trends of changes in renal and liver function parameters were assessed during the study period (T0-T5). Furthermore, the incidence of complications was similar across groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study showed that modified gelatin could be used without inappropriate outcomes on renal function in patients with normal preoperative kidney function tests undergoing LT."

      Patients after cardiovascular surgery, requiring renal replacement therapy, can benefit from adequate non-heparin circuit anticoagulation. Simplified regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) protocol proposes the use of citric acid dextrose formula A (ACD-A) during post-dilutional continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with standard bicarbonate buffered calcium containing replacement solution. Citrate accumulation diagnosed upon total to ionized calcium ratio (tCa/iCa) and low ionized calcium (iCa) are considered as the biggest risks related to regional citrate accumulation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective observational case-control study evaluated electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis in cardiovascular surgery patients treated with post-dilution CVVH with a simplified RCA protocol with ACD-A. In total, 50 consecutive cardiovascular surgery patients were evaluated. Base excess, pH, bicarbonate, lactate, Na+, Cl-, Mg++, and inorganic phosphate concentrations, the total to ionized calcium ratio (tCa/iCa), and high anion gap metabolic acidosis were assessed during haemofiltration treatment in survivors and non-survivors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-three (66%) patients died. The therapies were very well balanced in sodium and chloride homeostasis. The lactate concentration and anion gap decreased during CVVH sessions lasting longer than 72 hours, but no inter-group difference was observed. The tCa/iCa ratio exceeded 4.5% and was significantly higher in non-survivors (p=0.037). Initial lactate concentration did not correlate with tCa/iCa ratio during haemofiltration. Magnesium and phosphate concentrations decreased and additional supplementation with magnesium was necessary. The magnesium concentration was lower in the non-survivors.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The incidence of citrate accumulation exceeded 4% and was significantly higher in non-survivors. Supplementation with magnesium and phosphate ions is needed in CVVH with RCA."

We also examined the difference in kidney damage between standard and dual lumen UAS. Sixty patients diagnosed with kidney stones and scheduled for RIRS were randomized into three groups: RIRS without UAS (Group 1), 11Fr/13Fr Boston scientific Navigator™ UAS (Group 2), and 11Fr/13Fr dual lumen ClearPetra™ UAS (Group 3). Data were prospectively collected in consecutive patients. Urine KIM-1/Cr levels were measured preoperatively, at postoperative 4 h, and on a postoperative day 14. Stone size, location, number, pre- and postoperative stent use, operation time, stone-free rate (SFR), post-ureteroscopic lesion scale (PULS) grade, hospitalization duration, and complications were recorded. There was no significant difference in demographical parameters and preoperative KIM-1/Cr levels among the groups. Postoperative 4th-hour urine KIM-1/Cr levels were higher in patients without UAS than patients with UAS (1.86, 0.67, 0.63 Groups 1, 2, 3, respectively). In comparing group 1 with groups 2 and 3 separately, Group 1 had a statistically significantly higher value than both groups (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, respectively). According to UAS type, there was no significant difference between groups 2 and 3. The use of UAS during RIRS has been shown to reduce kidney injury in the evaluation with KIM-1. Different UAS types on kidney injury and which one can protect the kidneys more during the procedure; will be elucidated by prospective randomized studies involving larger patient groups and UAS types."
Hydration for prevention of kidney injury after primary coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction: a randomised clinical trial.,"Yong Liu#, Ning Tan#, Yong Huo#, Shiqun Chen, Jin Liu, Yun-Dai Chen, Keng Wu, Guifu Wu, Kaihong Chen, Jianfeng Ye, Yan Liang, Xinwu Feng, Shaohong Dong, Qiming Wu, Xianhua Ye, Hesong Zeng, Minzhou Zhang, Min Dai, Chong-Yang Duan, Guoli Sun, Yibo He, Feier Song, Zhaodong Guo, Ping-Yan Chen, Junbo Ge, Ying Xian, Jiyan Chen, Yong Liuet al.",2022 May 25,Heart,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34509996/,No keywords found,"Objective:

          Methods:
        
      
      The Aggressive hydraTion in patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI to prevenT Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury study is an open-label, randomised controlled study at 15 teaching hospitals in China. A total of 560 adult patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive aggressive hydration or general hydration treatment. Aggressive hydration group received preprocedural loading dose of 125/250 mL normal saline within 30 min, followed by postprocedural hydration performed for 4 hours under left ventricular end-diastolic pressure guidance and additional hydration until 24 hours after pPCI. General hydration group received ≤500 mL 0.9% saline at 1 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours after randomisation. The primary end point is CI-AKI, defined as a >25% or 0.5 mg/dL increased in serum creatinine from baseline during the first 48-72 hours after primary angioplasty. The safety end point is acute heart failure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From July 2014 to May 2018, 469 patients were enrolled in the final analysis. CI-AKI occurred less frequently in aggressive hydration group than in general hydration group (21.8% vs 31.1%; risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96). Acute heart failure did not significantly differ between the aggressive hydration group and the general hydration group (8.1% vs 6.4%, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.44). Several subgroup analysis showed the better effect of aggressive hydration in CI-AKI prevention in male, renal insufficient and non-anterior myocardial infarction participants.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Comparing with general hydration, the peri-operative aggressive hydration seems to be safe and effective in preventing CI-AKI among patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI."
Effect of Regional Citrate Anticoagulation vs Systemic Heparin Anticoagulation During Continuous Kidney Replacement Therapy on Dialysis Filter Life Span and Mortality Among Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Alexander Zarbock, Mira Küllmar, Detlef Kindgen-Milles, Carola Wempe, Joachim Gerss, Timo Brandenburger, Thomas Dimski, Bartosz Tyczynski, Michael Jahn, Nils Mülling, Martin Mehrländer, Peter Rosenberger, Gernot Marx, Tim Philipp Simon, Ulrich Jaschinski, Philipp Deetjen, Christian Putensen, Jens-Christian Schewe, Stefan Kluge, Dominik Jarczak, Torsten Slowinski, Marc Bodenstein, Patrick Meybohm, Stefan Wirtz, Onnen Moerer, Andreas Kortgen, Philipp Simon, Sean M Bagshaw, John A Kellum, Melanie Meersch                              ;, RICH Investigators and the Sepnet Trial Group, Alexander Zarbocket al.",2020 Oct 27,JAMA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33095849/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Although current guidelines suggest the use of regional citrate anticoagulation (which involves the addition of a citrate solution to the blood before the filter of the extracorporeal dialysis circuit) as first-line treatment for continuous kidney replacement therapy in critically ill patients, the evidence for this recommendation is based on few clinical trials and meta-analyses.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine the effect of regional citrate anticoagulation, compared with systemic heparin anticoagulation, on filter life span and mortality.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      A parallel-group, randomized multicenter clinical trial in 26 centers across Germany was conducted between March 2016 and December 2018 (final date of follow-up, January 21, 2020). The trial was terminated early after 596 critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury or clinical indications for initiation of kidney replacement therapy had been enrolled.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were randomized to receive either regional citrate anticoagulation (n = 300), which consisted of a target ionized calcium level of 1.0 to 1.40 mg/dL, or systemic heparin anticoagulation (n = 296), which consisted of a target activated partial thromboplastin time of 45 to 60 seconds, for continuous kidney replacement therapy.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Coprimary outcomes were filter life span and 90-day mortality. Secondary end points included bleeding complications and new infections.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 638 patients randomized, 596 (93.4%) (mean age, 67.5 years; 183 [30.7%] women) completed the trial. In the regional citrate group vs systemic heparin group, median filter life span was 47 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 19-70 hours) vs 26 hours (IQR, 12-51 hours) (difference, 15 hours [95% CI, 11 to 20 hours]; P < .001). Ninety-day all-cause mortality occurred in 150 of 300 patients vs 156 of 296 patients (Kaplan-Meier estimator percentages, 51.2% vs 53.6%; unadjusted difference, -2.4% [95% CI, -10.5% to 5.8%]; unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.72 to 1.13]; unadjusted P = .38; adjusted difference, -6.1% [95% CI, -12.6% to 0.4%]; primary adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.004]; primary adjusted P = .054). Of 38 prespecified secondary end points, 34 showed no significant difference. Compared with the systemic heparin group, the regional citrate group had significantly fewer bleeding complications (15/300 [5.1%] vs 49/296 [16.9%]; difference, -11.8% [95% CI, -16.8% to -6.8%]; P < .001) and significantly more new infections (204/300 [68.0%] vs 164/296 [55.4%]; difference, 12.6% [95% CI, 4.9% to 20.3%]; P = .002).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy, anticoagulation with regional citrate, compared with systemic heparin anticoagulation, resulted in significantly longer filter life span. The trial was terminated early and was therefore underpowered to reach conclusions about the effect of anticoagulation strategy on mortality.

      To compare the efficacy of intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in patients with chronic renal failure complicated by massive intracerebral hemorrhage.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixty-two patients were randomly and equally divided into IHD and CVVH groups. The clinical variables were compared, including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score as the primary indicator, cerebral edema volume, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) incidence, acute heart failure (AHF) incidence, rehemorrhage incidence, hospital stay length, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The CVVH group had lower NIHSS scores and edema volumes than the IHD group on postoperative days 7 and 14. Moreover, in the CVVH group, (i) the NIHSS scores on postoperative days 3 and 7 were higher than those on postoperative day 1; (ii) there was no significant difference in NIHSS scores between days 14 and 1; and (iii) no significant difference in cerebral edema volume was found between postoperative days 1 and 3, 7, and 14. In the IHD group, the NIHSS scores and cerebral edema volume on postoperative days 7 and 14 were significantly higher than those on postoperative day 1. The CVVH group had a lower incidence of HAP, AHF, and adverse events and shorter hospital stay length than the IHD group. The proportions of patients with mRS scores of 1 and 2 in the CVVH group were higher than those in the IHD group on day 30 after discharge.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      CVVH is more effective than IHD in the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure complicated by massive intracerebral hemorrhage."

          Method:
        
      
      A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot trial was conducted. The authors enrolled children aged 1-mo (corrected) to 12-y, who were diagnosed with AKI (""risk"" stage) using pediatric-Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End stage kidney disease (p-RIFLE) criteria, and achieved immediate resuscitation goals within 24 h of admission. Participants received either furosemide (0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg/h) or placebo (5%-dextrose) infusion. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients progressing to a higher stage (injury or failure). Secondary outcomes were (i) need for renal replacement therapy, (ii) the effect on neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (urine and blood), (iii) fluid balance, (iv) adverse effects, (v) time to achieve renal recovery, (vi) duration of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation, and (vii) all-cause 28-d mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial was stopped for futility, and data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis (furosemide-group: n = 38; placebo-group: n = 37). No significant difference was noted in the progression of AKI to a higher stage between furosemide and placebo groups (10.5% vs. 21.6%; relative risk = 0.49, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.48) (p = 0.22). There were no differences in the secondary outcomes between the study groups. All-cause 28-d mortality was similar between the groups (10.5% vs. 10.8%).

Characteristics and associated factors of acute kidney injury among adult dengue patients: A retrospective single-center study.,"Ajib Diptyanusa, Weerapong Phumratanaprapin, Benjaluck Phonrat, Kittiyod Poovorawan, Borimas Hanboonkunupakarn, Natthida Sriboonvorakul, Usa Thisyakorn, Ajib Diptyanusaet al.",2019 Jan 7,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30615667/,No keywords found,"Severe dengue cases have been increasingly reported in Thailand, and the under-reporting of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cases of dengue viral infection has become an obstacle in obtaining an accurate description of the true nature and epidemiology of AKI. Because AKI may lead to patient morbidity and mortality, an early diagnosis is important in preventing its onset in dengue patients. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and associated factors of AKI among adult dengue patients. This retrospective study reviewed admission data from the medical records of adult dengue patients admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases between January 2012 and November 2017 and stratified these patients into AKI and non-AKI groups using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria (KDIGO). A total of 1,484 patients were included in the study, with 71 categorized into the AKI group. The prevalence of AKI was 4.8%. In the AKI group, the predominant age range was 18-40 years (71.8%), with a female to male ratio of 1:2.7. These patients showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher proportions of altered consciousness, dyspnea, low mean arterial blood pressure, high-grade fever, major bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, severe transaminitis, coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, proteinuria, hematuria, and pyuria. Our study established that older age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, obesity, severe dengue, and coexisting bacterial infection were significant associated factors for AKI in dengue by multivariate analysis. A total of 10 (14.1%) patients with AKI received dialysis, among which 9 (12.7%) patients from the AKI group died. Our findings suggest that an awareness of AKI, its early diagnosis, and evaluation of clinical and laboratory characteristics of dengue patients will help clinicians to initiate appropriate therapy for dengue-associated AKI."

      Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is produced in response to tubular injury. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is associated with adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We sought to characterize blood NGAL level and the degree of kidney injury in CKD patients who underwent coronary angiography.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study was a prospective, blinded assessment of blood samples obtained from patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) between 15 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 undergoing elective coronary angiography with iodinated contrast. Blood NGAL and serum creatinine were measured at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after contrast administration.

      A total of 63 subjects with a mean eGFR of 48.17±16.45 mL/min/1.73 m2 were enrolled. There was a graded increase in baseline NGAL levels across worsening stages of CKD (p=0.0001). Post-procedure NGAL increased from baseline in each stage of CKD. Eight (12.7%) patients were diagnosed with CI-AKI by diagnostic criteria of 2012 KDIGO definition of CI-AKI, and seven (11.1%) patients developed subclinical CI-AKI defined by a twofold or greater rise in NGAL. There was no relationship between baseline eGFR and diabetes on the composite outcome of subclinical and clinical CI-AKI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Baseline and post-procedure NGAL are progressively elevated according to the baseline stage of CKD. Using a twofold rise in NGAL, 46.7% of composite CI-AKI is detected and complements the 53.3% of cases identified using KDIGO criteria. Traditional risk predictors were not independently associated with this composite outcome."
Nitric oxide delivery during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces acute kidney injury: A randomized trial.,"Nikolay O Kamenshchikov, Yana J Anfinogenova, Boris N Kozlov, Yulia S Svirko, Stanislav E Pekarskiy, Vladimir V Evtushenko, Vladimir A Lugovsky, Vladimir M Shipulin, Vladimir V Lomivorotov, Yuriy K Podoksenov, Nikolay O Kamenshchikovet al.",2022 Apr,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32718702/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nitric oxide (NO) supplementation to the CPB circuit on the development of cardiac surgery-associated AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective randomized controlled study included 96 patients with moderate risk of renal complications who underwent elective cardiac surgery with CPB. The study protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT03527381). Patients were randomly allocated to either NO supplementation to the CPB bypass circuit (NO treatment group; n = 48) or usual care (control group; n = 48). In the NO treatment group, 40-ppm NO was administered during the entire CPB period. The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      NO treatment was associated with a significant decrease in AKI incidence (10 cases [20.8%] vs 20 cases [41.6%] in the control group; relative risk, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.95; P = .023) and a higher median urine output during CPB (2.6 mL/kg/h [interquartile range (IQR), 2.1-5.08 mL/kg/h] vs 1.7 mL/kg/h [IQR, 0.80-2.50 mL/kg/h]; P = .0002). The median urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level at 4 hours after surgery was significantly lower in the NO treatment group (1.12 ng/mL [IQR, 0.75-5.8 ng/mL] vs 4.62 ng/mL [IQR, 2.02-34.55 ng/mL]; P = .005). In the NO treatment group, concentrations of NO metabolites were significantly increased at 5 minutes postclamping, at 5 minutes after declamping, and at the end of the operation. Concentrations of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators and free plasma hemoglobin did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      NO administration in patients at moderate risk of renal complications undergoing elective cardiac surgery with CPB was associated with a lower incidence of AKI."
The use of urinary biomarkers to predict acute kidney injury in children after liver transplant.,"Dana Y Fuhrman, John A Kellum, Emily L Joyce, Yosuke Miyashita, George V Mazariegos, Armando Ganoza, James E Squires, Dana Y Fuhrmanet al.",2020 Feb,Pediatr Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31652022/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      AKI after pediatric liver transplantation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The role of urinary biomarkers for the prediction of AKI in pediatric patients after liver transplantation has not been previously reported. The primary objective of this prospective pilot study was to determine the predictive capabilities of urinary KIM-1, NGAL, TIMP-2, and IGFBP7 for diagnosing AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixteen children undergoing liver transplantation were enrolled in the study over a 19-month time period. The Kidney Disease Improving Outcomes criteria for urine output and serum creatinine were used to define AKI. Predictive ability was evaluated using the area under the curve obtained by ROC analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      AKI occurred in 6 (37.5%) of the patients between 2 and 4 days after transplant. There were no differences in any of the biomarkers prior to transplant. When obtained within 6 hours after transplant, the area under the ROC curve for predicting AKI was 0.758 (95% CI: 0.458-1.00) for KIM-1, 0.900 (95% CI: 0.724-1.00) for NGAL, and 0.933 (95% CI: 0.812-1.00) for the product of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 ([TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results show that both NGAL and [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] provide significant discrimination for AKI risk following liver transplant in children. Larger studies are needed to determine the optimal time point for measuring these biomarkers and to validate our findings."
Effects of remote ischemic preconditioning in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery (Remote IMPACT): a randomized controlled trial.,"Michael Walsh, Richard Whitlock, Amit X Garg, Jean-François Légaré, Andra E Duncan, Robert Zimmerman, Scott Miller, Stephen Fremes, Teresa Kieser, Ganesan Karthikeyan, Matthew Chan, Anthony Ho, Vivian Nasr, Jessica Vincent, Imtiaz Ali, Ronit Lavi, Daniel I Sessler, Robert Kramer, Jeff Gardner, Summer Syed, Tomas VanHelder, Gordon Guyatt, Purnima Rao-Melacini, Lehana Thabane, P J Devereaux                              ;, Remote IMPACT Investigators, Michael Walshet al.",2016 Mar 15,CMAJ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26668200/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Remote ischemic preconditioning is a simple therapy that may reduce cardiac and kidney injury. We undertook a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of this therapy on markers of heart and kidney injury after cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients at high risk of death within 30 days after cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to undergo remote ischemic preconditioning or a sham procedure after induction of anesthesia. The preconditioning therapy was three 5-minute cycles of thigh ischemia, with 5 minutes of reperfusion between cycles. The sham procedure was identical except that ischemia was not induced. The primary outcome was peak creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) within 24 hours after surgery (expressed as multiples of the upper limit of normal, with log transformation). The secondary outcome was change in creatinine level within 4 days after surgery (expressed as log-transformed micromoles per litre). Patient-important outcomes were assessed up to 6 months after randomization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We randomly assigned 128 patients to remote ischemic preconditioning and 130 to the sham therapy. There were no significant differences in postoperative CK-MB (absolute mean difference 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.07 to 0.36) or creatinine (absolute mean difference 0.06, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.23). Other outcomes did not differ significantly for remote ischemic preconditioning relative to the sham therapy: for myocardial infarction, relative risk (RR) 1.35 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.17); for acute kidney injury, RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.78); for stroke, RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.34 to 3.07); and for death, RR 1.47 (95% CI 0.65 to 3.31).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Remote ischemic precnditioning did not reduce myocardial or kidney injury during cardiac surgery. This type of therapy is unlikely to substantially improve patient-important outcomes in cardiac surgery.

Preoperative risk assessment improves biomarker detection for predicting acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery.,"Cheng-Chia Lee, Chih-Hsiang Chang, Shao-Wei Chen, Pei-Chun Fan, Su-Wei Chang, Yi-Ting Chen, Yu-Yun Nan, Pyng-Jing Lin, Feng-Chun Tsai, Cheng-Chia Leeet al.",2018 Sep 4,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30180211/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Although urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has emerged as a promising biomarker for the early detection of kidney injury, previous studies of adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery have reported only moderate discrimination. The age, creatinine, and ejection fraction (ACEF) score is a preoperative validated risk model with satisfactory accuracy for predicting AKI following cardiac surgery. It remains unknown whether combining preoperative risk assessment through ACEF scores followed by urinary NGAL test in a population of high-risk individuals is an optimal approach with improved predictive performance.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      A total of 177 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery were enrolled. Clinical characteristics, prognostic model scores, and outcomes were assessed. Urinary NGAL were examined within 6 hours after cardiac surgery. Patients were stratified according to preoperative ACEF scores, and comparisons were made using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) for the prediction of AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 45.8% (81/177) of the patients had AKI. As expected, patients with ACEF scores ≥ 1.1 were older and more likely to have class III or IV heart failure. They were also more likely to have diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease. Urinary NGAL alone moderately predicted AKI, with an AUROC of 0.732. Risk stratification by ACEF scores ≥ 1.1 substantially improved the AUROC of urinary NGAL to 0.873 (95% confidence interval, 0.784-0.961; P < .001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Risk stratification by preoperative ACEF scores ≥ 1.1, followed by postoperative urinary NGAL, provides more satisfactory risk discrimination than does urinary NGAL alone for the early detection of AKI after cardiac surgery. Future studies should investigate whether this strategy could improve the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of care in patients undergoing cardiac surgery."
Effect of intraoperative low vs. conventional tidal volume on the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury after noncardiac surgery: a two-center randomized clinical trial.,"Xiao-Yu Jia, Xu-Ru Wang, Yan-Yu Jiang, Ming-Zi An, Da-Qing Pei, Zhen-Ping Li, Qing-He Zhou, Xiao-Yu Jiaet al.",2023 Sep,Minerva Anestesiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36943711/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      In adults undergoing noncardiac surgery, the correlation between intraoperative tidal volume and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of low tidal volume ventilation on the incidence of postoperative AKI compared with conventional tidal volume in adults undergoing noncardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a two-center prospective randomized controlled trial on adult patients who underwent noncardiac surgery and had a mechanical ventilation of >60 min. Patients were randomized to receive either a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg pre-predicted body weight (PBW, low tidal volume) or a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg pre-predicted body weight (conventional tidal volume). The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI after non-cardiac surgery. Appropriate statistical methods were used for this study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among the 1982 randomized patients, 943 with low tidal volume and 958 with conventional tidal volume were evaluable for the primary outcome. Postoperative AKI occurred in 12 patients (1.3%) in the low tidal volume group and 11 patients (1.1%) in the conventional tidal volume group, with an odds ratio of 0.889 (95%CI, 0.391-2.03) and a relative risk of 0.999 ([95%CI, 0.989-1.01]; P=0.804). Postoperative serum creatinine levels increased in 284 (30.0%) patients with low tidal volume compared to 316 (32.0%) patients with conventional tidal volume (P=0.251). No difference in postoperative serum creatinine levels was found between the two groups (57.5 [49.0-68.2] μmol/L vs. 58.8[50.4-69.5] μmol/L, P=0.056).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among adults undergoing noncardiac surgery, low tidal volume mechanical ventilation did not significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative AKI compared with conventional tidal volume."
Randomized Trial of Bicarbonate or Saline Study for the Prevention of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy in Patients with CKD.,"Richard Solomon, Paul Gordon, Steven V Manoukian, J Dawn Abbott, Dean J Kereiakes, Allen Jeremias, Michael Kim, Harold L Dauerman                              ;, BOSS Trial Investigators, Richard Solomonet al.",2015 Sep 4,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26185263/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Sodium bicarbonate has been proposed for protection of the kidney from contrast-induced AKI (CIAKI). However, the effects of bicarbonate on long-term important clinical outcomes are uncertain.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      In a prospective, double-blind, multicenter randomized clinical trial, 391 patients with an eGFR<45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) undergoing elective coronary or peripheral angiography were randomized to an infusion with a high dose of isotonic sodium bicarbonate (target 2.0 mEq/kg) or a similar molar amount of isotonic sodium chloride. The primary outcome was a composite of mortality, dialysis, or a sustained 20% reduction in eGFR at 6 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 391 patients enrolled between March 2010 and May 2012. The incidence of the primary outcome was 14.9% in the bicarbonate group and 16.3% in the control group in the intention-to-treat population (P=0.78). There was also no difference in the incidence of CIAKI between the treatment groups (14.5% versus 12.1%, respectively; P=0.20). CIAKI was associated with a higher incidence of sustained loss of kidney function at 6 months compared with those without CIAKI (21.2% versus 7.7%, respectively; P=0.06).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      High-dose sodium bicarbonate infusion in patients with eGFR<45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) undergoing angiography did not demonstrate a difference in incidence of the composite of death, dialysis, or sustained 6-month reduction in eGFR or CIAKI compared with sodium chloride."
Acute Kidney Injury Defined by Fluid-Corrected Creatinine in Premature Neonates: A Secondary Analysis of the PENUT Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Michelle C Starr, Russell L Griffin, Matthew W Harer, Danielle E Soranno, Katja M Gist, Jeffrey L Segar, Shina Menon, Lindsey Gordon, David J Askenazi, David T Selewski, Michelle C Starret al.",2023 Aug 1,JAMA Netw Open,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37561461/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) and disordered fluid balance are common in premature neonates; a positive fluid balance dilutes serum creatinine, and a negative fluid balance concentrates serum creatinine, both of which complicate AKI diagnosis. Correcting serum creatinine for fluid balance may improve diagnosis and increase diagnostic accuracy for AKI.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether correcting serum creatinine for fluid balance would identify additional neonates with AKI and alter the association of AKI with short-term and long-term outcomes.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This study was a post hoc cohort analysis of the Preterm Erythropoietin Neuroprotection Trial (PENUT), a phase 3, randomized clinical trial of erythropoietin, conducted at 19 academic centers and 30 neonatal intensive care units in the US from December 2013 to September 2016. Participants included extremely premature neonates born at less than 28 weeks of gestation. Data analysis was conducted in December 2022.
    


          Exposure:
        
      
      Diagnosis of fluid-corrected AKI during the first 14 postnatal days, calculated using fluid-corrected serum creatinine (defined as serum creatinine multiplied by fluid balance [calculated as percentage change from birth weight] divided by total body water [estimated 80% of birth weight]).
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was invasive mechanical ventilation on postnatal day 14. Secondary outcomes included death, hospital length of stay, and severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Categorical variables were analyzed by proportional differences with the χ2 test or Fisher exact test. The t test and Wilcoxon rank sums test were used to compare continuous and ordinal variables, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the association of exposure with outcomes of interest were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 923 premature neonates (479 boys [51.9%]; median [IQR] birth weight, 801 [668-940] g) were included, of whom 215 (23.3%) received a diagnosis of AKI using uncorrected serum creatinine. After fluid balance correction, 13 neonates with AKI were reclassified as not having fluid-corrected AKI, and 111 neonates previously without AKI were reclassified as having fluid-corrected AKI (ie, unveiled AKI). Therefore, fluid-corrected AKI was diagnosed in 313 neonates (33.9%). Neonates with unveiled AKI were similar in clinical characteristics to those with AKI whose diagnoses were made with uncorrected serum creatinine. Compared with those without AKI, neonates with unveiled AKI were more likely to require ventilation (81 neonates [75.0%] vs 254 neonates [44.3%] and have longer hospital stays (median [IQR], 102 [84-124] days vs 90 [71-110] days). In multivariable analysis, a diagnosis of fluid-corrected AKI was associated with increased odds of adverse clinical outcomes, including ventilation (adjusted OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.56-3.18) and severe BPD (adjusted OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.15-3.64).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      In this post hoc cohort study of premature neonates, fluid correction increased the number of premature neonates with a diagnosis of AKI and was associated with increased odds of adverse clinical outcomes, including ventilation and BPD. Failing to correct serum creatinine for fluid balance underestimates the prevalence and impact of AKI in premature neonates. Future studies should consider correcting AKI for fluid balance.

Absence of Kidney Tubular Injury in Patients With Acute Heart Failure With Acute Kidney Injury.,"Stephen Duff, Nicholas Wettersten, Yu Horiuchi, Dirk J van Veldhuisen, Sagar Raturi, Ruairi Irwin, Jean Maxime Côté, Alan Maisel, Joachim H Ix, Patrick T Murray, Stephen Duffet al.",2024 Nov,Circ Heart Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39421939/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Worsening renal function (WRF) is common in hospitalized patients being treated for acute heart failure. However, discriminating clinically significant WRF remains challenging. In patients hospitalized with acute heart failure, we evaluated if blood and urine biomarkers of cardiac and kidney dysfunction were associated with adverse outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We identified 175 of 927 participants in the AKINESIS study (Acute Kidney Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin Evaluation of Symptomatic Heart Failure Study) who met criteria for stage 1 or 2 Kidney Disease: Improvement Global Outcomes acute kidney injury during the first 3 days of hospitalization. We measured 24 blood and urine biomarkers from specimens collected within 24 hours of meeting acute kidney injury criteria. The primary composite outcome consisted of worsening WRF (higher acute kidney injury stage), need for dialysis, or death at 30 days. Biomarkers' association with the composite outcome was assessed with logistic regression by tertiles and area under the curve (AUC).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 175 participants, 32 (18%) developed the primary composite outcome. Only history of chronic kidney disease was significantly different between those with and without the composite outcome. The highest tertile of plasma Gal-3 (galectin-3) and urine epidermal growth factor were associated with increased odds of the composite outcome compared with the lowest tertile in unadjusted analyses. After adjusting for serum creatinine, systolic blood pressure, and blood urea nitrogen, only the highest tertile of Gal-3 was associated with greater odds of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 4.6 [95% CI, 1.4-16.0). Gal-3 had the highest AUC (0.70 [95% CI, 0.58-0.82]), while epidermal growth factor had a lower AUC (0.63 [95% CI, 0.53-0.74]). Notably, urine biomarkers of kidney tubule injury were not associated with the composite outcome.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Tubular injury does not occur in most patients with acute heart failure experiencing WRF, consistent with the functional mechanisms of WRF in this patient population.

Incidence and outcomes of acute kidney disease in patients after type A aortic dissection surgery.,"Xuelian Chen, Miao Fang, Jia Yang, Siwen Wang, Xin Wang, Linji Li, Jiaojiao Zhou, Lichuan Yang, Xuelian Chenet al.",2023 Mar,Asian J Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36050242/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI), acute kidney disease (AKD) and CKD (chronic kidney disease) were a continuous process. There has been little discussion of risk factors for AKD in the population undergoing surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The main objective of this study was to investigate the risk factors for AKD after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection and the impact of AKD on early and late mortality.
    


          Design:
        
      
      AKI was to be defined as an increase in serum creatinine to >0.3 mg/dL or 1.5 times above baseline within 7 days. AKD was defined as the kidney damage within 90 days after AKI. Logistic regression models were performed to identify the risk factors of AKD and the association between AKD and early mortality after AAAD surgery.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Patients with AKI after AAAD surgery admitted in ICU from March 2009 to September 2021 were included.
    


          Key results:
        
      
      Among the 328 patients who developed AKI after AAAD surgery, 98 patients (29.9%) progressed to AKD. Multivariable analysis revealed that AKI stage 2 (OR, 3.032) and AKI stage 3 (OR, 4.001) have been shown to be independent risk factors for the development of AKD. AKD (OR, 3.175) proved to be an independent risk factor for early mortality, while no significant difference in late mortality was observed between patients in the AKD and non-AKD groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The severity of AKI after surgery of AAAD was independently associated with AKD. The occurrence of AKD had a negative impact on early mortality.

A randomized and prospective controlled study was performed between June and December 2013. We enrolled 29 consecutive patients with renal calculi > 2 cm and who underwent PNL, as well as 47 healthy control subjects. Urine samples, including 2 h before surgery, 2 and 24 h after surgery were collected from the patient group. Freshly voided urine samples were collected from the control group. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), and liver-type fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) levels were measured from these urine samples. The mean KIM-1/Cr value that measured 24 h after the operation was statistically significant, higher than its preoperative (preop) level (p = 0.045). A significant difference was detected between the mean preop and postoperative (postop) 24 h NAG/Cr values (p < 0.001). Also, postop 24 h NGAL/Cr levels were statistically significant, higher than its preop levels (p = 0.013). According to the comparison of preop and postop levels, an increase in LFABP/Cr values secondary to surgical intervention was observed without any statistically significant difference. Besides the LFABP/Cr levels do not change after percutaneous kidney surgery, KIM-1/Cr, NAG/Cr, and NGAL/Cr levels increase postop period, especially at 24 h. Further studies with a larger series and repeated measurements should be performed to clarify if they can be used to demonstrate renal damage after percutaneous surgery or not."

No difference was found in electrolyte concentrations between the commercial and improvised replacement solutions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The ImpRRT system achieved similar performance to CRRT and may represent a potential option for temporary RRT following disasters."
ABT-719 for the Prevention of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing High-Risk Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Phase 2b Clinical Trial.,"Peter A McCullough, Elliott Bennett-Guerrero, Lakhmir S Chawla, Thomas Beaver, Ravindra L Mehta, Bruce A Molitoris, Ann Eldred, Greg Ball, Ho-Jin Lee, Mark T Houser, Samina Khan, Peter A McCulloughet al.",2016 Aug 20,J Am Heart Assoc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27543797/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Patients undergoing cardiac surgeries with cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump) have a high risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). We tested ABT-719, a novel α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analog, for prevention of AKI in postoperative cardiac surgery patients.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      This phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included adult patients with stable renal function undergoing high-risk on-pump cardiac surgery in the United States and Denmark. Participants received placebo (n=61) or cumulative ABT-719 doses of 800 (n=59), 1600 (n=61), or 2100 μg/kg (n=59). Primary outcome was development of AKI based on Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria, measured utilizing preoperative creatinine value and maximum value within 48 hours and urine output within the first 42 hours postsurgery. Secondary outcomes included incidence of AKI based on maximal changes from baseline in novel AKI biomarkers over a 72-hour period after clamp release and length of intensive care unit stays through 90 days postsurgery. A total of 65.5%, 62.7%, and 69.6% of patients in the 800-, 1600-, and 2100-μg/kg groups, respectively, developed AKI (stages 1, 2, and 3 combined) versus 65.5% in the placebo group (for each pair-wise comparison with placebo, P=0.966, 0.815, and 0.605, respectively). Adverse events occurred at a similar rate in all treatment groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      ABT-719 treatment did not lower AKI incidence using AKIN criteria, influence the elevations of novel biomarkers, or change 90-day outcomes in patients after cardiac surgery.

Early Allograft Dysfunction After Liver Transplantation Is Associated With Short- and Long-Term Kidney Function Impairment.,"H M Wadei, D D Lee, K P Croome, M L Mai, E Golan, R Brotman, A P Keaveny, C B Taner, H M Wadeiet al.",2016 Mar,Am J Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26663518/,"clinical research/practice, complication: medical/metabolic, delayed graft function (DGF), graft survival, kidney disease, kidney transplantation/nephrology, liver allograft function/dysfunction, liver transplantation/hepatology.","Early allograft dysfunction (EAD) after liver transplantation (LT) is related to ischemia-reperfusion injury and may lead to a systemic inflammatory response and extrahepatic organ dysfunction. We evaluated the effect of EAD on new-onset acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy within the first month and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within the first year post-LT in 1325 primary LT recipients. EAD developed in 358 (27%) of recipients. Seventy-one (5.6%) recipients developed AKI and 38 (2.9%) developed ESRD. Compared with those without EAD, recipients with EAD had a higher risk of AKI and ESRD (4% vs. 9% and 2% vs. 6%, respectively, p < 0.001 for both). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed an independent relationship between EAD and AKI as well as ESRD (odds ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 1.9-6.4, and odds ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval 11.9-91.2, respectively). Patients who experienced both EAD and AKI had inferior 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year patient and graft survival compared with those with either EAD or AKI alone, while those who had neither AKI nor EAD had the best outcomes (p < 0.001). Post-LT EAD is a risk factor for both AKI and ESRD and should be considered a target for future intervention to reduce post-LT short- and long-term renal dysfunction."
Intensity of Renal Replacement Therapy and Duration of Mechanical Ventilation: Secondary Analysis of the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study.,"Shilpa Sharma, Yvelynne P Kelly, Paul M Palevsky, Sushrut S Waikar, Shilpa Sharmaet al.",2020 Oct,Chest,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32470389/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Randomized clinical trials have failed to show benefit from increasing intensity of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute kidney injury, but continue to be frequently used. In addition, intensive RRT is associated with an increase in adverse events potentially secondary to small solute losses, such as phosphate. We hypothesized that, compared with less-intensive RRT, intensive RRT would lead to longer duration of mechanical ventilation.
    


          Research question:
        
      
      Does more-intensive renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury increase time to extubation from mechanical ventilation when compared with less-intensive therapy?
    


          Study design and methods:
        
      
      The Acute Renal Failure Trial Network study was a randomized multicenter trial of more-intensive (hemodialysis or sustained low-efficiency dialysis six times per week or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration at 35 mL/kg per hour) vs less-intensive (hemodialysis or sustained low-efficiency dialysis three times per week or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration at 20 mL/kg per hour) RRT in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. Of 1124 patients, 907 who were supported by mechanical ventilation on study initiation were included in this Cox-proportional hazards analysis. The primary outcome was the time to first successful extubation off mechanical ventilation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients who were assigned randomly to more-intensive RRT had a 33.3% lower hazard rate of successful extubation (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.88; P < .001) when compared with patients who were assigned to less-intensive RRT. Patients who were assigned to more-intensive RRT had, on average, 2.07 ventilator-free days, compared with 3.08 days in those who were assigned to less-intensive RRT (P < .001) over 14 days from start of the study.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Critically ill mechanically ventilated patients who were assigned randomly to more-intensive RRT had longer duration of mechanical ventilation compared with those who were assigned to less-intensive RRT. The reasons for this, such as excessive phosphate loss from more-intensive RRT, deserve further study to optimize the safety and effectiveness of CRRT delivery. This was a post hoc analysis of the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network study; clinical trial registration of the original trial is NCT00076219."
The degree of aortic occlusion in the setting of trauma alters the extent of acute kidney injury associated with mitochondrial preservation.,"Biebele Abel, John Mares, Justin Hutzler, Babita Parajuli, Lalitha Kurada, Joseph M White, Brandon W Propper, Ian J Stewart, David M Burmeister, Biebele Abelet al.",2024 Apr 1,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38450433/,"acute kidney injury, inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, mitochondria, swine.","Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is used to control noncompressible hemorrhage not addressed with traditional tourniquets. However, REBOA is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and subsequent mortality in severely injured trauma patients. Here, we investigated how the degree of aortic occlusion altered the extent of AKI in a porcine model. Female Yorkshire-cross swine (n = 16, 68.1 ± 0.7 kg) were anesthetized and had carotid and bilateral femoral arteries accessed for REBOA insertion and distal and proximal blood pressure monitoring. Through a laparotomy, a 6-cm liver laceration was performed and balloon inflation was performed in zone 1 of the aorta for 90 min, during which animals were randomized to target distal mean arterial pressures of 25 or 45 mmHg via balloon volume adjustment. Blood draws were taken at baseline, end of occlusion, and time of death, at which point renal tissues were harvested 6 h after balloon deflation for histological and molecular analyses. Renal blood flow was lower in the 25-mmHg group (48.5 ± 18.3 mL/min) than in the 45-mmHg group (177.9 ± 27.2 mL/min) during the occlusion phase, which recovered and was not different after balloon deflation. AKI was more severe in the 25-mmHg group, as evidenced by circulating creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. The 25-mmHg group had increased tubular necrosis, lower renal citrate synthase activity, increased tissue and circulating syndecan-1, and elevated systemic inflammatory cytokines. The extent of renal ischemia-induced AKI is associated with the magnitude of mitochondrial biomass and systemic inflammation, highlighting potential mechanistic targets to combine with partial REBOA strategies to prevent AKI.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Large animal models of ischemia-reperfusion acute kidney injury (IR-AKI) are lacking. This report establishes a titratable IR-AKI model in swine in which a balloon catheter can be used to alter distal pressures experienced by the kidney, thus controlling renal blood flow. Lower blood flow results in greater renal dysfunction and structural damage, as well as lower mitochondrial biomass, elevated systemic inflammation, and vascular dysfunction."
Renal Safety of Multimodal Brain Imaging Followed by Endovascular Therapy.,"Carlo W Cereda, Michael Mlynash, Pietro E Cippà, Stephanie Kemp, Jeremy J Heit, Michael P Marks, Maarten G Lansberg, Gregory W Albers, Carlo W Ceredaet al.",2021 Jan,Stroke,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33250038/,No keywords found,"Background and purpose:
        
      
      Contrast-enhanced noninvasive angiography and perfusion imaging are recommended to identify eligible patients for endovascular therapy (EVT) in extended time windows (>6 hours or wake-up). If eligible, additional intraarterial contrast exposure will occur during EVT. We aimed to study the renal safety in the DEFUSE 3 (Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke) population, selected with contrast-enhanced multimodal Imaging and randomized to EVT versus medical management.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In the randomized DEFUSE 3 trial population, we compared changes in serum creatinine between baseline (before randomization) and 24 hours later. The primary outcome was the relative change in creatinine level between baseline and 24 hours in the EVT versus medical arm. The secondary outcome was a comparison between computed tomography (CT) versus magnetic resonance imaging selection in the EVT arm. The safety outcome was a comparison of the proportion of patients with criteria for contrast-associated kidney injury in the EVT versus medical arm and a comparison between CT versus magnetic resonance imaging selection in the EVT arm.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the DEFUSE 3 population (n=182, age 69±13, 51% female), mean creatinine decreased from a baseline of 0.98±0.33 mg/dL to 0.88±0.28 mg/dL at 24 hours (P<0.001). There was no difference in change between treatment groups: relative to baseline, there was a 6.3% reduction in the EVT group versus 9.2% in the medical group, P=0.294. Absolute decrease -0.08±0.18 in EVT versus -0.12±0.18 in medical, P=0.135; Among patients treated with EVT, there was no difference in 24-hour creatinine level changes between patients who were selected with CT angiography/CT perfusion (-0.08±0.18) versus magnetic resonance imaging (-0.07±0.19), P=0.808 or 6.8% reduction versus 4.8%, P=0.696. In the EVT arm, contrast-associated kidney injury was encountered in 4 out of 91 (4.4%) versus 2/90 (2.2%) in the medical arm P=0.682. In the EVT arm, contrast-associated kidney injury was evenly distributed between magnetic resonance imaging (1/22, 4.6%) versus CT 3 out of 69 (4.4%), P=1.0.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Perfusion imaging before EVT was not associated with evidence of decline in renal function. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02586415."

A large body of evidence supports that AKI is related to volume of contrast used. Despite several measures are available to reduce the impact of contrast media on AKI, its incidence remains significant as other mechanisms of renal damage are involved. A new paradigm is established according to which bleeding prevention is at least as important as preventing recurrent ischemic events in the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing an invasive approach. Periprocedural bleeding, which is consistently reduced by radial approach, is emerging as a risk factor for the development of AKI. Therefore, the role of vascular access as a measure to prevent AKI needs to be systematically assessed in randomized studies. To date, no prospective comparison on renal outcomes has been carried out in randomized trials between radial and femoral approach. The Minimizing Adverse hemorrhagic events by TRansradial access site and systemic Implementation of AngioX (MATRIX) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01433627) has been designed to test whether to minimize bleeding events by using radial access and bivalirudin, across the whole spectrum of patients with ACS undergoing PCI, will result in improved outcomes with respect to both ischemic and bleeding complications. The AKI-MATRIX sub-study will provide a unique opportunity to assess whether the advantages of radial approach may even contribute to the reduction of the risk of AKI in patients with ACS."
Five-Year Follow-Up of Patients With Radio-Contrast-Induced Acute Renal Injury: Can Intravenous Sodium Bicarbonate Improve Long-Term Outcomes?,"Fernando Boccalandro, Katherine Shreyder, Laura Harmon, Mandeep Dhindsa, Tallat Fahim, Samia Sheikh, Fernando Boccalandroet al.",2021 Oct:31:61-68.,Cardiovasc Revasc Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33250404/,No keywords found,"Background/purpose:
        
      
      Radiocontrast-induced acute kidney injury (RAKI) is a frequent complication during angiography and is associated with adverse prognosis. Most of the studies evaluating the long-term outcome of patients with RAKI are based on institutional registries. This is the first prospective study to evaluate the 5-year outcomes of patients with RAKI, and assess the effect of sodium bicarbonate (SB) in the long-term outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing non-emergent coronary angiography.
    


          Materials/methods:
        
      
      382 CKD stage III-IV patients undergoing elective non-emergent coronary angiography were randomized to SB (n = 192) or normal saline (NS) solution (n = 190). Incidence of RAKI, in-hospital, 1- and 5-year mortality and renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 5-year major adverse renal and cardiovascular events (MARCE) were compared between groups. Outcomes of patient with and without RAKI were compared after five-years of prospective follow-up. Multivariate predictors of RAKI and death at 5-years were determined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The use of SB did not improve the incidence of RAKI, in-hospital outcomes, survival, and freedom from RRT or MARCE after 5-years of follow-up. Patients that developed RAKI had a significantly higher mortality at 1-year [8.9% Vs. 1.2%] and 5-years (36% Vs. 11%) (P < 0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Hydration with SB showed no benefit compared to NS in preventing RAKI. The use of SB was not superior to NS after 5-years of follow-up regarding MARCE, survival or freedom of RRT. Five-year mortality among patients who developed RAKI remains high, and further research is needed to find the best preventive strategy for this high-risk group of patients.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Radiocontrast-induced acute-kidney-injury (RAKI) is associated with poor long-term outcomes in observational and short-term studies. Hydration with sodium bicarbonate (SB) had been evaluated in the prevention of RAKI; but its long-term effect has not been evaluated. We randomized 382 high high-risk patients undergoing coronary angiography to SB or normal saline following them for five years. SB showed no benefit in preventing RAKI, decreasing major adverse renal and cardiovascular events, improving survival or freedom from dialysis after 5-years. This is the first study to follow patients with RAKI for a period of 5-years, showing a significantly higher mortality in this group of patients."
Effect of Ascorbic Acid on Cardiac Surgery-Associated Acute Kidney Injury Incidence.,"Anze Djordjevic, Stamenko Susak, Petra Kotnik, Mario Gorenjak, Zeljko Knez, Miha Antonic, Anze Djordjevicet al.",2022 Oct,Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35643076/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with higher perioperative mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress has been proposed as a cause of postoperative AKI. Ascorbic acid (AA) supplementation was suggested as a novel and promising antioxidant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of AA to reduce the incidence of postoperative AKI in cardiac surgery patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective randomized trial was conducted in patients scheduled for on-pump cardiac surgery. Subjects in the AA group received 2 g of AA intravenously during the induction of anesthesia, 2 g before aortic cross-clamp removal and 1 g every 8 hours for five postoperative days (the JERICA protocol). Postoperatively, the patients were monitored for AKI and other complications. Malondialdehyde levels were monitored in a subpopulation of 100 patients to evaluate the effect of AA on oxidative stress level.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The AA and control group consisted of 163 and 169 patients, respectively. The groups were well matched for baseline demographics and had similar intraoperative characteristics. The incidence of AKI in the AA and control group was 20.9 and 28.4%, respectively (p = 0.127). The estimated glomerular filtration rate did not differ between the study groups in the entire postoperative period. There was a trend toward higher malondialdehyde values with statistical significance on postoperative day 1 and lower in-hospital mortality in the AA group (0.6 vs. 4.1%, p = 0.067).

          Methods:
        
      
      We measured plasma nucleosome levels using the Cell Death Detection ELISA PLUS (10X) assay kit. We analysed plasma levels for correlation with disease severity and compared the effects of CVVH-HCO and CVVH-std on plasma nucleosome levels over the first 72 hours. We studied cell surface TLR expression on CD14-positive monocytes in a subcohort of CVVH-HCO patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We did not detect nucleosomes in normal human plasma, but found elevated nucleosome levels in patients with severe AKI. Nucleosome levels at randomisation correlated weakly with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III scores (Pearson ρ=0.475, P=0.016). Treatment with CVVH-HCO or CVVH-std had no effect on nucleosome levels over 72 hours. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratios of TLR2 and TLR4 expression were elevated throughout the 72-hour period (range for TLR2, 0.97-3.98; range for TLR4, 0.91-10.18) and did not appear to decrease as a result of treatment with CVVH-HCO.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Nucleosome concentration was elevated in the plasma of patients with severe AKI and mildly correlated with disease severity, but was not affected by treatment with CVVH-HCO or CVVH-std. Similarly, levels of TLR2 and TLR4 expression did not decrease over time during CVVHCrit HCO treatment."
Risk Factors for Long-Term Mortality and Progressive Chronic Kidney Disease Associated With Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery.,"Jia-Rui Xu, Jia-Ming Zhu, Jun Jiang, Xiao-Qiang Ding, Yi Fang, Bo Shen, Zhong-Hua Liu, Jian-Zhou Zou, Lan Liu, Chun-Sheng Wang, Claudio Ronco, Hong Liu, Jie Teng, Jia-Rui Xuet al.",2015 Nov,Medicine (Baltimore),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26559305/,No keywords found,"The aim of the study was to evaluate risk factors for long-term mortality and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) after cardiac surgery in patients with normal preoperative renal function and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). From April 2009 to December 2012, we prospectively enrolled 3245 cardiac surgery patients of our hospital. The primary endpoints included survival rates and the secondary endpoint was the incidence of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a follow-up period of 2 years. Acute kidney injury was staged by KDIGO classification. Progressive CKD was defined as GFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (starting renal replacement therapy or renal transplantation).The AKI incidence was 39.9% (n = 1295). The 1 and 2 year overall survival (OS) rates of AKI patients were significantly lower than that for non-AKI patients (85.9% and 82.3% vs 98.1% and 93.7%, P < 0.001), even after complete recovery of renal function during 2 years after intervention (P < 0.001). The 2-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with AKI stage 1, 2, and 3 were 89.9%, 78.6%, and 61.4% (P < 0.001), respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis of factors for 2-year survival rates revealed that besides age (P < 0.001), chronic cardiac failure (P < 0.001), diabetes (P < 0.001), cardiopulmonary bypass time (P < 0.01), and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (P = 0.004), AKI was a significant risk factor for reducing 2-year survival rates even after complete recovery of renal function (P < 0.001). The accumulated progressive CKD prevalence was significantly higher in AKI than in non-AKI patients (6.8% vs 0.2%, P < 0.001) in the 2 years after surgery. Even with complete recovery of renal function at discharge, AKI was still a risk factor for accumulated progressive CKD (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.37-2.69).The 2-year mortality and progressive CKD incidence even after complete recovery of renal function were significantly increased in cardiac surgery patients with postoperative AKI."
Effect of Chronic Kidney Disease on Cardiovascular Events: An Epidemiological Aspect from SPRINT Trial.,"Armin Attar, Mehrab Sayadi, Armin Attaret al.",2019 Sep,Iran J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31705750/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Currently, conflicting evidence exists among community-based studies as to whether Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a Cardiovascular (CVD) risk equivalent. We aimed to evaluate the effect of CKD on CVD based on large trial results.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To perform a secondary analysis, we obtained the data of SPRINT trial from NHLBI Data Repository Center. 2646 subjects with baseline CKD and 6715 without CKD were enrolled. A composite of myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes was considered as primary outcome.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Throughout the 3.21 years of follow-up, presence of CKD, compared to those without CKD, negatively affected the primary outcome (incidence rate, 2.84% per year vs. 1.55% per year in patients with and without CKD, respectively; Hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.49 to 2.11; P<0.001). This finding was consistent across all the secondary outcomes. However, the risk was not as great as those with clinical cardiovascular disease (incidence rate, 4.13% per year). Presence of CKD was the strongest predictor of developing AKI with intensive blood pressure reduction, increasing its chance by 215%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      SPRINT is the first trial revealing that CKD is an independent risk factor for CVD. However, CKD could not be considered as a CVD risk equivalent. In the presence of CKD, with intensive blood pressure reduction the chance of AKI is dramatically increased."

      Colistin is a lipopeptide antibiotic administered as an inactive prodrug-colistin methanesulfonate (CMS). Colistin is a drug with a narrow therapeutic window; the limiting factors are mainly nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, dependent on plasma concentrations. The number of patients with infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria sensitive only to colistin and the number of patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for severe respiratory failure increased significantly in association with COVID-19-induced infections. ECMO can generally affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs by creating a new compartment.

      The COL-ECMO2022 study is a prospective, non-randomised, single-centre, phase IV pharmacokinetic clinical trial designed to assess the influence of ECMO on the pharmacokinetics of colistin and CMS. Up to 30 patients treated with colistin will be included in the study and assigned to one of two arms, depending on the presence/absence of ECMO. All study participants will receive standard CMS dose intravenously. The plasma concentrations of colistin and CMS taken at defined intervals will be assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Patients will participate in the clinical trial for a maximum of three monitored dosing intervals. A population pharmacokinetic model will be developed to assess the influence of ECMO on pharmacokinetics. A difference greater than 25% is considered clinically significant.

Automated Electronic Alert for the Care and Outcomes of Adults With Acute Kidney Injury: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Ting Li, Buyun Wu, Li Li, Ao Bian, Juan Ni, Kang Liu, Zhongke Qin, Yudie Peng, Yining Shen, Mengru Lv, Xinyi Lu, Changying Xing, Huijuan Mao, Ting Liet al.",2024 Jan 2,JAMA Netw Open,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38241047/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Despite the expansion of published electronic alerts for acute kidney injury (AKI), there are still concerns regarding their effect on the clinical outcomes of patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the effect of the AKI alert combined with a care bundle on the care and clinical outcomes of patients with hospital-acquired AKI.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This single-center, double-blind, parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Nanjing, China, from August 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021. The inclusion criteria were inpatient adults aged 18 years or older with AKI, which was defined using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either the alert group or the usual care group, which were stratified by medical vs surgical ward and by intensive care unit (ICU) vs non-ICU setting. Analyses were conducted on the modified intention-to-treat population.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      A programmatic AKI alert system generated randomization automatically and sent messages to the mobile telephones of clinicians (alert group) or did not send messages (usual care group). A care bundle accompanied the AKI alert and consisted of general, nonindividualized, and nonmandatory AKI management measures.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was maximum change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) within 7 days after randomization. Secondary patient-centered outcomes included death, dialysis, AKI progression, and AKI recovery. Care-centered outcomes included diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 2208 patients (median [IQR] age, 65 [54-72] years; 1560 males [70.7%]) were randomized to the alert group (n = 1123) or the usual care group (n = 1085) and analyzed. Within 7 days of randomization, median (IQR) maximum absolute changes in eGFR were 3.7 (-6.4 to 19.3) mL/min/1.73 m2 in the alert group and 2.9 (-9.2 to 16.9) mL/min/1.73 m2 in the usual care group (P = .24). This result was robust in all subgroups in an exploratory analysis. For care-centered outcomes, patients in the alert group had more intravenous fluids (927 [82.6%] vs 670 [61.8%]; P < .001), less exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (56 [5.0%] vs 119 [11.0%]; P < .001), and more AKI documentation at discharge (560 [49.9%] vs 296 [27.3%]; P < .001) than patients in the usual care group. No differences were observed in patient-centered secondary outcomes between the 2 groups.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Results of this randomized clinical trial showed that the electronic AKI alert did not improve kidney function or other patient-centered outcomes but changed patient care behaviors. The findings warrant the use of a combination of high-quality interventions and AKI alert in future clinical practice.

The furosemide stress test predicts the timing of continuous renal replacement therapy initiation in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: a double-blind prospective intervention cohort study.,"Kun Zhang, Haohua Zhang, Chai Zhao, Zhenjie Hu, Jiuyan Shang, Yuhong Chen, Yan Huo, Congcong Zhao, Bin Li, Suzhi Guo                              ;, Hebei Key Laboratory of Critical Disease Mechanism and Intervention, Kun Zhanget al.",2023 Apr 5,Eur J Med Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020287/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) remains a crucial treatment for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), although the timing of its initiation is still a matter of contention. Furosemide stress testing (FST) may be a practical and beneficial prediction instrument. This research was meant to examine if FST can be used to identify high-risk patients for CRRT.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study is a double-blind, prospective interventional cohort study. For patients with AKI receiving intensive care unit (ICU) income, FST was selected with furosemide 1 mg/kg intravenous (1.5 mg/kg intravenous if a loop diuretic was received within 7 days). Urinary volume more than 200 ml at 2 h after FST was FST-responsive, less than 200 ml was FST-nonresponsive. The FST results are kept strictly confidential from the clinician, who decides whether to initiate CRRT based on laboratory testing and clinical symptoms other than the FST data. The FST data are concealed from both the patients and the clinician.
    


          Results:
        
      
      FST was delivered to 187 of 241 patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with 48 patients responding to the test and 139 patients not responding. 18/48 (37.5%) of the FST-responsive patients received CRRT, while 124/139 (89.2%) of the FST-nonresponsive patients received CRRT. There was no significant difference between the CRRT and non-CRRT groups in terms of general health and medical history (P > 0.05). Urine volume after 2 h of FST was considerably lower in the CRRT group than in the non-CRRT group (35 ml, IQR5-143.75 versus 400 ml, IQR210-890; P = 0.000). FST non-responders were 2.379 times more likely to initiate CRRT than FST responders (95% CI 1.644-3.443, P = 0.000). The area under the curve (AUC) for initiating CRRT was 0.966 (cutoff of 156 ml, sensitivity of 94.85%, specificity of 98.04%, P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study demonstrated that FST is a safe and practical approach for predicting the initiation of CRRT in critically ill AKI patients. Trial registration www.chictr.org.cn , ChiCTR1800015734, Registered 17 April 2018."
Assessment of pN-GAL as a marker of renal function in elite cyclists during professional competitions.,"A Andreazzoli, C Fossati, A Spaccamiglio, R Salvo, F Quaranta, C Minganti, L Di Luigi, P Borrione, A Andreazzoliet al.",2017 Jul-Sep,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28958144/,No keywords found,"Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been shown to be lower than physiological values during exercise with a strong negative correlation with exercise intensity. Among new markers of renal function, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) seems to be very promising. It is an early, sensitive and specific marker of acute kidney injury (AKI) with two isoforms: plasma NGAL (pNGAL) and urinary NGAL (uNGAL). The aim of the present study was to assess acute variations in NGAL plasma levels after performing high endurance physical exercise in a group of professional cyclists during the two major European professional cycling competitions (Giro D’Italia and Tour de France). Eighteen professional cyclistis were recruited for the study. A blood sample was collected during rest (after 8 hours fasting) and immediately after the competition (mountain stages) in order to assess the effect of very intense exercise on kidney function by measuring the variations of pNGAL. We also assessed plasma levels of creatinine, creatine-kinase (CK), LDH, transaminases and electrolytes. The results showed that Creatinine, CK and electrolytes levels remained almost stable between rest and post-competition. The levels of transaminases and NGAL showed a mild increase between rest and post-competition, with a significant difference between the two values only for transaminases (p=0.005). However, post-competition values of all investigated variables remained within the physiological range. The results of the present study suggest that even if NGAL values mildly rose after competition, no kidney injury occurred in these highly trained athletes during mountain stages of professional competitions. Other studies in literature confirmed that high endurance physical exercise seems not to cause renal injury in elite athletes. This is probably due to adaptive mechanisms of renal function and to the adaptation to physical stress gained with training."
Miniaturized versus conventional cardiopulmonary bypass and acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery.,"S T H Chew, R R G Ng, W Liu, S G Goh, M G Caleb, L K Ti, S T H Chewet al.",2016 Jan,Perfusion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25910838/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). There are conflicting reports whether a miniaturized cardiopulmonary bypass (MCPB) system is associated with a lower AKI incidence compared with conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CCPB). It is unknown if AKI risk factors differ between the two groups. We assessed if MCPB decreases AKI after CABG and compared the risk factors between both groups.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixty-eight Asian patients presenting for elective CABG at a tertiary heart centre were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to MCPB (n=34) or CCPB group (n=34) and followed up in a single-blinded, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. The primary outcome was Acute Kidney Injury Network stage 1 AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The AKI incidence was 21.5% and was not significantly different between patients undergoing MCPB versus CCPB (21.9% versus 21.2%, p=0.948). The first CPB haematocrit was independently associated with AKI in the MCPB group (Relative Risk [RR]=0.484, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=0.268-0.876, p=0.016); post-operative blood loss and inflammation were independently associated with AKI in the CCPB group (RR=1.005, 95%CI=1.003-1.007, p<0.001; RR=1.018, 95%CI=1.010-1.028, p<0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The MCPB system is not associated with a lower incidence of AKI in Asian patients undergoing CABG. Risk factors for AKI differed between patients using the MCPB and CCPB systems."
Comparison of filter life span and solute removal during continuous renal replacement therapy: convection versus diffusion - A randomized controlled trial.,"Qiancheng Xu, Bo Jiang, Juan Li, Weihua Lu, Jianguo Li, Qiancheng Xuet al.",2022 Oct,Ther Apher Dial,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967496/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study aimed to investigate whether continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) has a different filter life span and molecular solutes clearance when compared to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixty patients were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to the CVVHDF (n = 30) or CVVH (n = 30) groups. Demographics, laboratory tests, urea, creatinine, IL-6, β2-microglobulin, and myoglobulin clearance were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients in the CVVH group had a shorter median time of filter life span compared with those in the CVVHDF group (20 vs. 37.5 h, p = 0.002). Urea and creatinine clearance were not significantly different between groups over time (p > 0.05). IL-6, β2-microglobulin, and myoglobulin clearance were higher in the CVVH group. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) was significantly higher in the CVVH group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The use of CVVHDF may lead to a longer filter life span and lower clearance of medium and large molecules without affecting the small molecular solute clearance.

Growth differentiation factor-15 levels and the risk of contrast induced acute kidney injury in acute myocardial infarction patients treated invasively: A propensity-score match analysis.,"Ling Sun, Xuejun Zhou, Jianguang Jiang, Xuan Zang, Xin Chen, Haiyan Li, Haitao Cao, Qingjie Wang, Ling Sunet al.",2018 Mar 12,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29529072/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is an emerging biomarker for risk stratification in cardiovascular disease. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this retrospectively observational study, we aimed to determine the role of GDF-15 and the risk of AKI in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The medical records of 1195 patients with AMI were reviewed. After exclusion criteria, a total of 751 eligible patients who underwent CAG or PCI were studied. Preoperative clinical parameters including GDF-15 levels were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors of AKI. Subsequently, to reduce a potential selection bias and to balance differences between the two groups, a propensity score-matched analysis was performed. We recorded the 30-day all-cause mortality of the total study population. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to identify the association between short term survival in AMI patients and GDF-15 level.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 751 enrolled patients, 106 patients (14.1%) developed AKI. Patients were divided into two groups: AKI group (n = 106) and non-AKI group (n = 645). GDF-15 levels were significantly higher in AKI group compared to non-AKI group (1328.2 ± 349.7 ng/L vs. 1113.0 ± 371.3 ng/L, P <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed GDF-15 was an independent risk factor of AKI (per 1000 ng/L increase of GDF-15, OR: 3.740, 95% CI: 1.940-7.207, P < 0.001). According to GDF-15 tertiles, patients were divided into three groups. Patients in middle (OR 2.93, 95% CI: 1.46-5.89, P = 0.003) and highest GDF-15 tertile (OR 3.72, 95% CI: 1.87-7.39, P <0.001) had higher risk of AKI compared to patients in the lowest GDF-15 tertile. The propensity score-matched group set comprised of 212 patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that GDF-15 is still an independent risk factor for AKI after matching (per 1000 ng/L increase of GDF-15, OR: 2.395, 95% CI: 1.020-5.626, P = 0.045). Based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the risk of 30-day all-cause mortality increased in higher GDF-15 tertiles log rank chi-square: 29.895, P <0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This suggests that preoperative plasma GDF-15 is an independent risk factor of AKI in AMI patients underwent CAG or PCI. GDF-15 and AKI are associated with poor short term survival of AMI patients."
Comprehensive biomarker assessment for predicting severe acute kidney injury and need of kidney replacement therapy in liver transplantation patients.,"Camila Lima, Gillene Santos Ferreira, Maria de Fátima Fernandes Vattimo, Luciana Bertocco de Paiva Haddad, Luiz Marcelo Malbouisson, Luiz Augusto Carneiro D'Albuquerque, Alexandre Toledo Maciel, Etienne Macedo, Camila Limaet al.",2024 Dec,Ren Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39287102/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Renal dysfunction is a common complication following liver transplantation (LT). This study aimed to determine whether a comprehensive assessment of kidney function using nineteen serum and urinary biomarkers (BMs) within the first 48 h post-LT could enhance the prediction of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and the need of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) during the first postoperative week.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Blood and urine (U) samples were collected during the pre- and postoperative periods. Nineteen BMs were evaluated to assess kidney health in the first 48 h after LT. Classification and regression tree (CART) cross-validation identified key predictors to determine the best BM combination for predicting outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 100 LT patients, 36 developed severe AKI, and 34 required KRT within the first postoperative week. Preoperative assessment of U neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) predicted the need for KRT with 75% accuracy. The combined assessment of U osmolality (OSM), U kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) within 48 h post-LT predicted severe AKI with 80% accuracy. U-OSM alone, measured within 48 h post-LT, had an accuracy of 83% for predicting KRT need, outperforming any BM combination.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Combined BM analysis can accurately predict severe AKI and KRT needs in the perioperative period of LT. U-OSM alone proved to be an effective tool for monitoring the risk of severe AKI, available in most centers. Further studies are needed to assess its impact on AKI progression postoperatively.Registered at Clinical Trials (clinicaltrials.gov) in March 24th, 2014 by title 'Acute Kidney Injury Biomarkers: Diagnosis and Application in Pre-operative Period of Liver Transplantation (AKIB)' and identifier NCT02095431."

      Sepsis and septic shock occur commonly in severe burns. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is also common and often results as a consequence of sepsis. Mortality is unacceptably high in burn patients who develop AKI requiring renal replacement therapy and is presumed to be even higher when combined with septic shock. We hypothesized that high-volume hemofiltration (HVHF) as a blood purification technique would be beneficial in this population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of HVHF on the hemodynamic profile of burn patients with septic shock and AKI involving seven burn centers in the United States. Subjects randomized to the HVHF were prescribed a dose of 70 ml/kg/hour for 48 hours while control subjects were managed in standard fashion in accordance with local practices.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During a 4-year period, a total of nine subjects were enrolled for the intervention during the ramp-in phase and 28 subjects were randomized, 14 each into the control and HVHF arms respectively. The study was terminated due to slow enrollment. Ramp-in subjects were included along with those randomized in the final analysis. Our primary endpoint, the vasopressor dependency index, decreased significantly at 48 hours compared to baseline in the HVHF group (p = 0.007) while it remained no different in the control arm. At 14 days, the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome score decreased significantly in the HVHF group when compared to the day of treatment initiation (p = 0.02). No changes in inflammatory markers were detected during the 48-hour intervention period. No significant difference in survival was detected. No differences in adverse events were noted between the groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      HVHF was effective in reversing shock and improving organ function in burn patients with septic shock and AKI, and appears safe. Whether reversal of shock in these patients can improve survival is yet to be determined.

Analysis of Leukocyte Recruitment in Continuous Veno-Venous Hemofiltration with Regional Citrate vs. Systemic Heparin Anticoagulation.,"Andreas Margraf, Chang Liu, Mira Küllmar, Melanie Meersch, Jan Rossaint, Alexander Zarbock, Andreas Margrafet al.",2022 Jun 1,Cells,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35681510/,"CVVH, acute kidney injury, anticoagulation, citrate, heparin, inflammation, leukocytes.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients. Supportive treatment of AKI patients is based on renal-replacement therapy, including continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). To limit clotting events on extracorporeal surfaces, anticoagulants are administered, including systemic heparin and local citrate. The differential and comparative effects of these anticoagulants on leukocyte function in acute kidney injury patients are, so far, insufficiently understood. In this bio-add-on-study, AKI patients were randomized as part of a parallel-group trial to either systemic heparin or regional citrate anticoagulation. Patient samples were collected upon inclusion, prior to CVVH initiation at day 0, day 1, day 3 and day 5, following CVVH initiation, and one day after cessation of CVVH, then immediately analyzed. Flow cytometric assessment of surface-receptor molecules was conducted. Whole-blood-perfused human microfluidic chambers were used for the analysis of neutrophil rolling and adhesion. Acute kidney injury was associated with significant changes in the surface expression of CD182 and CD16 throughout CVVH treatment, independent of the anticoagulation regime. AKI furthermore abrogated selectin-induced slow leukocyte rolling and diminished chemokine-induced leukocyte arrest. Subgroup analyses of citrate vs. heparin treatment showed no significant differences between groups, independent of the duration of CVVH treatment. CD182 and CD16 expression remained low in both groups throughout CVVH therapy. These data confirm that AKI impairs selectin-mediated leukocyte slow rolling and chemokine-induced leukocyte arrest in vitro. Systemic heparin or local citrate anticoagulation have no differential effect on the leukocyte recruitment steps examined in this study."
Construction and evaluation of a risk prediction model for pulmonary infection-associated acute kidney injury in intensive care units.,"Xinyi Cao, Yongzhi Liang, Honglin Feng, Li Chen, Shengming Liu, Xinyi Caoet al.",2023 Oct,Clin Transl Sci,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37488744/,No keywords found,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the common complications of pulmonary infections. However, nomograms predicting the risk of early-onset AKI in patients with pulmonary infections have not been comprehensively researched. In this study, 3278 patients with pulmonary infection were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. These patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts, with the training cohort used for model building and the validation cohort used for validation. Independent risk factors for patients with pulmonary infection were determined using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and forward stepwise logistic regression, which revealed that 11 independent risk factors for AKI in patients with pulmonary infections were congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, diabetes, transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2), 24-h urine output, white blood cells (WBC), serum creatinine (Scr), prothrombin time (PT), potential of hydrogen (PH), vasopressor use, and mechanical ventilation (MV) use. The nomogram was then constructed and validated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of the nomogram were 0.770 (95% CI = 0.789-0.807) in the training cohort and 0.724 (95% CI = 0.754-0.784) in the validation cohort. High AUC values indicated the good discriminative ability of the nomogram, while the calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow test results indicated that the nomogram was well-calibrated. Improvements in net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) values indicate that our nomogram was superior to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II scoring system, and the decision-curve analysis (DCA) curves indicate that the nomogram has good clinical application. We established a risk-prediction model for AKI in patients with pulmonary infection, which has good discriminative power and is superior to the SAPS II scoring system. This model can provide clinical reference information for patients with this type of disease in the intensive care unit."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in patients under mechanical ventilation (MV). We aimed to assess the risk factors for AKI with particular emphasis on those potentially preventable.
    


          Study design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Retrospective analysis of a large, multinational database of MV patients with >24 h of MV and normal renal function at admission. AKI was defined according to creatinine-based KDIGO criteria. Risk factors were analyzed according to the time point at which AKI occurred: early (≤48 h after ICU admission, AKIE) and late (day 3 to day 7 of ICU stay, AKIL). A conditional logistic regression model was used to identify variables independently associated with AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Three thousand two hundred six patients were included. Seven hundred patients had AKI (22%), the majority of them AKIE (547/704). The risk factor profile was highly dependent upon the timing of AKI onset. In AKIE risk factors were older age; SAPS II score; postoperative and cardiac arrest as the reasons for MV; worse cardiovascular SOFA, pH, serum creatinine, and platelet count; higher level of peak pressure and Vt/kg; and fluid overload at admission. In contrast, AKIL was linked mostly to events that occurred after admission (lower platelet count and pH; ICU-acquired sepsis; and fluid overload). None ventilation-associated parameters were identify as risk factors for AKIL.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In the first 48 h, risk factors are associated with the primary disease and the patient's condition at admission. Subsequently, emergent events like sepsis and organ dysfunction appear to be predictive factors making prevention a challenge."
"Rationale and Design of NEUTRALIZE-AKI: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Pivotal Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of a Selective Cytopheretic Device in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury Requiring Continuous Kidney Replacement Therapy.","Lenar Yessayan, H David Humes, Emily C Scribe, Sai Prasad N Iyer, Kevin K Chung, Lenar Yessayanet al.",2024,Nephron,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37442112/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      NEUTRALIZE-AKI is a pivotal study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the selective cytopheretic device (SCD) in adult patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT).
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      This is a two-arm, randomized, open-label, controlled multi-center pivotal US study which will enroll 200 adult patients (age 18-80 years) in the intensive care unit with acute kidney injury requiring CKRT and at least one additional organ failure across 30 clinical centers. Eligible patients will be randomized to CKRT plus SCD therapy versus CKRT alone. Therapy will be administered for up to 10 days, with the hypothesis that the CKRT plus SCD group will demonstrate a lower mortality rate or better rate of renal recovery than the CKRT alone group by day 90. The primary outcome is a composite of dialysis dependence or all-cause mortality at day 90.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The SCD is a cell-directed extracorporeal therapy that targets and deactivates pro-inflammatory neutrophils and monocytes, with evidence of efficacy across a variety of critically ill patient populations. Knowledge and experience from many of those studies and other AKI trials were incorporated into the design of this pivotal study, with the aim to investigate the role of effector cell immunomodulation in the intervention of AKI."
Impact of previous REnal TRansplantation on the mid-term renal Outcome after CARdiac surgery: the RETROCAR trial.,"Antoine Beurton, Antoine Fajardie, Sebastien Rubin, Pierre Belnou, Clement Aguerreche, Mathieu Pernot, Stefano Mion, Julien Imbault, Alexandre Ouattara, Antoine Beurtonet al.",2023 Feb 13,Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36099910/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complications after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Renal transplant recipients (RTRs) have a higher risk of cardiac surgery-associated AKI (CSA-AKI). A relationship has been strongly suggested between AKI and poor long-term graft survival. The main objective was to evaluate the impact of on-pump cardiac surgery on the 1-year renal allograft survival rate.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study population consisted of 37 RTRs and 56 non-RTRs who underwent cardiac surgery between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019. They were matched according to age, sex, preoperative glomerular function, diabetes and type of surgery. The primary composite outcome was renal survival, defined as patient survival without the requirement for permanent dialysis or new kidney transplantation at 1 year after surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The renal survival rate was significantly lower in the RTR group than in the non-RTR group [81% versus 96%; odds ratio 0.16 (95% confidence interval 0.03-0.82), P = .03]. The proportion of patients who returned to permanent dialysis was higher in the RTR group than in the non-RTR group (12% versus 0%; P = .02). The proportion of patients with severe AKI was also higher in the RTR group. At 1 year after surgery, serum creatinine level, glomerular filtration rate and all-cause mortality rates were comparable between both groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Patients with a functional renal allograft have a low 1-year renal allograft survival rate after cardiac surgery with CPB. In addition, these patients have significant risks of AKI and acute kidney disease after open-heart surgery."
Prospective model for predicting renal recovery in cardiac surgery patients with acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy.,"Penghua Hu, Li Song, Huaban Liang, Yuanhan Chen, Yanhua Wu, Li Zhang, Zhilian Li, Lei Fu, Yiming Tao, Shuangxin Liu, Zhiming Ye, Xia Fu, Xinling Liang, Penghua Huet al.",2021 Jul,Nephrology (Carlton),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33742730/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      To develop a model for predicting renal recovery in cardiac surgery patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from a prospective randomized controlled trial, conducted in a tertiary hospital to compare the survival effect of two dosages of hemofiltration for continuous RRT in cardiac surgery patients between 20 March 2012 and 9 August 2015, were used to develop the model. The outcome was renal recovery defined as alive and dialysis-free 90 days after RRT initiation. Multivariate logistic regression with a stepwise backward selection of variables based on Akaike Information Criterion was applied to develop the model, which was internally validated using bootstrapping. Model discrimination, calibration and clinical value were assessed using the concordance index (C-Index), calibration plots and decision curve analysis, respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Totally, 211 patients with AKI requiring RRT (66.8% male) with median age of 57 years were included. The incidence of renal recovery was 33.2% (n = 70). The model included six variables: body mass index stratification, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, sepsis, mean arterial pressure and mechanical ventilation. The C-Index for this model was 0.807 (95% CI, 0.744-0.870). After correction by the bootstrap, the C-Index was 0.780 (95% CI, 0.720-0.845). The calibration plots indicated good consistency between actual observations and model prediction of renal recovery. Decision curve analysis demonstrated the model was clinical usefulness.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We developed and validated a model to predict the chance of renal recovery in cardiac surgery patients with AKI requiring RRT."
Electrolyte and mineral disturbances in septic acute kidney injury patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy.,"Su-Young Jung, Hyunwook Kim, Seohyun Park, Jong Hyun Jhee, Hae-Ryong Yun, Hyoungnae Kim, Youn Kyung Kee, Chang-Yun Yoon, Hyung Jung Oh, Tae Ik Chang, Jung Tak Park, Tae-Hyun Yoo, Shin-Wook Kang, Hajeong Lee, Dong Ki Kim, Seung Hyeok Han, Su-Young Junget al.",2016 Sep,Medicine (Baltimore),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27603344/,No keywords found,"Electrolyte and mineral disturbances remain a major concern in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT); however, it is not clear whether those imbalances are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with septic acute kidney injury (AKI) undergoing CRRT. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of data from a prospective randomized controlled trial. A total of 210 patients with a mean age of 62.2 years (136 [64.8%] males) in 2 hospitals were enrolled. Levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphate measured before (0 hour) and 24 hours after CRRT initiation. Before starting CRRT, at least 1 deficiency and excess in electrolytes or minerals were observed in 126 (60.0%) and 188 (67.6%) patients, respectively. The excess in these parameters was greatly improved, whereas hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia became more prevalent at 24 hours after CRRT. However, 1 and 2 or more deficiencies in those parameters at the 2 time points were not associated with mortality. However, during 28 days, 89 (71.2%) deaths occurred in patients with phosphate levels at 0 hour of ≥4.5 mg/dL as compared with 49 (57.6%) in patients with phosphate levels <4.5 mg/dL. The 90-day mortality was also significantly higher in patients with hyperphosphatemia. Similarly, in 184 patients who survived at 24 hours after CRRT, hyperphosphatemia conferred a 2.2-fold and 2.6-fold increased risk of 28- and 90-day mortality, respectively. The results remained unaltered when the serum phosphate level was analyzed as a continuous variable. Electrolyte and mineral disturbances are common, and hyperphosphatemia may predict poor prognosis in septic AKI patients undergoing CRRT."
Randomized trial of one-hour sodium bicarbonate vs standard periprocedural saline hydration in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing cardiovascular contrast procedures.,"Judith Kooiman, Jean-Paul P M de Vries, Jan Van der Heyden, Yvo W J Sijpkens, Paul R M van Dijkman, Jan J Wever, Hans van Overhagen, Antonie C Vahl, Nico Aarts, Iris J A M Verberk-Jonkers, Harald F H Brulez, Jaap F Hamming, Aart J van der Molen, Suzanne C Cannegieter, Hein Putter, Wilbert B van den Hout, Inci Kilicsoy, Ton J Rabelink, Menno V Huisman, Judith Kooimanet al.",2018 Feb 8,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29420536/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Guidelines advise periprocedural saline hydration for prevention of contrast induced-acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). We analysed whether 1-hour sodium bicarbonate hydration administered solely prior to intra-arterial contrast exposure is non-inferior to standard periprocedural saline hydration in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing elective cardiovascular diagnostic or interventional contrast procedures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed an open-label multicentre non-inferiority trial between 2011-2014. Patients were randomized to 1 hour pre-procedure sodium bicarbonate hydration (250 ml 1.4%, N = 168) or 4-12 hours saline hydration (1000 ml 0.9%, N = 165) prior to and following contrast administration (2000 ml of saline total). Primary outcome was the relative serum creatinine increase (%) 48-96 hours post contrast exposure. Secondary outcomes were: incidence of CI-AKI (serum creatinine increase>25% or >44μmol/L), recovery of renal function, the need for dialysis, and hospital costs within two months follow-up.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean relative creatinine increase was 3.1% (95%CI 0.9 to 5.2%) in the bicarbonate and 1.1% (95%CI -1.2 to 3.5%) in the saline arm, mean difference 1.9% (95%CI -1.2 to 5.1%, p-non-inferiority <0.001). CI-AKI occurred in 11 (6.7%) patients randomized to sodium bicarbonate and 12 (7.5%) to saline (p = 0.79). Renal function did not fully recover in 40.0% and 44.4% of CI-AKI patients, respectively (p = 0.84). No patient required dialysis. Mean costs for preventive hydration and clinical preparation for the contrast procedure were $1158 for sodium bicarbonate vs. $1561 for saline (p < 0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Short hydration with sodium bicarbonate prior to elective cardiovascular diagnostic or therapeutic contrast procedures is non-inferior to standard periprocedural saline hydration in CKD patients with respect to renal safety and results in considerable healthcare savings.

A Randomized Trial of Recombinant Human C1-Esterase-Inhibitor in the Prevention of Contrast-Induced Kidney Injury.,"Anneza Panagiotou, Marten Trendelenburg, Ingmar A F M Heijnen, Stephan Moser, Leo H Bonati, Tobias Breidthardt, Gregor Fahrni, Christoph Kaiser, Raban Jeger, Michael Osthoff, Anneza Panagiotouet al.",2020 Apr 13,JACC Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32171721/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      This study sought to determine the efficacy profile and safety of recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) in the prevention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury after elective coronary angiography.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Contrast-associated acute kidney injury is caused by tubular cytotoxicity and ischemia/reperfusion injury. rhC1INH is effective in reducing renal ischemia/reperfusion injury in experimental models.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center trial 77 patients with chronic kidney disease were randomized to receive 50 IU/kg rhC1INH before and 4 h after elective coronary angiography or placebo. The primary outcome was the peak change of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin within 48 h, a surrogate marker of kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median peak change of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was lower in the rhC1INH group (4.7 ng/ml vs. 22.5 ng/ml; p = 0.038) in the per-protocol population but not in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, and in patients with percutaneous coronary interventions (median, 1.8 ng/ml vs. 26.2 ng/ml; p = 0.039 corresponding to a median proportion peak change of 11% vs. 205%; p = 0.002). The incidence of a cystatin C increase ≥10% within 24 h was lower in the rhC1INH group (16% vs. 33%; p = 0.045), whereas the frequency of contrast-associated acute kidney injury was comparable. Adverse events during a 3-month follow-up were similarly distributed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Administration of rhC1INH before coronary angiography may attenuate renal injury as reflected by urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and cystatin C. The safety profile of rhC1INH was favorable in a patient population with multiple comorbidities.

          Results:
        
      
      Subject randomization: 159 to hypothermia, 154 to normothermia. Overall, 80% (249) developed AKI (any stage), and 66% (207) developed severe AKI. Cardiac patients (204, 65%) were more likely to develop severe AKI (72% vs 56%,p = 0.006). Preexisting cardiac or renal conditions, baseline lactate, vasoactive support, and systolic blood pressure were associated with severe AKI. Comparing hypothermia versus normothermia, there were no differences in severe AKI rate (63% vs 70%,p = 0.23), peak Cr, time to peak Cr, or freedom from mortality or severe AKI (p = 0.14). Severe AKI was associated with decreased hospital survival (48% vs 65%,p = 0.006) and decreased 12-month survival with favorable neurobehavioral outcome (30% vs 53%,p < 0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Severe post-IHCA AKI occurred frequently especially in those with preexisting cardiac or renal conditions and peri-arrest hemodynamic instability. Severe AKI was associated with decreased survival with favorable neurobehavioral outcome. Hypothermia did not decrease incidence of severe AKI post-IHCA."
Association between mineral and bone disorder in patients with acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery and adverse outcomes.,"Tianye Yang, Wenji Wang, Xiao Tang, Peng Shi, Lulu Zhang, Wenyan Yu, Yingxin Xie, Daqiao Guo, Feng Ding, Tianye Yanget al.",2019 Oct 15,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31615432/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Numerous studies have evaluated the prevalence and importance of mineral and bone disorders among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about dysregulated mineral and bone metabolism in acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We evaluated the association between mineral and bone metabolites and clinical outcomes in 158 patients who underwent cardiac surgery and developed AKI between June 2014 and January 2016. The baseline characteristics of the patients were recorded, and the levels of mineral and bone metabolites, including calcium, phosphate, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) and C-terminal fibroblast growth factor 23 (cFGF23) were measured within 12 h after establishing the clinical diagnosis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The serum phosphate, iPTH and cFGF23 levels were significantly associated with the 28-day mortality (phosphate: Hazard Ratio [HR] =2.620, 95% CI: 1.083 to 6.338, p = 0.035; iPTH: HR = 1.044, 95% CI: 1.001 to 1.090, p = 0.046; cFGF23: HR = 1.367, 95% CI: 1.168 to 1.599, p < 0.001). Moreover, higher serum cFGF23 and BAP levels were independently associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Additionally, we found that the serum cFGF23 levels rose most significantly and were associated with the severity of AKI (P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Mineral and bone metabolites are dysregulated and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes among patients with AKI.

Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin and Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury.,"Cristina Quintavalle, Chiara Viviani Anselmi, Francesca De Micco, Giuseppina Roscigno, Gabriella Visconti, Bruno Golia, Amelia Focaccio, Bruno Ricciardelli, Enzo Perna, Laura Papa, Elvira Donnarumma, Gerolama Condorelli, Carlo Briguori, Cristina Quintavalleet al.",2015 Sep,Circ Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26333343/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is an early marker of acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Urine NGAL and serum NGAL (sNGAL) were assessed at 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours after contrast media (CM) exposure in 458 high-risk patients (development set). Optimal thresholds in predicting contrast-induced AKI (serum creatinine [sCr] increase ≥0.3 mg/dL at 48 hours after CM administration) were identified. Major adverse events (MAE; death, dialysis, nonfatal myocardial infarction, sustained kidney injury, and myocardial revascularization) at 1 year were assessed. In the development set, optimal thresholds for contrast-induced AKI occurred at 6 hours for both urine NGAL (≥20 ng/mL; 97% negative predictive value and 27% positive predictive value) and sNGAL (≥179 ng/mL; 93% negative predictive value and 20% positive predictive value). Furthermore, sNGAL ≥179 ng/mL at 6 hours was an independent predictor of 1-year MAE. 1-year MAE occurred in 27/198 patients (13.5%) with sNGAL <179 ng/mL and sCr <0.3 mg/dL, in 57/193 (29.5%) patients with only sNGAL ≥179 ng/mL, and in 37/67 (55%) patients with sCr ≥0.3 mg/dL. In additional 253 patients (validation set), no patient with urine NGAL <20 ng/mL or sNGAL <179 ng/mL at 6 hours developed contrast-induced AKI. Furthermore, 6/68 (9%) patients with sNGAL <179 ng/mL and sCr increase <0.3 mg/dL had 1-year MAE versus 17/57 (30%) patients with sNGAL ≥179 ng/mL and sCr increase <0.3 mg/dL and 8/16 (50%) patients with sCr increase ≥0.3 mg/dL.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Urine NGAL <20 ng/mL and sNGAL <179 ng/mL at 6 hours are reliable markers for ruling out contrast-induced AKI. sNGAL ≥179 ng/mL at 6 hours predicts 1-year MAE.

      Hypotension and postoperative anaemia are associated with myocardial and renal injury after noncardiac surgery, but the interaction between them remains unknown.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To test the hypothesis that a double-hit of postoperative anaemia and hypotension synergistically worsens a 30-day composite of myocardial infarction (MI) and mortality and acute kidney injury (AKI). Characterising the interaction when hypotension and anaemia occur at same time on myocardial infarction and acute kidney injury.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Post hoc analysis of the POISE-2 trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Patients were enrolled between July 2010 and December 2013 at 135 hospitals in 23 countries.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Adults at least 45 years old with known or suspected cardiovascular disease. We excluded patients without available postoperative haemoglobin measurements or hypotension duration records. Exposures were the lowest haemoglobin concentration and the average daily duration of SBP less than 90 mmHg within the first four postoperative days.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was a collapsed composite of nonfatal MI and all-cause mortality during the initial 30 postoperative days; our secondary outcome was AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We included 7940 patients. The mean ± SD lowest postoperative haemoglobin was 10 ± 2 g dl -1 , and 24% of the patients had SBP less than 90 mmHg with daily duration ranging from 0 to 15 h. Four hundred and nine (5.2%) patients had an infarction or died within 30 postoperative days, and 417 (6.4%) patients developed AKI. Lowest haemoglobin concentrations less than 11 g dl -1 , and duration of SBP less than 90 mmHg was associated with greater hazard of composite outcome of nonfatal MI and all-cause mortality, as well as with AKI. However, we did not find significant multiplicative interactions between haemoglobin splines and hypotension duration on the primary composite or on AKI.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Postoperative anaemia and hypotension were meaningfully associated with both our primary composite and AKI. However, lack of significant interaction suggests that the effects of hypotension and anaemia are additive rather than multiplicative.

Effect of dexmedetomidine on the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury in living donor liver transplantation recipients: a randomized controlled trial.,"Hye-Mee Kwon, Sa-Jin Kang, Sang-Bin Han, Jae Hwan Kim, Sung-Hoon Kim, In-Gu Jun, Jun-Gol Song, Gyu-Sam Hwang, Hye-Mee Kwonet al.",2024 Jul 1,Int J Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38537086/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complications after living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) that has great impact on recipient and graft outcomes. Dexmedetomidine is reported to decrease the incidence of AKI. In the current study, the authors investigated whether intraoperative dexmedetomidine infusion would reduce the AKI following LDLT.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      In total, 205 adult patients undergoing elective LDLT were randomly assigned to the dexmedetomidine group ( n =103) or the control group ( n =102). Dexmedetomidine group received continuous dexmedetomidine infusion at a rate of 0.4 mcg/kg/h after the anesthesia induction until 2 h after graft reperfusion. The primary outcome was to compare the incidence of AKI. Secondary outcomes included serial lactate levels during surgery, chronic kidney disease, major adverse cardiovascular events, early allograft dysfunction, graft failure, overall mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit, and hospital length of stay. Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were also collected.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 205 recipients, 42.4% ( n =87) developed AKI. The incidence of AKI was lower in the dexmedetomidine group (35.0%, n =36/103) compared with the control (50.0%, n =51/102) ( P =0.042). There were significantly lower lactate levels in the dexmedetomidine group after reperfusion [4.39 (3.99-4.8) vs 5.02 (4.62-5.42), P =0.031] until the end of surgery [4.23 (3.73-4.74) vs 5.35 (4.84-5.85), P =0.002]. There were no significant differences in the other secondary outcomes besides lactate. Also, intraoperative mean blood pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance did not show any difference.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our study suggests that intraoperative dexmedetomidine administration was associated with significantly decreased AKI incidence and lower intraoperative serum lactate levels in LDLT recipients, without untoward hemodynamic effects."
Detection of acute kidney injury in premature asphyxiated neonates by serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (sNGAL)--sensitivity and specificity of a potential new biomarker.,"Biljana Pejović, Jelena Erić-Marinković, Marija Pejović, Jelena Kotur-Stevuljević, Amira Peco-Antić, Biljana Pejovićet al.",2015 Oct 15,Biochem Med (Zagreb),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26525750/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). In recent years, every effort is made for early detection of AKI. Our hypothesis was that serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (sNGAL) may be a reliable screening test for early diagnosis of AKI in premature neonates after perinatal asphyxia. Therefore, our aim was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of sNGAL for AKI in premature asphyxiated neonates.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      AKI was defined in the third day of life (DOL 3) as a serum creatinine (sCr) increase ≥26.5 μmol/L from baseline (the lowest previous sCr). According to the increase of sCr, AKI patients were divided in AKIN1 (sCr increase up to 1.9 baseline) and AKIN2 (sCr increase from 2.0 to 2.9 baseline). sNGAL levels were measured on DOL 1, 3 and 7.
    


          Results:
        
      
      AKI was diagnosed in 73 (0.676) of 108 enrolled premature asphyxiated neonates. Sixty one patients (0.836) were classified in AKIN1 and 12 patients (0.164) in AKIN2. sNGAL reached the maximal concentrations on DOL 1 within 4 hours after admission to NICU, being higher in AKI compared with no-AKI group (160.8±113.1 vs. 87.1±81.6; P<0.001) as well as in AKIN2 compared with AKIN1 group (222.8±112.9 vs. 147.8±109.9; P<0.001). The best areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for prediction of AKI were 0.72 [95% (0.62-0.80) P<0.001] on DOL1 at 2h and 0.72 [95% (0.63-0.80) P<0.001] at 4th hour after admission respectively. The corresponding sNGAL cutoff concentrations were 84.87 ng/mL (sensitivity 69.0% and specificity 71.9%) and 89.43 ng/mL (sensitivity 65.7% and specificity 74.3%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In premature asphyxiated neonates sNGAL measured within the first 4 hours of DOL 1 is predictive of the occurrence and severity of AKI. Therefore, plasma levels of NGAL may be used for early diagnosis of AKI in these patients."
Team-Based Coaching Intervention to Improve Contrast-Associated Acute Kidney Injury: A Cluster-Randomized Trial.,"Jeremiah R Brown, Richard Solomon, Meagan E Stabler, Sharon Davis, Elizabeth Carpenter-Song, Lisa Zubkoff, Dax M Westerman, Chad Dorn, Kevin C Cox, Freneka Minter, Hani Jneid, Jesse W Currier, S Ahmed Athar, Saket Girotra, Calvin Leung, Thomas J Helton, Ajay Agarwal, Mladen I Vidovich, Mary E Plomondon, Stephen W Waldo, Kelly A Aschbrenner, A James O'Malley, Michael E Matheny, Jeremiah R Brownet al.",2023 Mar 1,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36787125/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Up to 14% of patients in the United States undergoing cardiac catheterization each year experience AKI. Consistent use of risk minimization preventive strategies may improve outcomes. We hypothesized that team-based coaching in a Virtual Learning Collaborative (Collaborative) would reduce postprocedural AKI compared with Technical Assistance (Assistance), both with and without Automated Surveillance Reporting (Surveillance).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The IMPROVE AKI trial was a 2×2 factorial cluster-randomized trial across 20 Veterans Affairs medical centers (VAMCs). Participating VAMCs received Assistance, Assistance with Surveillance, Collaborative, or Collaborative with Surveillance for 18 months to implement AKI prevention strategies. The Assistance and Collaborative approaches promoted hydration and limited NPO and contrast dye dosing. We fit logistic regression models for AKI with site-level random effects accounting for the clustering of patients within medical centers with a prespecified interest in exploring differences across the four intervention arms.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among VAMCs' 4517 patients, 510 experienced AKI (235 AKI events among 1314 patients with preexisting CKD). AKI events in each intervention cluster were 110 (13%) in Assistance, 122 (11%) in Assistance with Surveillance, 190 (13%) in Collaborative, and 88 (8%) in Collaborative with Surveillance. Compared with sites receiving Assistance alone, case-mix-adjusted differences in AKI event proportions were -3% (95% confidence interval [CI], -4 to -3) for Assistance with Surveillance, -3% (95% CI, -3 to -2) for Collaborative, and -5% (95% CI, -6 to -5) for Collaborative with Surveillance. The Collaborative with Surveillance intervention cluster had a substantial 46% reduction in AKI compared with Assistance alone (adjusted odds ratio=0.54; 0.40-0.74).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This implementation trial estimates that the combination of Collaborative with Surveillance reduced the odds of AKI by 46% at VAMCs and is suggestive of a reduction among patients with CKD.

          Methods:
        
      
      The randomised, controlled, prospective, multicentric study was conducted in 2020 during the period from January 2020 to December 2020 at Kafrelsheikh University Hospital, International Cardiac Centre and Alexandria New Medical Centre, Egypt, and comprised patients with left main coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass graftsurgery. The patients were randomised to on-pump surgery group I (Control Group) and off-pump surgery group II(Interventional Group). All patients were assessed pre-operatively for the presence of comorbid conditions and post-operatively for myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, pneumonia, sternal dehiscence and 3-month mortality. Data was analysed using SPSS 20.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 60 patients, 44(73.3%) were men and 16(26.6%) were women. The overall mean age was 66.4±9.2 years. There were 30(50%) patients in each of the two groups. There were 2(6.7%) cases of myocardial infarction in group I and 1(3.3%) in group II. There was 1(3.3%) case of acute kidney injury in group I and none in group II. There were 3(10%) cases of pneumonia in group 1 compared to 1(3.3%) in group II. There was 1(3.3%) case of sternal dehiscence in group I and none in group II. Mortality at 3 months was 2(6.7%) in group I and 1(3.3%) in group II. There was no significant difference with respect to outcome between the groups (p>0.05).
    


          Conclusions:

Perioperative THR-184 and AKI after Cardiac Surgery.,"Jonathan Himmelfarb, Glenn M Chertow, Peter A McCullough, Thierry Mesana, Andrew D Shaw, Thoralf M Sundt, Craig Brown, David Cortville, François Dagenais, Benoit de Varennes, Manuel Fontes, Jerome Rossert, Jean-Claude Tardif, Jonathan Himmelfarbet al.",2018 Feb,J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203473/,"acute renal failure, bone morphogenetic protein, randomized controlled trials.","AKI after cardiac surgery is associated with mortality, prolonged hospital length of stay, use of dialysis, and subsequent CKD. We evaluated the effects of THR-184, a bone morphogenetic protein-7 agonist, in patients at high risk for AKI after cardiac surgery. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose comparison of the safety and efficacy of perioperative THR-184 using a two-stage seamless adaptive design in 452 patients between 18 and 85 years of age who were scheduled for nonemergent cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass and had recognized risk factors for AKI. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients who developed AKI according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. The proportion of patients who developed AKI within 7 days of surgery was similar in THR-184 treatment groups and placebo groups (range, 74%-79%; P=0.43). Prespecified secondary end point analysis did not show significant differences in the severity of AKI stage (P=0.53) or the total duration of AKI (P=0.44). A composite of death, dialysis, or sustained impaired renal function by day 30 after surgery did not differ between groups (range, 11%-20%; P=0.46). Safety-related outcomes were similar across all treatment groups. In conclusion, compared with placebo, administration of perioperative THR-184 through a range of dose exposures failed to reduce the incidence, severity, or duration of AKI after cardiac surgery in high-risk patients."
The impact of higher protein dosing on outcomes in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: a post hoc analysis of the EFFORT protein trial.,"Christian Stoppe#, Jayshil J Patel#, Alex Zarbock, Zheng-Yii Lee, Todd W Rice, Bruno Mafrici, Rebecca Wehner, Man Hung Manuel Chan, Peter Chi Keung Lai, Kristen MacEachern, Pavlos Myrianthefs, Evdoxia Tsigou, Luis Ortiz-Reyes, Xuran Jiang, Andrew G Day, M Shahnaz Hasan, Patrick Meybohm, Lu Ke, Daren K Heyland, Christian Stoppeet al.",2023 Oct 18,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37853490/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Based on low-quality evidence, current nutrition guidelines recommend the delivery of high-dose protein in critically ill patients. The EFFORT Protein trial showed that higher protein dose is not associated with improved outcomes, whereas the effects in critically ill patients who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) need further evaluation. The overall aim is to evaluate the effects of high-dose protein in critically ill patients who developed different stages of AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this post hoc analysis of the EFFORT Protein trial, we investigated the effect of high versus usual protein dose (≥ 2.2 vs. ≤ 1.2 g/kg body weight/day) on time-to-discharge alive from the hospital (TTDA) and 60-day mortality and in different subgroups in critically ill patients with AKI as defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria within 7 days of ICU admission. The associations of protein dose with incidence and duration of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) were also investigated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 1329 randomized patients, 312 developed AKI and were included in this analysis (163 in the high and 149 in the usual protein dose group). High protein was associated with a slower time-to-discharge alive from the hospital (TTDA) (hazard ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.8) and higher 60-day mortality (relative risk 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.8). Effect modification was not statistically significant for any subgroup, and no subgroups suggested a beneficial effect of higher protein, although the harmful effect of higher protein target appeared to disappear in patients who received kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Protein dose was not significantly associated with the incidence of AKI and KRT or duration of KRT.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In critically ill patients with AKI, high protein may be associated with worse outcomes in all AKI stages. Recommendation of higher protein dosing in AKI patients should be carefully re-evaluated to avoid potential harmful effects especially in patients who were not treated with KRT.

Contrast-Associated Acute Kidney Injury and Serious Adverse Outcomes Following Angiography.,"Steven D Weisbord, Paul M Palevsky, James S Kaufman, Hongsheng Wu, Maria Androsenko, Ryan E Ferguson, Chirag R Parikh, Deepak L Bhatt, Martin Gallagher                              ;, PRESERVE Trial Investigators, Steven D Weisbordet al.",2020 Mar 24,J Am Coll Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32192658/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) associates with an increased relative risk for serious adverse outcomes. However, the magnitude of this risk and the incidence of clinically significant CA-AKI derived from analyses of large cohorts with prospective assessment of CA-AKI and subsequent outcomes are unknown.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study sought to characterize the relative risk for and incidence of serious adverse outcomes following the development of CA-AKI and to explore whether CA-AKI mediates the association of pre-angiography estimated glomerular filtration rate with adverse outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Among 4,418 participants in the PRESERVE (Prevention of Serious Adverse Outcomes Following Angiography) trial with comprehensive baseline and outcome data, we assessed whether CA-AKI was associated with the 90-day outcome comprising death, need for dialysis, or persistent impairment in kidney function. We calculated the incidence of clinically significant CA-AKI (i.e., proportion of patients who developed CA-AKI and the 90-day outcome) and examined whether CA-AKI was a mediator of the association of baseline kidney function with the 90-day outcome.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CA-AKI was associated with an increased relative risk for 90-day death, need for dialysis, or persistent kidney impairment (odds ratio: 3.93; 95% confidence interval: 2.82 to 5.49; p < 0.0001). The incidence of clinically significant CA-AKI was 1.2% (53 of 4,418 patients). CA-AKI was not a mediator of the association of pre-angiography estimated glomerular filtration rate with the primary outcome.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Whereas CA-AKI is associated with an increased relative risk of serious, adverse 90-day outcomes, the incidence of clinically significant CA-AKI is very low. CA-AKI does not mediate the association of the pre-angiography estimated glomerular filtration rate with these outcomes."

      Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery and is associated with adverse outcomes. Although short-term calorie restriction (CR) has proven protective in rodent models of acute kidney injury, similar effects have not yet been demonstrated in humans.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      CR_KCH (Effect of a Preoperative Calorie Restriction on Renal Function After Cardiac Surgery) is a randomized controlled trial in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a formula diet containing 60% of the daily energy requirement (CR group) or ad libitum food (control group) for 7 days before surgery. In total, 82 patients were enrolled between April 16, 2012, and February 5, 2015. There was no between-group difference in the primary end point of median serum creatinine increment after 24 hours (control group: 0.0 mg/dL [-0.1 - (+0.2) mg/dL]; CR group: 0.0 mg/dL [-0.2 - (+0.2) mg/dL]; P=0.39). CR prevented a rise in median creatinine at 48 hours (control group: +0.1 mg/dL [0.0 - 0.3 mg/dL]; CR group: -0.1 mg/dL [-0.2 - (+0.1) mg/dL]; P=0.03), with most pronounced effects observed in male patients and patients with a body mass index >25. This benefit persisted until discharge: Median creatinine decreased by 0.1 mg/dL (-0.2 - 0.0 mg/dL) in the CR group, whereas it increased by 0.1 mg/dL (0.0 - 0.3 mg/dL; P=0.0006) in the control group. Incidence of acute kidney injury was reduced by 5.8% (41.7% in the CR group compared with 47.5% in the control group). Safety-related events did not differ between groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite disappointing results with respect to creatinine rise within the first 24 hours, the benefits observed at later time points and the subgroup analyses suggest the protective potential of short-term CR in patients at risk for acute kidney injury, warranting further investigation.

Alfapump® system vs. large volume paracentesis for refractory ascites: A multicenter randomized controlled study.,"Christophe Bureau, Danielle Adebayo, Mael Chalret de Rieu, Laure Elkrief, Dominique Valla, Markus Peck-Radosavljevic, Anne McCune, Victor Vargas, Macarena Simon-Talero, Juan Cordoba, Paolo Angeli, Silvia Rosi, Stewart MacDonald, Massimo Malago, Maria Stepanova, Zobair M Younossi, Claudia Trepte, Randall Watson, Oleg Borisenko, Sun Sun, Neil Inhaber, Rajiv Jalan, Christophe Bureauet al.",2017 Nov,J Hepatol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28645737/,No keywords found,"Background and aims:
        
      
      Patients with refractory ascites (RA) require repeated large volume paracenteses (LVP), which involves frequent hospital visits and is associated with a poor quality-of-life. This study assessed safety and efficacy of an automated, low-flow pump (alfapump® [AP]) compared with LVP standard of care [SoC].
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A randomized controlled trial, in seven centers, with six month patient observation was conducted. Primary outcome was time to first LVP. Secondary outcomes included paracentesis requirement, safety, health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), and survival. Nutrition, hemodynamics, and renal injury biomarkers were assessed in a sub-study at three months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty patients were randomized and 58 were analyzed (27 AP, 31 SoC, mean age 61.9years, mean MELD 11.7). Eighteen patients were included in the sub-study. Compared with SoC, median time to first LVP was not reached after six months in the AP group, meaning a significant reduction in LVP requirement for the AP patients (AP, median not reached; SoC, 15.0days (HR 0.13; 95%CI 13.0-22.0; p<0.001), and AP patients also showed significantly improved Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) scores compared with SoC patients (p<0.05 between treatment arms). Improvements in nutritional parameters were observed for hand-grip strength (p=0.044) and body mass index (p<0.001) in the sub-study. Compared with SoC, more AP patients reported adverse events (AEs; 96.3% vs. 77.4%, p=0.057) and serious AEs (85.2 vs. 45.2%, p=0.002). AEs consisted predominantly of acute kidney injury in the immediate post-operative period, and re-intervention for pump related issues, and were treatable in most cases. Survival was similar in AP and SoC.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The AP system is effective for reducing the need for paracentesis and improving quality of life in cirrhotic patients with RA. Although the frequency of SAEs (and by inference hospitalizations) was significantly higher in the AP group, they were generally limited and did not impact survival. Lay summary: The alfapump® moves abdominal fluid into the bladder from where it is then removed by urination. Compared with standard treatment, the alfapump reduces the need for large volume paracentesis (manual fluid removal by needle) in patients with medically untreatable ascites. This can improve life quality for these patients. www.clinicaltrials.gov#NCT01528410."

However, the nephrotoxicity associated with these immunosuppressants impairs patients' long-term survival after renal allograft. Therefore, novel regimens that minimize or even eliminate calcineurin inhibitors could improve transplantation outcomes. In this pilot study, we investigated the use of low-dose tacrolimus in combination with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are immunosuppressive and prolong allograft survival in experimental organ transplant models. Donor-derived, bone marrow MSCs combined with a sparing dose of tacrolimus (0.04-0.05 mg/kg/day) were administered to 16 de novo living-related kidney transplant recipients; 16 other patients received a standard dose of tacrolimus (0.07-0.08 mg/kg/day). The safety of MSC infusion, acute rejection, graft function, graft survival, and patient survival were evaluated over ≥24 months following kidney transplantation. All patients survived and had stable renal function at the 24 month follow-up. The combination of low-dose tacrolimus and MSCs was as effective as standard dose tacrolimus in maintaining graft survival at least 2 years after transplantation. In addition, both groups had similar urea, urine protein, urinary RBC, urinary WBC, 24-h urine protein, and creatinine clearance rates from 7 days to 24 months after transplantation. Furthermore, no differences in the proportion of lymphocytes, CD19, CD3, CD34, CD38, and natural killer cells were detected between the control and experimental groups. None of the MSC recipients experienced immediate or long-term toxicity from the treatment. This preliminary data suggests that the addition of MSCs permits the use of lower dosages of nephrotoxic calcineurin inhibitors following renal transplantation."
Measurement of the Concentration of Citrate in Human Biofluids in Patients Undergoing Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy Using Regional Citrate Anticoagulation: Application of a Two-Step Enzymatic Assay.,"Chris M Anstey, Fraser D Russell, Chris M Ansteyet al.",2021,Blood Purif,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33550280/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is now commonly used to treat acute kidney injury in critically ill patients. The concentration of citrate is not routinely measured, with citrate accumulation and/or toxicity primarily assessed using surrogate measures.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to measure the concentration of citrate in plasma and ultrafiltrate in patients receiving CRRT with RCA using a modified commercial enzymatic assay.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      After meeting inclusion criteria, blood was sampled from 20 patients before, during, and after episodes of filtration. Using spectrophotometry, samples were tested for citrate concentration. Demographic and other clinical and biochemical data were also collected. Throughout, a 15 mmol/L solution of trisodium citrate was used as the prefilter anticoagulant. Results were analysed using STATA (v15.0) and presented as mean (SD), median (IQR), or simple proportion. Comparisons were made using either the Student t test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Correlation was assessed using Pearson's r.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty patients (17 males) were enrolled in the study. Mean (SD) age was 63.7 years (9.9). Median (IQR) ICU length of stay was 281 h (199, 422) with 85% undergoing intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Median APACHE 3 score was 95 (87, 117) with an overall 30% mortality rate. Median filtration time was 85 h (46, 149). No difference was found between pre- and post-filtration plasma citrate concentrations (79 µmol/L [50] vs. 71 µmol/L [42], p = 0.65). Mean citrate concentration during filtration was 508 µmol/L (221) with a maximum of 1,070 µmol/L. This was significantly higher than the pre/post levels (p < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Plasma concentrations of citrate rose significantly during episodes of CRRT using RCA returning back to normal after cessation of treatment."
Early detection of acute kidney injury in the perioperative period of liver transplant with neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin.,"Camila Lima, Luciana Bertocco de Paiva Haddad, Patrícia Donado Vaz de Melo, Luiz Marcelo Malbouisson, Lilian Pires Freitas do Carmo, Luiz Augusto Carneiro D'Albuquerque, Etienne Macedo, Camila Limaet al.",2019 Oct 15,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31615452/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in patients undergoing liver transplant (LT) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We aim to evaluate the pattern of urine and plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) elevation during the perioperative period of LT and to assess it as a prognostic marker for AKI progression, need for dialysis and mortality.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We assessed NGAL levels before induction of anesthesia, after portal reperfusion and at 6, 18, 24, and 48 h after surgery. Patients were monitored daily during the first week after LT.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 100 enrolled patients undergoing liver transplant, 59 developed severe AKI based on the KDIGO serum creatinine (sCr) criterion; 34 were dialysed, and 21 died within 60 days after LT. Applying a cut-off value of 136 ng/ml, UNGAL values 6 h after surgery was a good predictor of AKI development within 7 days after surgery, having a positive predictive value (PPV) of 80% with an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86). PNGAL at 18 h after LT was also a good predictor of AKI in the first week, having a PPV of 81% and AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.60-0.88). Based on PNGAL and UNGAL cut-off criteria levels, time to AKI diagnosis was 28 and 23 h earlier than by sCr, respectively. The best times to assess the need for dialysis were 18 h after LT by PNGAL and 06 h after LT by UNGAL.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In conclusion, the plasma and urine NGAL elevation pattern in the perioperative period of the liver transplant can predict AKI diagnosis earlier. UNGAL was an early independent predictor of AKI development and need for dialysis. Further studies are needed to assess whether the clinical use of biomarkers can improve patient outcomes.

      While patients with chronic kidney disease have reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL), long-term HRQOL of survivors of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unclear.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We analysed HRQOL from the Prolonged Outcomes Study of the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level Replacement Therapy (POST-RENAL) study and compared findings with those from a general Australian adult population enrolled in the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study. We used a multivariate analysis adjusted for baseline characteristics along with sensitivity analysis using age and sex-matched case controls.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the POST-RENAL study, 282 participants had HRQOL data collected using the SF-12 questionnaire. This was compared with 6330 participants from the AusDiab study. Unadjusted analyses showed that POST-RENAL participants had lower physical component scores (PCS, mean score 40.0 vs 49.8, P<0.0001) and lower mental component scores (MCS, mean score 49.8 vs 53.9, P<0.0001) than the AusDiab group. After age and sex matching, the difference in PCS and MCS remained statistically significant (P<0.0001). Advanced age, reduced renal function and albuminuria (all P ≤ 0.01) were all strongly associated with lower PCS values but not MCS values. After matching subsets of the cohorts on the basis of age, sex and renal function, PCS and MCS were lower in the POST-RENAL group (P<0.0001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Survivors of severe AKI in the POST-RENAL study had lower physical and mental components of HRQOL compared with general population, even after adjustment for their reduced renal function. Increasing age and reduced renal function were associated with poorer physical QOL."
Impact of Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention on Short- and Long-Term Outcomes: Pooled Analysis From the HORIZONS-AMI and ACUITY Trials.,"Daniele Giacoppo, Mahesh V Madhavan, Usman Baber, Josephine Warren, Sameer Bansilal, Bernhard Witzenbichler, George D Dangas, Ajay J Kirtane, Ke Xu, Ran Kornowski, Sorin J Brener, Philippe Généreux, Gregg W Stone, Roxana Mehran, Daniele Giacoppoet al.",2015 Aug,Circ Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26198286/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), defined as a serum creatinine increase ≥0.5 mg/dL or ≥25% within 72 hours after contrast exposure, is a common complication of procedures requiring contrast media and is associated with increased short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Few studies describe the effects of CI-AKI in a large-scale acute coronary syndrome population, and the relationship between CI-AKI and bleeding events has not been extensively explored. We sought to evaluate the impact of CI-AKI after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      We pooled patient-level data for 9512 patients from the percutaneous coronary intervention cohorts of the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) and Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) multicenter randomized trials. Patients were classified according to CI-AKI development, and cardiovascular outcomes at 30 days and 1 year were compared between groups. A total of 1212 patients (12.7%) developed CI-AKI. Patients with CI-AKI were older, with a more extensive comorbidity profile than without CI-AKI. Multivariable analysis confirmed several previously identified predictors of CI-AKI, including diabetes mellitus, contrast volume, age, and baseline hemoglobin. Mortality rates were significantly higher in the CI-AKI group at 30 days (4.9% versus 0.7%; P<0.0001) and 1 year (9.8% versus 2.9%; P<0.0001), as were rates of 1-year myocardial infarction, definite/probable stent thrombosis, target lesion revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events. Major bleeding (13.8% versus 5.4%; hazard ratio, 2.64; 95% confidence interval, 2.21-3.15; P<0.0001) was also higher in patients with CI-AKI. After multivariable adjustment, results were unchanged.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      CI-AKI after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome is independently associated with increased risk of short- and long-term ischemic and hemorrhagic events.

Furosemide Stress Test and Biomarkers for the Prediction of AKI Severity.,"Jay L Koyner, Danielle L Davison, Ermira Brasha-Mitchell, Divya M Chalikonda, John M Arthur, Andrew D Shaw, James A Tumlin, Sharon A Trevino, Michael R Bennett, Paul L Kimmel, Michael G Seneff, Lakhmir S Chawla, Jay L Koyneret al.",2015 Aug,J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25655065/,"acute renal failure, clinical nephrology, diuretics.","Clinicians have access to limited tools that predict which patients with early AKI will progress to more severe stages. In early AKI, urine output after a furosemide stress test (FST), which involves intravenous administration of furosemide (1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg), can predict the development of stage 3 AKI. We measured several AKI biomarkers in our previously published cohort of 77 patients with early AKI who received an FST and evaluated the ability of FST urine output and biomarkers to predict the development of stage 3 AKI (n=25 [32.5%]), receipt of RRT (n=11 [14.2%]), or inpatient mortality (n=16 [20.7%]). With an area under the curve (AUC)±SEM of 0.87±0.09 (P<0.0001), 2-hour urine output after FST was significantly better than each urinary biomarker tested in predicting progression to stage 3 (P<0.05). FST urine output was the only biomarker to significantly predict RRT (0.86±0.08; P=0.001). Regardless of the end point, combining FST urine output with individual biomarkers using logistic regression did not significantly improve risk stratification (ΔAUC, P>0.10 for all). When FST urine output was assessed in patients with increased biomarker levels, the AUC for progression to stage 3 improved to 0.90±0.06 and the AUC for receipt of RRT improved to 0.91±0.08. Overall, in the setting of early AKI, FST urine output outperformed biochemical biomarkers for prediction of progressive AKI, need for RRT, and inpatient mortality. Using a FST in patients with increased biomarker levels improves risk stratification, although further research is needed."
"Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in human blood: effects of extended haemodialysis in the critically ill patient with acute kidney injury, protein binding to human serum albumin and proteolysis by thermolysin.","Mustafa Erinc Sitar, Arslan Arinc Kayacelebi, Bibiana Beckmann, Jan T Kielstein, Dimitrios Tsikas, Mustafa Erinc Sitaret al.",2015 Sep,Amino Acids,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25921952/,No keywords found,"Free, non-protein bound asymmetrically guanidine-dimethylated arginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Human erythrocytic membrane comprises considerable amounts of large (>50 kDa) ADMA-containing proteins. Location in the erythrocyte membrane and identity and physiological functions of ADMA-containing proteins are unrevealed. In healthy subjects, the concentration of free ADMA in heparinised plasma is almost identical to that of serum. We hypothesised that the robustness of free ADMA concentration in human blood is due to a remarkable resistance of erythrocytic ADMA-containing proteins against proteases. In vivo, we investigated the course of the concentration of ADMA in serum and EDTA plasma of a critically ill patient with acute kidney injury during extended haemodialysis. In vitro, we studied the effects of thermolysin, a useful experimental proteolytic enzyme of erythrocyte membrane proteins, on erythrocytic ADMA. The protein binding (PB) of ADMA to human serum albumin (HSA) was also determined. In these studies, ADMA was measured by a previously reported, fully validated GC-MS/MS method. We measured almost identical ADMA concentrations in plasma and serum samples of the patient. During dialysis, the circulating ADMA concentration decreased slowly and moderately indicating removal of this substance, which was however much less than expected from its low molecular weight (202 Da) and high water solubility. After dialysis, circulating ADMA concentration increased again, a phenomenon called rebound, and ADMA reached higher levels compared to the baseline. The PB value of ADMA to HSA was about 30 %. This surprisingly high PB value of ADMA to HSA may be an explanation for the rather poor dialysance of ADMA. Washed human erythrocytes suspended in phosphate-buffered physiological saline were found not to release appreciable amounts of free and ADMA-containing proteins. The lack of effect of coagulation or anticoagulation on the concentration of circulating free ADMA in humans is likely to be due to a remarkable resistance of ADMA-containing proteins in the erythrocyte membrane against proteases in vivo in humans. Our study suggests that free ADMA is released in the circulating blood at relatively high rates. The considerable PB of ADMA to HSA is likely to add to the apparently poor dialysability of ADMA. Other contributing factors could be redistribution of free ADMA between plasma and erythrocytes in favour of plasma ADMA and parallel formation of free ADMA from erythrocytic ADMA-containing proteins during haemodialysis."
Preventive Effect of Trimetazidine on Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in CKD Patients Based on Urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (uNGAL): A randomized Clinical Trial.,"Amirhossein Mirhosseni, Behzad Farahani, Alireza Gandomi-Mohammadabadi, Hossein Keyvani, Maryam Biglari-Abhari, Alireza Davari, Mohammad Hossein Vazirizade-Mahabadi, Shokufeh Savaj, Amirhossein Mirhosseniet al.",2019 May,Iran J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31209192/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Contrast-induced Acute Kidney Injury (CI-AKI) is a prevalent complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of periprocedural administration of trimetazidine as an anti-oxidant agent on the incidence of CI-AKI in CKD patients based on changes of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (uNGAL) level, which has recently been introduced as an early predictor of CI-AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred CKD patients with a mean GFR of 50 ± 7 cc/min who were candidate for coronary angiography assigned randomly to receive (50 patients, intervention group) or not receive (50 patients, control group) trimetazidine (70mg/d) for 72 hours. CI-AKI was defined as 0.5 mg or 25% increase in serum creatinine. We also checked uNGAL before and 12h after angiography.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Serum creatinine, showed a trend of less increment in the case group, although could not achieve a significant difference, there was a significant difference in urinary NGAL rise between two groups. CI-AKI was defined as 1.7 times increase in uNGAL level (12h after angiography to pre-procedurally uNGAL level ratio) according to the ROC curves. The incidence of CI-AKI according to urinary NGAL definition was 8% in the Trimetazidine group and 24% in the control group (P < .05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We concluded that Trimetazidine treatment before angiography may be effective in CI-AKI prevention. Moreover, it is shown that 1.7 times increase in urine NGAL after angiography is a valuable cut off point for clinicians to discriminate high risk patients for contrast nephropathy."
"Urine alkalinisation to prevent contrast-induced acute kidney injury: the prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label TEATE trial.","Marco Lombardi, Michela Molisana, Eugenio Genovesi, Carlo De Innocentiis, Ugo Limbruno, Leonardo Misuraca, Luciano Moretti, Luca Di Vito, Giulia Renda, Marco Zimarino, Marta Di Nicola, Raffaele De Caterina, Marco Lombardiet al.",2022 Sep 20,EuroIntervention,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35620986/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is prognostically relevant in invasive cardiological and radiological procedures. The administration of sodium bicarbonate has controversial effects. It has been hypothesised that bicarbonate is ineffective when unable to achieve adequate urine alkalinisation.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      We tested the hypothesis that alkaline urine status with oral or intravenous (i.v.) bicarbonate on top of hydration alone prevents CI-AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a prospective, randomised, parallel-group, open-label trial, we compared 1) saline hydration alone (n=81); 2) i.v. bicarbonate (n=82); and 3) oral bicarbonate (n=78), in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) scheduled for the intra-arterial administration of contrast medium. The primary endpoint was the incidence of CI-AKI according to alkaline urine status achieved immediately before angiography. Secondary endpoints were the mean change of urine pH up to the time of angiography and the incidence of CI-AKI in the three groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of CI-AKI was not significantly different in the three treatment arms (20% in the hydration group, 21% in the oral bicarbonate group and 22% in the i.v. bicarbonate group; p=0.94). Patients achieving a pH >6 before angiography (n=145) had a significantly lower incidence of CI-AKI compared with the others (n=96; odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.25-0.90; p=0.023, primary study hypothesis). The proportion of patients achieving a pH >6 was higher in the i.v. and oral bicarbonate groups compared with hydration alone.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Urinary pH before administration of contrast medium is an inverse correlate of CI-AKI incidence, and bicarbonate is superior to hydration alone in achieving urinary alkalinisation. Since, however, bicarbonate did not reduce the incidence of CI-AKI, we conclude that urinary pH is a marker and not a mediator of CI-AKI (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02980003)."
One-year results of the ICON (Ionic versus non-ionic Contrast to Obviate worsening Nephropathy after angioplasty in chronic renal failure patients) Study.,"Gennaro Giustino, Usman Baber, Ioannis Mastoris, Georgios J Vlachojannis, Jennifer Yu, Paul S Teirstein, William E Downey, Wayne B Batchelor, Peter J Casterella, Eugenia Nikolsky, S Chiu Wong, Kleanthis N Theodoropoulos, George D Dangas, Roxana Mehran, Gennaro Giustinoet al.",2016 Mar,Catheter Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26481591/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Long-term clinical outcomes after exposure to non-ionic iso-osmolar contrast medium (IOCM) or ionic low-osmolar CM (LOCM) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing coronary angiography are unclear.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The ICON trial was a prospective, double-blinded, multicentre study that randomly assigned 146 patients with CKD undergoing coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention to the non-ionic IOCM Iodixanol or the ionic LOCM Ioxaglate. We report the 1-year clinical outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After randomization, baseline and procedural characteristics were well-matched between the two groups. At 1 year, three deaths (4.1%) occurred in the ioxaglate and nine deaths in the iodixanol group (13.6%, P = 0.07). The cardiac death rate at 1 year was 2.7% in the ioxaglate group and 9.1% in the iodixanol group (P = 0.07). There were no significant differences in the rates of myocardial infarction (1.4% vs. 1.5%; P = 1.00) and repeated revascularization (6.8% vs. 9.1%; P = 0.75).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The use of ionic LOCM ioxaglate was associated with a numerically lower mortality at 1 year as compared to iodixanol in patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Future studies evaluating long-term safety following exposure to different types of CM are warranted."

          Methods:
        
      
      This study randomized 300 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention to receive conventional treatment in the control group (hydration only; n = 150) vs. nicorandil therapy (nicorandil 10 mg three times daily plus hydration; n = 150). The primary endpoint was the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as rise in serum creatinine ≥44.2 μmol/L or >25% above baseline within 72 hours after exposure to contrast administered during percutaneous coronary intervention. Secondary endpoints included differences in post-percutaneous coronary intervention serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine clearance rate, cystatin-C, and occurrence of major adverse events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Contrast-induced nephropathy incidence was 3.3% (5/150) in the nicorandil group vs. 10.7% (16/150) in the control group (P < 0.05). At 48 and 72 hours after contrast administration, cystatin-C levels were significantly lower and creatinine clearance rate were significantly higher with nicroandil therapy compared to conventional treatment (all P values <0.05). No statistical difference was observed in the incidence of major post-procedure side effect events in hospital and fourteen days of follow-up period between the nicorandil group and control group (3.3% vs. 4.0%, P > 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Compared to conventional treatment, oral nicorandil therapy was associated with less contrast-induced nephropathy and improved renal function following contrast administration during percutaneous coronary intervention."
Is there a renoprotective value to leukodepletion during heart valve surgery? A randomized controlled trial (ROLO).,"Espeed Khoshbin, Sally Spencer, Laurence Solomon, Augustine Tang, Stephen Clark, Elizabeth Stokes, Sarah Wordsworth, Lucy Dabner, Julia Edwards, Barnaby Reeves, Chris Rogers, Espeed Khoshbinet al.",2021 Mar 26,J Cardiothorac Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33771192/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) adversely affects outcomes after cardiac surgery. A major mediator of AKI is the activation of leukocytes through exposure to the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. We evaluate the use of leukodepletion filters throughout bypass to protect against post-operative AKI by removing activated leukocytes during cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a single-centre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing the use of leukodepletion versus a standard arterial filter throughout bypass. Elective adult patients undergoing heart valve surgery with or without concomitant procedures were investigated. The primary clinical outcome measured was the development of AKI according to the KDIGO criteria. Secondary measures included biomarkers of renal tubular damage (urinary Retinol Binding Protein and Kidney Injury Molecule-1), glomerular kidney injury (urinary Micro Albumin and serum Cystatin C) and urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin, as well as the length of hospital stay and quality of life measures through EQ-5D-5L questionnaires.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The ROLO trial randomized 64 participants with a rate of recruitment higher than anticipated (57% achieved, 40% anticipated). The incidence of AKI was greater in the leukodepletion filter group (44% versus 23%, risk difference 21, 95% CI - 2 to 44%). This clinical finding was supported by biomarker levels especially by a tendency toward glomerular insult at 48 h, demonstrated by a raised serum Cystatin C (mean difference 0.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.23, p = 0.068) in the leukodepleted group. There was however no clear association between the incidence or severity of AKI and length of hospital stay. On average, health related quality of life returned to pre-operative levels in both groups within 3 months of surgery.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Leukocyte depletion during cardiopulmonary bypass does not significantly reduce the incidence of AKI after valvular heart surgery. Other methods to ameliorate renal dysfunction after cardiac surgery need to be investigated.

      Anaesthesiologists might be able to mitigate risk if they know which patients are at greatest risk for postoperative complications. This trial examined the impact of machine learning models on clinician risk assessment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This single-centre, prospective, randomised clinical trial enrolled surgical patients aged ≥18 yr. Anaesthesiologists and nurse anaesthetists providing remote telemedicine support reviewed electronic health records with (assisted group) or without (unassisted group) reviewing machine learning predictions. Clinicians predicted the likelihood of postoperative 30-day all-cause mortality and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) within 7 days. The primary outcome was area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for clinician predictions of mortality and AKI, comparing AUROCs between assisted and unassisted assessments.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We analysed 5071 patients (mean [range] age: 58 [18-100] yr; 52% female) assessed by 89 clinicians. Of these, 98 (2.2%) patients died within 30 days of surgery and 450 (11.1%) patients sustained AKI. Clinician predictions agreed with the models more strongly in the assisted vs unassisted group (weighted kappa 0.75 vs 0.62 for death, mean difference: 0.13 [95% CI 0.10-0.17]; and 0.79 vs 0.54 for AKI, mean difference: 0.25 [95% CI 0.21-0.29]). Clinical prediction of death was similar between the assisted (AUROC 0.793) and unassisted (AUROC 0.780) groups (mean difference: 0.013 [95% CI -0.070 to 0.097]; P=0.76). Prediction of AKI had an AUROC of 0.734 in the assisted group vs 0.688 in the unassisted group (difference 0.046 [95% CI -0.003 to 0.091]; P=0.06).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Clinician performance was not improved by machine learning assistance. Further work is needed to clarify the role of machine learning in real-time perioperative risk stratification.

Acute kidney injury increases the risk of end-stage renal disease after cardiac surgery in an Asian population: a prospective cohort study.,"Sophia Tsong Huey Chew, Roderica Rui Ge Ng, Weiling Liu, Khuan Yew Chow, Lian Kah Ti, Sophia Tsong Huey Chewet al.",2017 Feb 13,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28193259/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The long-term association between AKI and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in an Asian population is unknown. Given the high prevalence of diabetes and a younger age of presentation for cardiac surgery, it is important to track this progression of kidney disease. Therefore, we studied the long-term risk of ESRD and mortality in our Asian patients who developed AKI after cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      With ethics approval, we prospectively recruited 3008 patients who underwent cardiac surgery in Singapore between 2008 and 2012, and followed them up till 2014. ESRD and mortality information were obtained from the Singapore Renal Registry and Singapore Registry of Births and Deaths respectively. AKI was defined using the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria, and ESRD was defined as stage 5 chronic kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze associations between AKI and the primary outcome of ESRD and the secondary outcome of death.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The AKI incidence was 29.1%. During a mean follow-up of 4.4 ± 2.8 years, 0.9% developed ESRD. The hazard ratio (HR) for developing ESRD was 4.7 (95% C.I. = 1.736-12.603, p = 0.002) for AKIN stage 1 patients, and 5.8 (95% C.I. = 1.769-18.732, p = 0.004) for AKIN stage 2 and 3 patients; while the HR for mortality was 1.7 (95% C.I. = 1.165-2.571, p = 0.007) for AKIN stage 1 patients, and 2.5 (95% C.I. = 1.438-4.229, p < 0.001) for AKIN stage 2 and 3 patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      AKI is associated with ESRD and mortality after cardiac surgery in our Asian population. The trajectory from AKI to ESRD is rapid within 5 years of cardiac surgery. A concerted periodic follow-up assessment is advocated for AKI patients post-cardiac surgery."
Effects of 20% albumin infusion therapy during liver transplantation on plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level: A randomized controlled trial.,"Doyeon Kim, Jeayoun Kim, Sangbin Han, Hyunjoo Jung, Hyung-Doo Park, Justin S Ko, Mi Sook Gwak, Gaab Soo Kim, Doyeon Kimet al.",2023 Aug 1,Liver Transpl,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36749856/,No keywords found,"The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) after liver transplantation was lower in patients with serum albumin levels ≥3.0 mg/dL during surgery. We tested whether intraoperative infusion of 20% albumin affects neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) level, a reliable indicator of AKI. We randomly assigned 134 patients undergoing liver transplantation into albumin group (n=70, 20% albumin 200 mL) and the control group (n=66, crystalloid solution 200 mL). The 2 study fluids were infused at 100 mL/h from the start of the anhepatic phase. The primary outcome was plasma NGAL level at 1 hour after graft reperfusion. Albumin level at the start of graft reperfusion was significantly greater in albumin group than in the control group [2.9 (2.4-3.3) g/dL vs. 2.3 (2.0-2.7) g/dL, p <0.001]. The NGAL level at 1 hour after graft reperfusion was not significantly different between the 2 groups [100.2 (66.7-138.8) ng/mL vs. 92.9 (70.8-120.6) ng/mL, p =0.46], and the AKI risk was not either (63.9% vs. 67.8%, adjusted p =0.73). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding hospital readmission within 30 days/90 days after transplantation (32.6% vs. 41.5%, adjusted p =0.19 and 55.0% vs. 55.7%, adjusted p =0.87). Graft survival probability at 30 days/90 days/1 year after transplantation was 90.0%/84.3%/78.6% in albumin group and 97.0%/90.9%/89.4% in the control group [HR=1.6 (0.6-4.0), adjusted p =0.31]. In conclusion, intraoperative infusion of 20% albumin 200 mL increased the albumin level but failed to maintain serum albumin ≥3.0 mg/dL during surgery. The hypertonic albumin therapy did not significantly affect plasma NGAL level and clinical outcomes including AKI."
High dietary salt intake increases urinary NGAL excretion and creatinine clearance in healthy young adults.,"Alex M Barnett, Matthew C Babcock, Joseph C Watso, Kamila U Migdal, Orlando M Gutiérrez, William B Farquhar, Austin T Robinson, Alex M Barnettet al.",2022 Apr 1,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35157527/,"clinical trial, creatinine clearance, dietary sodium, kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, sodium chloride.","In rodents and older patients with elevated blood pressure (BP), high dietary sodium increases excretion of biomarkers of kidney injury, but it is unclear whether this effect occurs in healthy young adults. The purpose of this study was to determine whether short-term high dietary salt increases urinary excretion of the kidney injury biomarkers neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) in healthy young adults. Twenty participants participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. For 10 days each, participants were asked to consume salt (3,900 mg sodium) or placebo capsules. We measured BP during each visit, obtained 24-h urine samples for measurements of electrolytes, NGAL, and KIM-1, and assessed creatinine clearance. Compared with placebo, salt loading increased daily urinary sodium excretion (placebo: 130.3 ± 62.4 mmol/24 h vs. salt: 287.2 ± 72.0 mmol/24 h, P < 0.01). There was no difference in mean arterial BP (placebo: 77 ± 7 mmHg vs. salt: 77 ± 6 mmHg, P = 0.83) between conditions. However, salt loading increased the urinary NGAL excretion rate (placebo: 59.8 ± 44.4 ng/min vs. salt: 80.8 ± 49.5 ng/min, P < 0.01) and increased creatinine clearance (placebo: 110.5 ± 32.9 mL/min vs. salt: 145.0 ± 24.9 mL/min, P < 0.01). Urinary KIM-1 excretion was not different between conditions. In conclusion, in healthy young adults 10 days of dietary salt loading increased creatinine clearance and increased urinary excretion of the kidney injury biomarker marker NGAL but not KIM-1.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In healthy young adults, 10 days of dietary salt loading increased creatinine clearance and increased urinary excretion of the kidney injury biomarker marker neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin despite no change in resting blood pressure."
Development and validation of prognostic nomogram for cirrhotic patients with acute kidney injury upon ICU admission.,"Tianbao Liao#, Yanyan Lu#, Tingting Su, Liyuan Bei, Xian Li, Yang Lu, Shuang Ren, Lina Huang, Lu-Huai Feng, Tianbao Liaoet al.",2024 Jan,Intern Emerg Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37796371/,"Acute kidney injury, Intensive care unit, Model, Nomogram, Prognosis.","This study aims to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram that accurately predicts the short-term survival rate of cirrhotic patients with acute kidney damage (AKI) upon ICU admission. For this purpose, we examined the admission data of 3060 cirrhosis patients with AKI from 2008 to 2019 in the MIMIC-IV database. All included patients were randomly assigned to derivation and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. The derivation cohort used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model to identify independent predictors of AKI. A prognostic nomogram was constructed via multivariate logistic regression analysis in the derivation cohort and subsequently verified in the validation cohort. Nomogram's discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility were evaluated using the C-index, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 2138 patients were enrolled in the derivation cohort, with a median follow-up period of 15 days, a median survival time of 41 days, and a death rate of 568 patients (26.6%). The cumulative survival rates at 15 and 30 days were 75.8% and 57.5%, respectively. The results of the multivariate analysis indicated that advanced AKI stage, use of vasoactive drugs, advanced age, lower levels of ALB, lower mean sBp, longer INR, and longer PT were all independent risk factors that significantly influenced the all-cause mortality of cirrhosis patients with AKI (all p < 0.01). The C-indices for the derivation and the validation cohorts were 0.821 (95% CI 0.800-0.842) and 0.831 (95% CI 0.810-0.852), respectively. The model's calibration plot demonstrated high consistency between predicted and actual probabilities. Furthermore, the DCA showed that the nomogram was clinically valuable. Therefore, the developed and internally validated prognostic nomogram exhibited favorable discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility in forecasting the 15-day and 30-day survival rates of cirrhosis patients with AKI upon admission to the ICU."
Decreased renal perfusion during acute kidney injury in critical COVID-19 assessed by magnetic resonance imaging: a prospective case control study.,"Tomas Luther#, Per Eckerbom#, Eleanor Cox, Miklos Lipcsey, Sara Bülow, Michael Hultström, Francisco Martinez Torrente, Jan Weis, Fredrik Palm, Susan Francis, Robert Frithiof#, Per Liss#, Tomas Lutheret al.",2022 Sep 1,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36050748/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Renal hypoperfusion has been suggested to contribute to the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical COVID-19. However, limited data exist to support this. We aim to investigate the differences in renal perfusion, oxygenation and water diffusion using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in critically ill COVID-19 patients with and without AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective case-control study where patients without prior kidney disease treated in intensive care for respiratory failure due to COVID-19 were examined. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Creatinine criteria were used for group allocation. Main comparisons were tested using Mann-Whitney U test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nineteen patients were examined, ten with AKI and nine without AKI. Patients with AKI were examined in median 1 [0-2] day after criteria fulfillment. Age and baseline Plasma-Creatinine were similar in both groups. Total renal blood flow was lower in patients with AKI compared with patients without (median 645 quartile range [423-753] vs. 859 [746-920] ml/min, p = 0.037). Regional perfusion was reduced in both cortex (76 [51-112] vs. 146 [123-169] ml/100 g/min, p = 0.015) and medulla (28 [18-47] vs. 47 [38-73] ml/100 g/min, p = 0.03). Renal venous saturation was similar in both groups (72% [64-75] vs. 72% [63-84], ns.), as was regional oxygenation (R2*) in cortex (17 [16-19] vs. 17 [16-18] 1/s, ns.) and medulla (29 [24-39] vs. 27 [23-29] 1/s, ns.).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In critically ill COVID-19 patients with AKI, the total, cortical and medullary renal blood flows were reduced compared with similar patients without AKI, whereas no differences in renal oxygenation were demonstrable in this setting.

"Comparison of two delayed strategies for renal replacement therapy initiation for severe acute kidney injury (AKIKI 2): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled trial.","Stéphane Gaudry, David Hajage, Laurent Martin-Lefevre, Saïd Lebbah, Guillaume Louis, Sébastien Moschietto, Dimitri Titeca-Beauport, Béatrice La Combe, Bertrand Pons, Nicolas de Prost, Sébastien Besset, Alain Combes, Adrien Robine, Marion Beuzelin, Julio Badie, Guillaume Chevrel, Julien Bohé, Elisabeth Coupez, Nicolas Chudeau, Saber Barbar, Christophe Vinsonneau, Jean-Marie Forel, Didier Thevenin, Eric Boulet, Karim Lakhal, Nadia Aissaoui, Steven Grange, Marc Leone, Guillaume Lacave, Saad Nseir, Florent Poirson, Julien Mayaux, Karim Asehnoune, Guillaume Geri, Kada Klouche, Guillaume Thiery, Laurent Argaud, Bertrand Rozec, Cyril Cadoz, Pascal Andreu, Jean Reignier, Jean-Damien Ricard, Jean-Pierre Quenot, Didier Dreyfuss, Stéphane Gaudryet al.",2021 Apr 3,Lancet,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33812488/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Delaying renal replacement therapy (RRT) for some time in critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury and no severe complication is safe and allows optimisation of the use of medical devices. Major uncertainty remains concerning the duration for which RRT can be postponed without risk. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that a more-delayed initiation strategy would result in more RRT-free days, compared with a delayed strategy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was an unmasked, multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled trial done in 39 intensive care units in France. We monitored critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury (defined as Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 3) until they had oliguria for more than 72 h or a blood urea nitrogen concentration higher than 112 mg/dL. Patients were then randomly assigned (1:1) to either a strategy (delayed strategy) in which RRT was started just after randomisation or to a more-delayed strategy. With the more-delayed strategy, RRT initiation was postponed until mandatory indication (noticeable hyperkalaemia or metabolic acidosis or pulmonary oedema) or until blood urea nitrogen concentration reached 140 mg/dL. The primary outcome was the number of days alive and free of RRT between randomisation and day 28 and was done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03396757 and is completed.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between May 7, 2018, and Oct 11, 2019, of 5336 patients assessed, 278 patients underwent randomisation; 137 were assigned to the delayed strategy and 141 to the more-delayed strategy. The number of complications potentially related to acute kidney injury or to RRT were similar between groups. The median number of RRT-free days was 12 days (IQR 0-25) in the delayed strategy and 10 days (IQR 0-24) in the more-delayed strategy (p=0·93). In a multivariable analysis, the hazard ratio for death at 60 days was 1·65 (95% CI 1·09-2·50, p=0·018) with the more-delayed versus the delayed strategy. The number of complications potentially related to acute kidney injury or renal replacement therapy did not differ between groups.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      In severe acute kidney injury patients with oliguria for more than 72 h or blood urea nitrogen concentration higher than 112 mg/dL and no severe complication that would mandate immediate RRT, longer postponing of RRT initiation did not confer additional benefit and was associated with potential harm.

A safe and effective protocol for postdilution hemofiltration with regional citrate anticoagulation.,"Thomas Dimski, Timo Brandenburger, Christian Vollmer, Detlef Kindgen-Milles, Thomas Dimskiet al.",2024 Jul 9,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38982339/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is recommended during continuous renal replacement therapy. Compared to systemic anticoagulation, RCA provides a longer filter lifespan with the risk of metabolic alkalosis and impaired calcium homeostasis. Surprisingly, most RCA protocols are designed for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration. Effective protocols for continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) are rare, although CVVH is a standard treatment for high-molecular-weight clearance. Therefore, we evaluated a new RCA protocol for postdilution CVVH.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a monocentric prospective interventional study to evaluate a new RCA protocol for postdilution CVVH. We recruited surgical patients with stage III acute kidney injury who needed renal replacement therapy. We recorded dialysis and RCA data and hemodynamic and laboratory parameters during treatment sessions of 72 h. The primary endpoint was filter patency at 72 h. The major safety parameters were metabolic alkalosis and severe hypocalcemia at any time.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We included 38 patients who underwent 66 treatment sessions. The mean filter lifespan was 66 ± 12 h, and 44 of 66 (66%) filters were patent at 72 h. After censoring for non-CVVH-related cessation of treatment, 83% of all filters were patent at 72 h. The delivered dialysis dose was 28 ± 5 ml/kgBW/h. The serum levels of creatinine, urea and beta2-microglobulin decreased significantly from day 0 to day 3. Metabolic alkalosis occurred in one patient. An iCa++ below 1.0 mmol/L occurred in four patients. Citrate accumulation did not occur.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We describe a safe, effective, and easy-to-use RCA protocol for postdilution CVVH. This protocol provides a long and sustained filter lifespan without serious adverse effects. The risk of metabolic alkalosis and hypocalcemia is low. Using this protocol, a recommended dialysis dose can be safely administered with effective clearance of low- and middle-molecular-weight molecules.

Effect of Clinical Decision Support With Audit and Feedback on Prevention of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Coronary Angiography: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Matthew T James, Bryan J Har, Benjamin D Tyrrell, Peter D Faris, Zhi Tan, John A Spertus, Stephen B Wilton, William A Ghali, Merril L Knudtson, Tolulope T Sajobi, Neesh I Pannu, Scott W Klarenbach, Michelle M Graham, Matthew T Jameset al.",2022 Sep 6,JAMA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36066520/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Contrast-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) that has been associated with high costs and adverse long-term outcomes.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether a multifaceted intervention is effective for the prevention of AKI after coronary angiography or PCI.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      A stepped-wedge, cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted in Alberta, Canada, that included all invasive cardiologists at 3 cardiac catheterization laboratories who were randomized to various start dates for the intervention between January 2018 and September 2019. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older who underwent nonemergency coronary angiography, PCI, or both; who were not undergoing dialysis; and who had a predicted AKI risk of greater than 5%. Thirty-four physicians performed 7820 procedures among 7106 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Participant follow-up ended in November 2020.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      During the intervention period, cardiologists received educational outreach, computerized clinical decision support on contrast volume and hemodynamic-guided intravenous fluid targets, and audit and feedback. During the control (preintervention) period, cardiologists provided usual care and did not receive the intervention.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was AKI. There were 12 secondary outcomes, including contrast volume, intravenous fluid administration, and major adverse cardiovascular and kidney events. The analyses were conducted using time-adjusted models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 34 participating cardiologists who were divided into 8 clusters by practice group and center, the intervention group included 31 who performed 4327 procedures among 4032 patients (mean age, 70.3 [SD, 10.7] years; 1384 were women [32.0%]) and the control group included 34 who performed 3493 procedures among 3251 patients (mean age, 70.2 [SD, 10.8] years; 1151 were women [33.0%]). The incidence of AKI was 7.2% (310 events after 4327 procedures) during the intervention period and 8.6% (299 events after 3493 procedures) during the control period (between-group difference, -2.3% [95% CI, -0.6% to -4.1%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.72 [95% CI, 0.56 to 0.93]; P = .01). Of 12 prespecified secondary outcomes, 8 showed no significant difference. The proportion of procedures in which excessive contrast volumes were used was reduced to 38.1% during the intervention period from 51.7% during the control period (between-group difference, -12.0% [95% CI, -14.4% to -9.4%]; OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.90]; P = .002). The proportion of procedures in eligible patients in whom insufficient intravenous fluid was given was reduced to 60.8% during the intervention period from 75.1% during the control period (between-group difference, -15.8% [95% CI, -19.7% to -12.0%]; OR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.87]; P = .002). There were no significant between-group differences in major adverse cardiovascular events or major adverse kidney events.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among cardiologists randomized to an intervention including clinical decision support with audit and feedback, patients undergoing coronary procedures during the intervention period were less likely to develop AKI compared with those treated during the control period, with a time-adjusted absolute risk reduction of 2.3%. Whether this intervention would show efficacy outside this study setting requires further investigation.

"Incidence, determinants and impact of acute kidney injury in patients with diabetes mellitus and multivessel disease undergoing coronary revascularization: Results from the FREEDOM trial.","Yaron Arbel, Valentin Fuster, Usman Baber, Taye H Hamza, F S Siami, Michael E Farkouh, Yaron Arbelet al.",2019 Oct 15:293:197-202.,Int J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31230933/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The incidence and prognostic significance of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with diabetes mellitus and multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing coronary revascularization is not well known. The current analysis included patients randomized to PCI vs. CABG as part of the FREEDOM trial. We sought to examine the impact of AKI and its predictors in diabetic patients with multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing PCI vs. CABG.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a pre-specified subgroup analysis of the FREEDOM trial to examine the incidence, correlates and impact of AKI according to revascularization strategy. AKI predictors were identified using multivariable logistic regression and associations between AKI and outcomes were examined using Cox regression. The primary endpoint was the composite occurrence of all-cause death, stroke or myocardial infarction at 5 years of follow-up.
    


          Results:
        
      
      KI occurred more frequently in patients following CABG (15.6%) compared with PCI (9.1%) (p < 0.001). AKI was associated with a higher risk for major cardiovascular events (MACE) at 5 years (34.6% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.001), an effect that remained large and significant irrespective of CABG (HR = 2.18 95% CI 1.44-3.31, p ≤0.001) or PCI (HR = 2.08 95% CI 1.35-3.21, p < 0.0001). There was a non-significant interaction (p-value = 0.89) between the revascularization method and AKI, supporting that AKI is a significant risk factor in both revascularization methods.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although risk for AKI was higher in patients undergoing CABG, the impact of AKI on MACE was substantial irrespective of revascularization strategy. Preventive strategies to identify patients at risk for AKI are warranted to mitigate the long-term effects of this complication."
Risk factors for acute kidney injury at presentation among children with CNS malaria: a case control study.,"Derby Tembo, Suzanna Mwanza, Chisambo Mwaba, Ifunanya Dallah, Somwe Wa Somwe, Karl B Seydel, Gretchen L Birbeck, Derby Temboet al.",2022 Nov 1,Malar J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36316704/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Recent research has established that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common problem in severe paediatric malaria. Limited access to kidney diagnostic studies in the low resources settings where malaria is common has constrained research on this important problem.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Enrolment data from an ongoing clinical trial of antipyretics in children with central nervous system (CNS) malaria, CNS malaria being malaria with seizures or coma, was used to identify risk factors for AKI at presentation. Children 2-11 years old with CNS malaria underwent screening and enrollment assessments which included demographic and anthropomorphic data, clinical details regarding the acute illness, and laboratory studies including creatinine (Cr), quantitative parasite count (qPC), quantitative histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2), lactate, and bilirubin levels. Children with a screening Cr > 106 µmol/l were excluded from the study due to the potential nephrotoxic effects of the study drug. To identify risk factors for AKI at the time of admission, children who were enrolled in the study were categorized as having AKI using estimates of their baseline (i.e. before this acute illness) kidney function and creatinine at enrollment applying the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) 2012 guidelines. Logistic regressions and a multivariate model were used to identify clinical and demographic risk factors for AKI at presentation among those children enrolled in the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      465 children were screened, 377 were age-appropriate with CNS malaria, 22 (5.8%) were excluded due to Cr > 106 µmol/l, and 209 were enrolled. Among the 209, AKI using KDIGO criteria was observed in 134 (64.1%). One child required dialysis during recovery. Risk factors for AKI in both the logistic regression and multivariate models included: hyperpyrexia (OR 3.36; 95% CI 1.39-8.12) and age with older children being less likely to have AKI (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.62-0.84).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      AKI is extremely common among children presenting with CNS malaria. Hyperpyrexia with associated dehydration may contribute to the AKI or may simply be a marker for a more inflammatory systemic response that is also affecting the kidney. Appropriate fluid management in children with CNS malaria and AKI may be challenging since generous hydration to support kidney recovery could worsen malaria-induced cerebral oedema in this critically ill population.

Dietary restriction for prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary angiography: a randomized controlled trial.,"Franziska Grundmann, Roman-Ulrich Müller, Karla Johanna Ruth Hoyer-Allo, Martin Richard Späth, Eva Passmann, Ingrid Becker, Roman Pfister, Stephan Baldus, Thomas Benzing, Volker Burst, Franziska Grundmannet al.",2020 Mar 23,Sci Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32251303/,No keywords found,"Short-term dietary restriction (DR) may prevent organ damage from ischemic or toxic insults in animals, but clear evidence in humans is missing. While especially intraarterial administration of contrast media represents a cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury (AKI), targeted preventive strategies are not available. This trial investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of pre-interventional DR for preventing AKI in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients were randomized to receive a formula diet containing 60% of daily energy requirement (DR group) or ad-libitum food during the 4-day-interval before PCI. Primary endpoint was change of serum creatinine 48 h after PCI (Δcreatinine). Further analyses included incidence of AKI and safety evaluation. Δcreatinine post PCI in the DR group vs. the control group did not show any difference (DR: 0.03(-0.15,0.14)mg/dL vs. control: 0.09(-0.03,0.22)mg/dL;p = 0.797). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant beneficial impact of DR in patients that received ≤100 ml of contrast agent (DR n = 26: Δcreatinine -0.03(-0.20,0.08)mg/dL vs. control n = 24: Δcreatinine 0.10(-0.08,0.24)mg/dL; p = 0.041) and in patients with ≤2 risk factors for AKI (DR: n = 27; Δcreatinine -0.01(-0.18,0.07)mg/dL vs. control n = 31: Δcreatinine 0.09(-0.03,0.16)mg/dl; p = 0.030). Although the primary endpoint was not met, the results of this trial suggest a beneficial impact of DR in low-to-moderate risk patients."
Distribution of Acute and Chronic Kidney Disease Across Clinical Phenotypes for Sepsis.,"Luca Molinari, Gaspar Del Rio-Pertuz, Priyanka Priyanka, Ali Smith, Joseph C Maggiore, Jason Kennedy, Hernando Gomez, Christopher W Seymour, John A Kellum                              ;, ProCESS and ProGReSS-AKI Investigators, Luca Molinariet al.",2024 Sep,Chest,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38462074/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Sepsis is the most common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. Four phenotypes (α, β, γ, δ) for sepsis, which have different outcomes and responses to treatment, were described using routine clinical data in the electronic health record.
    


          Research question:
        
      
      Do the frequencies of AKI, acute kidney disease (AKD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and AKI on CKD differ by sepsis phenotype?
    


          Study design and methods:
        
      
      This was a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of early resuscitation, including patients with septic shock at 31 sites. After excluding patients with end-stage kidney disease and missing data, we determined frequencies of the following clinical outcomes: AKI (defined within 24 h as Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stages 2 or 3 or stage 1 with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 × insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 value of > 2.0), CKD, and AKD (persistence of AKI at any stage on day 7 after enrollment) across four phenotypes. We performed multivariable logistic regression to assess the risk-adjusted association between development of AKI and AKD and phenotype.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 1,090 eligible patients, 543 patients (50%) had AKI. Across phenotypes, the frequencies of AKI varied, being highest in the δ and β phenotypes (78% and 71%, respectively) and the lowest in the α phenotype (26%; P < .001). AKD occurred most often in the δ phenotype (41%) and least often in the α phenotype (8%; P < .001). The highest frequencies of CKD and of AKI on CKD were found in the β phenotype (53% and 38% respectively; P < .001 for both). In the multivariable logistic regression models (α phenotype as reference), δ phenotype showed the strongest association with AKI (OR, 12.33; 95% CI, 7.81-19.47; P < .001) and AKD (OR, 9.18; 95% CI, 5.44-15.51; P < .001).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      The rates of AKI and AKD differed across clinical sepsis phenotypes and are more common among patients with phenotypes β and δ. Phenotype β showed a higher level of underlying CKD that predisposed patients to new AKI. The α and γ phenotypes showed lower frequencies of AKI and less progression to AKD."
Clinical Assessment of Perfusion Techniques During Surgical Repair of Coarctation of Aorta With Aortic Arch Hypoplasia in Neonates: A Pilot Prospective Randomized Study.,"Y Y Kulyabin, A V Bogachev-Prokophiev, I A Soynov, A Y Omelchenko, A V Zubritskiy, Y N Gorbatykh, Y Y Kulyabinet al.",2020,Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446921/,"Acute kidney injury, Antegrade cerebral perfusion, Aortic arch, Congenital.","We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of 3 perfusion methods primarily used in aortic arch reconstruction in infants, namely, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, and double arterial cannulation. Forty-five infants with aortic arch obstruction and biventricular anatomy were enrolled in this pilot prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT02835703). Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups according to the perfusion strategy (deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, n = 15; selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, n = 15; double arterial cannulation, n = 15). The primary composite endpoint was the incidence of adverse events in the early postoperative period (acute kidney injury [KDIGO criteria], new brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and in-hospital mortality). The secondary endpoints were intensive care unit length of stay, vasoactive-inotropic score index, and cardiopulmonary bypass duration. All patients underwent aortic arch reconstruction under cardiopulmonary bypass and were monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy during surgery. No significant differences in the baseline characteristics and cardiopulmonary bypass duration were observed among the groups. The incidence of unfavorable events was lower in the double arterial cannulation group (P = 0.041). Acute kidney injury was observed in 8, 6, and 5 patients from the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, and double arterial cannulation groups, respectively (P = 0.64). Twelve patients from the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest group had new brain MRI findings (P = 0.019). There were 5 in-hospital deaths with no significant difference among the groups (P = 0.70). The ""head"" and ""lumbar"" values on near-infrared spectroscopy during aortic arch reconstruction were significantly higher in the selective antegrade cerebral perfusion and double arterial cannulation groups than in the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest group. Patients in the double arterial cannulation group had a significantly lower vasoactive-inotropic score index 24 hours postoperatively than the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest group (P = 0.03). Vasoactive-inotropic score index >12 was found to be a risk factor for acute kidney injury and early mortality. Continuous regional perfusion during aortic arch reconstruction decreases the risk of new brain MRI findings in infants and the need for postoperative inotropic support. Although values of near-infrared spectroscopy during the procedure were significantly higher with continuous perfusion strategies, these methods do not reduce the acute kidney injury incidence compared to that with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Double arterial cannulation significantly reduces the need for inotropic support."
Pediatric reference ranges for acute kidney injury biomarkers.,"Michael R Bennett, Edward Nehus, Christopher Haffner, Qing Ma, Prasad Devarajan, Michael R Bennettet al.",2015 Apr,Pediatr Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25348707/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Novel urinary biomarkers are useful for the prediction of acute kidney injury (AKI). Most promising are the urine markers NGAL, IL-18, KIM-1, and LFABP. Each of these has shown considerable promise diagnosing AKI earlier than serum creatinine (Scr) using disease controls. We set out to determine reference levels of these markers in a healthy pediatric population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Urine was collected from 368 healthy children and assayed for NGAL, IL-18, KIM-1, and LFABP using commercially available kits or assay materials. Analysis of biomarkers by linear regression and according to age groups (3-<5 years; 5-<10; 10-<15; 15-<18) was performed to determine if biomarker levels differed with age and gender.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median values were: NGAL (6.6 ng/ml; IQR 2.8-17), IL-18 (21.6 pg/ml; IQR 13.6-32.9), KIM-1 (410 pg/ml; IQR 226-703), LFABP (3.4 ng/ml; IQR 1.6-6.0). Significant gender differences were found with NGAL and IL-18 and significant age differences were found with all markers. 95th percentile values for each marker varied with age and gender greater than median values.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This is the largest pediatric reference range study for the urinary measurement of NGAL, IL-18, KIM-1, and LFABP and highlights age and gender differences in these markers. This information is essential for rational interpretation of studies and clinical trials utilizing these emerging AKI biomarkers."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs frequently after cardiac surgery. Levosimendan might reduce the incidence of AKI in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The authors investigated whether levosimendan administration could reduce AKI incidence in a high-risk cardiac surgical population.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Post hoc analysis of a multicenter randomized trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Cardiac surgery operating rooms and intensive care units of 14 centers in 3 countries.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      The study comprised 90 patients who underwent mitral valve surgery with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and perioperative myocardial dysfunction.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were assigned randomly to receive levosimendan (0.025-0.2 μg/kg/min) or placebo in addition to standard inotropic treatment.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Forty-six patients were assigned to receive levosimendan and 44 to receive placebo. Postoperative AKI occurred in 14 (30%) patients in the levosimendan group versus 23 (52%) in the placebo group (absolute difference -21.8; 95% confidence interval -41.7 to -1.97; p = 0.035). The incidence of major complications also was lower (18 [39%]) in the levosimendan group versus that in the placebo group (29 [66%]) (absolute difference -26.8 [-46.7 to -6.90]; p = 0.011). A trend toward lower serum creatinine at intensive care unit discharge was observed in the levosimendan group (1.18 [0.99-1.49] mg/dL) versus that in the placebo group (1.39 [1.05-1.76] mg/dL) (95% confidence interval -0.23 [-0.49 to 0.01]; p = 0.07).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Levosimendan may improve renal outcome in cardiac surgery patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing mitral valve surgery who develop perioperative myocardial dysfunction. Results of this exploratory analysis should be investigated in future properly designed randomized controlled trials."
Free Hemoglobin Ratio as a Novel Biomarker of Acute Kidney Injury After On-Pump Cardiac Surgery: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Jie Hu, Emanuele Rezoagli, Francesco Zadek, Edward A Bittner, Chong Lei, Lorenzo Berra, Jie Huet al.",2021 Jun 1,Anesth Analg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33481401/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with a high risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). Due to limitations of current diagnostic strategies, we sought to determine whether free hemoglobin (fHb) ratio (ie, levels of fHb at the end of CPB divided by baseline fHb) could predict AKI after on-pump cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of nitric oxide (intervention) versus nitrogen (control) on AKI after cardiac surgery (NCT01802619). A total of 110 adult patients in the control arm were included. First, we determined whether fHb ratio was associated with AKI via multivariable analysis. Second, we verified whether fHb ratio could predict AKI and incorporation of fHb ratio could improve predictive performance at an early stage, compared with prediction using urinary biomarkers alone. We conducted restricted cubic spline in logistic regression for model development. We determined the predictive performance, including area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) and calibration (calibration plot and accuracy, ie, number of correct predictions divided by total number of predictions). We also used AUC test, likelihood ratio test, and net reclassification index (NRI) to compare the predictive performance between competing models (ie, fHb ratio versus neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL], N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase [NAG], and kidney injury molecule-1 [KIM-1], respectively, and incorporation of fHb ratio with NGAL, NAG, and KIM-1 versus urinary biomarkers alone), if applicable.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data stratified by median fHb ratio showed that subjects with an fHb ratio >2.23 presented higher incidence of AKI (80.0% vs 49.1%; P = .001), more need of renal replacement therapy (10.9% vs 0%; P = .036), and higher in-hospital mortality (10.9% vs 0%; P = .036) than subjects with an fHb ratio ≤2.23. fHb ratio was associated with AKI after adjustment for preestablished factors. fHb ratio outperformed urinary biomarkers with the highest AUC of 0.704 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.592-0.804) and accuracy of 0.714 (95% CI, 0.579-0.804). Incorporation of fHb ratio achieved better discrimination (AUC test, P = .012), calibration (likelihood ratio test, P < .001; accuracy, 0.740 [95% CI, 0.617-0.832] vs 0.632 [95% CI, 0.477-0.748]), and significant prediction increment (NRI, 0.638; 95% CI, 0.269-1.008; P < .001) at an early stage, compared with prediction using urinary biomarkers alone.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Results from this exploratory, hypothesis-generating retrospective, observational study shows that fHb ratio at the end of CPB might be used as a novel, widely applicable biomarker for AKI. The use of fHb ratio might help for an early detection of AKI, compared with prediction based only on urinary biomarkers."
Treatment Outcome of Combined Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration and Hemoperfusion in Acute Paraquat Poisoning: A Prospective Controlled Trial.,"Changbin Li, Dayong Hu, Wen Xue, Xinhua Li, Zhen Wang, Zisheng Ai, Yaxiang Song, Xinying Liu, Jiafeng Cheng, Shuling Fan, Limin Zhao, Liya Wang, Chandra Mohan, Ai Peng, Changbin Liet al.",2018 Jan,Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29116999/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      To investigate whether combined continuous venovenous hemofiltration and hemoperfusion among paraquat-poisoned patients would improve survival.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Prospective, controlled interventional study over 4 years.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Single, tertiary, academic medical center.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      We recruited patients admitted to Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital within 48 hours after paraquat ingestion. Exclusions were under 14 years old, ingestion of paraquat with other toxicants, pregnant, a history of chronic pulmonary disease, psychosis, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes with impaired liver or renal function.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      All patients were assigned to receive continuous venovenous hemofiltration with hemoperfusion therapy (continuous venovenous hemofiltration group) and to receive conventional therapy (conventional group). The study outcomes were death from any cause within 90 days after paraquat ingestion and the frequencies of hypoxia, acute kidney injury, or adverse events.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Of the 110 enrolled patients, 59 were assigned to continuous venovenous hemofiltration group and 51 to conventional group. The two groups had similar baseline demographics and clinical features. At 90 days after paraquat ingestion, 19 of 59 patients (32.2%) in the continuous venovenous hemofiltration group and 29 of 51 patients (56.9%) in the conventional group had died (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24-0.76; p = 0.004). In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models controlling for baseline characteristics, combined continuous venovenous hemofiltration and hemoperfusion was independently associated with reduced risk of death compared with conventional therapy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.19-0.64; p = 0.001). Patients in the continuous venovenous hemofiltration group, as compared to the conventional group, had a reduced occurrence rate of hypoxia (40.7% vs 72.5%; p = 0.001) and of acute kidney injury (59.3% vs 78.4%; p = 0.03). Hypophosphatemia and thrombocytopenia were more common in the continuous venovenous hemofiltration group (p < 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with paraquat poisoning, treatment with combined continuous venovenous hemofiltration and hemoperfusion significantly improved 90-day survival rates."
A Predictive Model for Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Elderly Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.,"Hang Qiu, Yinghua Zhu, Guoqi Shen, Zhen Wang, Wenhua Li, Hang Qiuet al.",2023 Mar 22:18:453-465.,Clin Interv Aging,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36987461/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Development and validation of a nomogram model to predict the risk of Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury (CI-AKI) after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in elderly patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Retrospective analysis of 542 elderly (≥65 years) STEMI patients undergoing emergency PCI in our hospital from January 2019 to June 2022, with all patients randomized to the training cohort (70%; n=380) and the validation cohort (30%; n=162). Univariate analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine independent risk factors for developing CI-AKI in elderly STEMI patients. R software is used to generate a nomogram model. The predictive power of the nomogram model was compared with the Mehran score 2. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the prediction model's discrimination, calibration, and clinical validity, respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The nomogram model consisted of five variables: diabetes mellitus (DM), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), Systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and highly sensitive C-reactive protein(hsCRP). In the training cohort, the AUC is 0.84 (95% CI: 0.790-0.890), and in the validation cohort, it is 0.844 (95% CI: 0.762-0.926). The nomogram model has better predictive ability than Mehran score 2. Based on the calibration curves, the predicted and observed values of the nomogram model were in good agreement between the training and validation cohort. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve showed that the nomogram prediction model has good clinical utility.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The established nomogram model can intuitively and specifically screen high-risk groups with a high degree of discrimination and accuracy and has a specific predictive value for CI-AKI occurrence in elderly STEMI patients after PCI."
The efficacy of biomarkers in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury secondary to liver cirrhosis.,"Yuwei Yang, Bin Ge, Yan Liu, Jiafu Feng, Yuwei Yanget al.",2021 Apr 9,Medicine (Baltimore),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33832138/,No keywords found,"This study is to investigate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin C (CysC) and creatinine in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to liver cirrhosis.A total of 825 patients (including 540 liver cirrhosis patients and 285 healthy controls) were enrolled. Liver cirrhosis patients were further subdivided into AKI secondary to liver cirrhosis group (AKI group, 210 patients) and simple liver cirrhosis group (LC group, 330 patients). Serum NGAL/urine NGAL (sNGAL/uNGAL), and serum creatinine (sCr) levels as well as estimated glomerular filtration rates were measured. The diagnostic performances of these indicators in AKI secondary to liver cirrhosis were evaluated.The levels of sNGAL, uNGAL, CysC and sCr in the AKI group were significantly higher than those of LC and healthy control groups. However, the eGFR and c-aGFR of AKI group were significantly lower. With the progression of AKI (AKI-S1→AKI-S2→AKI-S3), the levels of sNGAL, uNGAL, CysC and sCr increased gradually, while the levels of c-aGFR and eGFR decreased gradually. The sNGAL, uNGAL and CysC were positively correlated with sCr (r = 0.638, 0.635, and 0.650), but negatively correlated with c-aGFR (r = -0.617, -0.606 and -0.655). However, eGFR had a negative correlation with sCr (r = -0.711), but a positive correlation with c-aGFR (r = 0.736). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve for uNGAL was the largest (0.976), followed by sNGAL (0.967). The diagnostic efficacy of uNGAL and sNGAL in AKI group were 0.907 and 0.870, and the risk degrees were OR = 54.524 and 5.115, respectively.NGAL might perform better than sCr and CysC in the diagnosis of AKI secondary to liver cirrhosis, while uNGAL might be a better indicator than sNGAL in AKI diagnosis."

          Design:
        
      
      Prospective randomized study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      University teaching hospital.
    


          Animals:
        
      
      Eighteen healthy Beagle dogs.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      In group 1 (n = 6), NM was administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/h during IHD for 5 hours. In group 2 (n = 6), NM was administered at a low dose of 0.25 mg/kg/h during IHD. In group 3 (n = 6), which was the control group, unfractionated heparin (UFH) was administered during IHD. The evaluated parameters included: the amount of residual blood clots in the blood chamber and arterial side of the dialyzer; the levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets; and the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT).
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Groups 1 and 2 successfully completed IHD without serious coagulation in the extracorporeal circulation. The residual blood clotting in the blood chamber and arterial side of the dialyzer did not significantly differ in groups 1 and 2 compared to group 3 (group 1 vs group 3, P = 1.000; and group 2 vs group 3, P = 1.000). No significant differences were observed between pre- and posttreatment PTs in groups 1 (P = 0.476) and 2 (P = 0.597), between pre- and posttreatment aPTTs in groups 1 (P = 0.983) and 2 (P = 0.977), and between pre- and posttreatment ACT in groups 1 (P = 0.282) and 2 (P = 0.401). In group 3, a significant elevation of ACT was observed at the posttest (P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results of this study in healthy Beagle dogs suggest that NM at 0.25 mg/kg/h may be a valid alternative to UFH for IHD. Further studies are needed in patients at high risk of bleeding."

      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a common complication after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There is conflicting evidence regarding efficacy of nicorandil in CIN prevention. With respect to ranolazine, there is physiological possibility as well as data in animal study regarding its protective effect against CIN; there is, however, no human data till date.
    


          Aim and objectives:
        
      
      To assess the efficacy of nicorandil and ranolazine in preventing CIN. The secondary endpoint was to measure difference in postprocedure acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence across groups. Also, patients were followed up till 6 months for major adverse events.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      This single-center randomized controlled study included 315 patients of coronary artery disease with mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction undergoing elective PCI. Eligible patients were assigned to either nicorandil (n = 105), ranolazine (n = 105) or control group (n = 105) in 1 : 1 : 1 ratio by block randomization. All enrolled patients were given intravenous sodium chloride at rate of 1.0 mL/kg/h (0.5 mL/kg/h for patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <45%) from 6 h before procedure till 12 h after procedure. Iso-osmolar contrast agent (iodixanol) was used for all patients. In addition to hydration, patients in nicorandil group received oral nicorandil (10 mg, 3 times/d) and those in ranolazine group received oral ranolazine (1000 mg, 2 times/d) 1 day before procedure and for 2 days after PCI. Patients in control group received only hydration.

      Total number of CIN was 34 (10.7%), which included 19 (18.1%) in control, 8 (7.6%) in nicorandil and 7 (6.6%) in ranolazine group. There was significant association of CIN reduction across groups ( P = 0.012). On pairwise comparison also, there was significant benefit across control and ranolazine as well as control and nicorandil ( P < 0.025). There was numerically higher incidence of AKI in controls; the difference, however, did not reach statistical significance after applying Bonferroni correction ( P = 0.044). Over 6-month follow-up, adverse events were similar across groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      While this study adds to existing literature that supports role for nicorandil in CIN prevention, the efficacy of ranolazine in protecting against CIN has been demonstrated in humans for the first time."
The Prevention of Contrast Induced Nephropathy by Sarpogrelate: a Prospective Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.,"You Jeong Ki, Sun A Kwon, Hack Lyoung Kim, Jae Bin Seo, Woo Young Chung, You Jeong Kiet al.",2019 Oct 21,J Korean Med Sci,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31625293/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Although some strategies are used for prophylaxis of contrast induced nephropathy, their efficacy is not fully established. Sarpogrelate can relieve vasospasm and have anti-inflammatory action. This study examined whether sarpogrelate reduces the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) or subsequent renal impairment during four weeks after coronary angiography compared with a control group.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seventy-four participants with chronic renal failure were randomly assigned to the sarpogrelate or control group. Patients assigned to the sarpogrelate group received oral saporogelate from 24 hours before contrast exposure up to one month after contrast exposure. The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of CIN within 48 hours after exposure to the contrast agent.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-one subjects in the control group and 35 subjects in the sarpogrelate group were used for the analysis. Cumulative CIN occurred numerically more at 48 hours in the sarpogrelate group and less at one month without statistical significance (11.4% vs. 6.5% at 48 hours and 11.4% vs. 16.1% at one month, respectively). Baseline renal function was similar in both groups, but the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower in the sarpogrelate group at 12 and 48 hours compared with the control group (45.6 vs. 54.7 mL/min/1.73m²; P = 0.023 and 39.9 vs. 50.6 mL/min/1.73m²; P = 0.020, respectively). At one month, the eGFR became comparable between the two groups because the eGFR was aggravated in the control group and maintained in the sarpogrelate group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study failed to demonstrate that sarpogrelate has a renoprotective effect against contrast induced acute kidney injury.

      Cardiac surgery-related acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common postoperative complication that greatly increases morbidity and mortality. There are currently no effective interventions to prevent AKI associated with cardiac surgery. Experimental data have shown that administration of the mineralocorticoid receptor blocker spironolactone prevents renal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion in rats. The objective of this study was to test whether short-term perioperative administration of oral spironolactone could reduce the incidence of AKI in cardiac surgical patients.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.
    


          Setting & participants:
        
      
      Data were collected from April 2014 through July 2015 at the National Heart Institute in Mexico. 233 patients were included; 115 and 118 received spironolactone or placebo, respectively.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Spironolactone or placebo once at a dose of 100mg 12 to 24 hours before surgery and subsequently 3 further doses of 25mg in postoperative days 0, 1, and 2 were administered.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      Patients were followed up for 7 days or until discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary end point was AKI incidence defined by KDIGO criteria. Secondary end points included requirement of renal replacement therapy, ICU length of stay, and ICU mortality. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean age was 53.2±15 years, mean serum creatinine level was 0.9±0.2mg/dL, median Thakar score for estimation of AKI risk was 2 (IQR, 1-3), and 25% had diabetes. The incidence of AKI was higher for the spironolactone group (43% vs 29%; P=0.02). No significant differences were found for secondary end points.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Single center, AKI was mostly driven by AKI stage 1, planned sample size was not achieved, and there was no renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system washout period.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our trial demonstrated that spironolactone was not protective for AKI associated with cardiac surgery and there may be a trend toward risk."

      To determine the effect of dexmedetomidine on acute kidney injury (AKI) following endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) for Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD).
    


          Design:
        
      
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      University Hospital.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      102 TBAD patients undergoing EVAR procedures were enrolled. Patients with dissection involving aortic arch or renal artery were excluded.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to a dexmedetomidine group (intravenous dexmedetomidine 0.4 μg/kg/h immediately after anesthesia induction and 0.1 μg/kg/h after extubation, which was maintained until 24 h) or a normal saline control group.
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI within the first two days after surgery, based on the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. The secondary outcomes included serum cystatin C and estimated glomerular filtration rate on postoperative days 1, 2, and 7, and in-hospital need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Long-term outcomes included RRT and all-cause mortality.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      Ninety-eight patients completed the study (dexmedetomidine, n = 48; control, n = 50). AKIN stage 1 AKI occurred in 3/48 (6.3%) patients receiving dexmedetomidine, compared with 11/50 (22%) patients receiving normal saline (odds ratio = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.89, P = 0.041). This difference remained significant after adjusting for baseline covariates (adjusted odds ratio = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.84; P = 0.028). Dexmedetomidine led to a lower serum cystatin C on postoperative day 1 (median [IQR] mg/L: 1.31 [1.02-1.72] vs. 1.58 [1.28-1.96]). There were no between-group differences in other secondary or long-term outcomes. During the follow-up (median = 28.4 months), 1 patient in the dexmedetomidine group and 3 patients in the control group required RRT.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dexmedetomidine reduced the incidence of AKI in TBAD patients after EVAR procedures. The long-term benefits of dexmedetomidine in this patient population warrant further investigation.

Double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of N-acetylcysteine infusion following live donor liver transplantation.,"Mohammed Abdullatheef Thirunavayakalathil, Christi Titus Varghese, Viju Kumar Bharathan, Biju Chandran, Krishnanunni Nair, Shweta Mallick, Johns Shaji Mathew, Binoj Sivasankara Pillai Thankamony Amma, Ramachandran Narayana Menon, Unnikrishnan Gopalakrishnan, Dinesh Balakrishnan, Othiyil Vayoth Sudheer, Sudhindran Surendran, Mohammed Abdullatheef Thirunavayakalathilet al.",2020 Dec,Hepatol Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33278022/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The role of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in improving outcomes following live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is not well established. We designed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to study the role of NAC infusion in recipients undergoing LDLT.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We assigned 150 patients who underwent LDLT by computer-generated random sequence on 1:1 ratio to either NAC group or placebo group. Patients in the NAC group received NAC infusion which was started at beginning of graft implantation at an initial loading dose of 150 mg/kg/h over 1 h, followed by 12.5 mg/kg/h for 4 h and then at 6.25 mg/kg/h continued for 91 h. Placebo group received normal saline. The primary endpoint was composite occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and early allograft dysfunction (EAD) in the recipient. Secondary endpoints included levels of bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, INR, primary graft non-function, intraoperative bleeding, post-transplant hospital stay and in-hospital mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The composite endpoint did not show any significant difference between the NAC and placebo group (21.3% vs 29.3%, p = 0.35). Peak AST (425.65 IU/L vs 702.24 IU/L, p = 0.02) and peak ALT (406.65 IU/L vs 677.99 IU/L, p = 0.01) levels were significantly lower in the study group. Time to normalization of transaminases was also significantly low in the study group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Perioperative NAC infusion following LDLT resulted in significantly lower postoperative AST and ALT levels. Rapid normalization of transaminases was also observed. This, however, did not translate to improvement in AKI or EAD."
Albuminuria and cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes: Results from the TRACER trial.,"Axel Åkerblom, Robert M Clare, Yuliya Lokhnygina, Lars Wallentin, Claes Held, Frans Van de Werf, David J Moliterno, Uptal D Patel, Sergio Leonardi, Paul W Armstrong, Robert A Harrington, Harvey D White, Philip E Aylward, Kenneth W Mahaffey, Pierluigi Tricoci, Axel Åkerblomet al.",2016 Aug:178:1-8.,Am Heart J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27502846/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Albuminuria is associated with cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. We evaluated albuminuria, alone and in combination with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as a predictor of mortality and CV morbidity in 12,944 patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Baseline serum creatinine and urinary dipsticks were obtained, with albuminuria stratified into no/trace albuminuria, microalbuminuria (≥30 but <300 mg/dL), or macroalbuminuria (≥300 mg/dL). Kaplan-Meier rates and proportional Cox hazards models of CV death, overall mortality, CV death or myocardial infarction (MI), and bleeding were calculated. Incidence of acute kidney injury, identified by adverse event reporting and creatinine increase (absolute ≥0.3 mg/dL or relative ≥50%), was descriptively reported.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Both dipstick albuminuria and creatinine values were available in 9473 patients (73.2%). More patients with macroalbuminuria, versus no/trace albuminuria, had diabetes (66% vs 27%) or hypertension (86% vs 68%). Rates for CV death and overall mortality per strata were 3.1% and 4.8% (no/trace albuminuria); 5.8% and 9.0% (microalbuminuria); and 7.7% and 12.6% (macroalbuminuria) at 2 years of follow-up. Corresponding rates for CV death or MI were 12.2%, 16.9%, and 23.5%, respectively. Observed acute kidney injury rates were 0.6%, 1.2%, and 2.9% (n = 79), respectively. Adjusted HRs for macroalbuminuria on CV mortality were 1.65 (95% CI 1.15-2.37), and after adjustment with eGFR, 1.37 (95% CI 0.93-2.01). Corresponding HRs for overall mortality were 1.82 (95% CI 1.37-2.42) and 1.47 (95% CI 1.08-1.98).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      High-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes and albuminuria have increased morbidity and increased overall mortality independent of eGFR."
Serum Cytokine Alterations Associated with Age of Patients with Nephropathia Epidemica.,"Venera Shakirova, Ilseyar Khaertynova, Maria Markelova, Rachael Tarlinton, Jerzy Behnke, Ekaterina Martynova, Ekaterina Garanina, Albert Rizvanov, Svetlana Khaiboullina, Venera Shakirovaet al.",2022 Jan 11:2022:4685288.,Biomed Res Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35059462/,No keywords found,"Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a zoonotic disease caused by hantaviruses transmitted from rodents, endemic in the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. The disease presents clinically with mild, moderate, and severe forms, and time-dependent febrile, oliguric, and polyuric stages of the disease are also recognized. The patient's cytokine responses have been suggested to play a central role in disease pathogenesis; however, little is known about the different patterns of cytokine expression in NE in cohorts of different ages and sexes. Serum samples and clinical records were collected from 139 patients and 57 controls (healthy donors) and were used to analyze 48 analytes with the Bio-Plex multiplex magnetic bead-based antibody detection kits. Principal component analysis of 137 patient and 55 controls (for which there was full data) identified two components that individually accounted for >15% of the total variance in results and together for 38% of the total variance. PC1 represented a proinflammatory TH17/TH2 cell antiviral cytokine profile and PC2 a more antiviral cytokine profile with patients tending to display one or the other of these. Severity of disease and stage of illness did not show any correlation with PC1 profiles; however, significant differences were seen in patients with high PC1 profiles vs. lower for a number of individual clinical parameters: High PC1 patients showed a reduced number of febrile days, but higher maximum urine output, higher creatinine levels, and lower platelet levels. Overall, the results of this study point towards a stronger proinflammatory profile occurring in younger NE patients, this being associated with markers of acute kidney injury and low levels of high-density cholesterol. This is consistent with previous work indicating that the pathology of NE is immune driven, with an inflammatory immune response being associated with disease and that this immune response is more extreme in younger patients."

We undertook the present study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 13 weekly doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg of ISIS 388626 in humans. ISIS 388626 increased 24-hour urinary glucose excretion dose dependently with 508.9 ± 781.45 mg/day in the 100-mg and 1299.8 ± 1833.4 mg/day in the 200-mg cohort, versus 88.7 ± 259.29 mg/day in the placebo group. ISIS 388626 induced a reversible increase in serum creatinine, with the largest effect after eight doses of ISIS 388626 (200 mg; 0.38 ± 0.089 mg/dl; 44% increase over baseline). Three subjects were discontinued as a result of creatinine increases. The renal clearance test revealed no indications for impairment of glomerular filtration or renal perfusion. The creatinine increases were accompanied by a rise in the levels of urinary renal damage markers [β-2-microglobulin (B2M), total protein, kidney injury molecule (KIM1), α-glutathione S-transferase (aGST), N-acetyl-β-(d)-glucosaminidase (NAG)]. Other treatment-related adverse events included mild injection site reactions occurring in 8-19% of the subjects. In conclusion, ISIS 388626 treatment induced glucosuria at a dose level of 200 mg/week. This intended pharmacological effect was small, amounting to approximately 1% of the total amount of filtered glucose. Changes in serum and urinary markers were indicative of transient renal dysfunction, most probably of tubular origin. Whether the glucosuria is caused by specific SGLT2 inhibition or general tubular dysfunction or a combination remains uncertain."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiac surgery is a major complication resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. In this study, we assessed the usefulness of estimating serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as a biomarker in predicting AKI in patients with stable chronic kidney disease (CKD) and undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OP-CABG).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      We prospectively studied sixty nondialysis-dependent CKD patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 who required elective OP-CABG. Patients were randomized into two groups, Group D received dopamine infusion at 2 μg/kg/min following anesthesia induction till the end of the surgery and Group P did not receive any intervention. Serum creatinine, NGAL, brain natriuretic peptide, and troponin-I were estimated at specified intervals before, during, and after surgery. The results of the study patients were also compared to a simultaneous matched cohort control of thirty patients (Group A) without renal dysfunction who underwent OP-CABG.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No patient required renal replacement therapy, and no mortality was observed during perioperative and hospitalization period. Six patients from control group (n = 30), ten patients from placebo group (n = 30), and 12 patients from dopamine group (n = 30) developed stage 1 AKI. However, we did not observe any stage 2 and stage 3 AKI among all the groups. There was a significant increase in serum NGAL levels at the end of surgery and 24 h postoperatively in placebo and dopamine groups as compared to the control.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The measurement of NGAL appears to predict the occurrence of AKI after OP-CAB surgery. However, large multicentric studies may be required to confirm the findings of this study."

      Recent evidence suggests an association of plasma Proenkephalin A 119-159 (penKid) with early and successful liberation from continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. However, these exploratory results are derived from a monocentric trial and therefore require external validation in a multicenter cohort.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data and plasma samples from the ""Effect of Regional Citrate Anticoagulation versus Systemic Heparin Anticoagulation During Continuous Kidney Replacement Therapy on Dialysis Filter Life Span and Mortality Among Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury-A Randomized Clinical Trial"" (RICH Trial) were used for this validation study. PenKid was measured in all plasma samples available at CRRT initiation and at day 3 of CRRT. Patients were categorized into low and high penKid groups with a cutoff at 100 pmol/l. Competing-risk time-to-event analyses were performed. Competing risk endpoints were successful and unsuccessful liberation from CRRT, the latter meaning death or initiation of a new RRT within one week of discontinuation of primary CRRT. Then penKid was compared to urinary output.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Low pre-CRRT penKid levels at CRRT initiation were not associated with early and successful liberation from CRRT compared to patients with high pre-CRRT penKid levels [subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.73-1.40, p = 0.945]. However, the landmark analysis on day 3 of ongoing CRRT demonstrated an association between low penKid levels and successful liberation from CRRT (sHR 2.35, 95% CI 1.45-3.81, p < 0.001) and an association between high penKid levels and unsuccessful liberation (sHR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.80, p = 0.007). High daily urinary output (> 436 ml/d) was even stronger associated with successful liberation (sHR 2.91, 95% CI 1.80-4.73, p < 0.001) compared to penKid.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This study suggests that penKid may be a competent biomarker to monitor the recovery of kidney function during CRRT. This is in line with previous findings and investigated this concept in a multicenter cohort. Again, low penKid was associated with early and successful CRRT liberation, but was outperformed by high daily urinary output. The findings of this study now warrant further evaluation in prospective studies or a randomized controlled trial. Trial registration The RICH Trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02669589.

      Randomised trial data assessing the safety and efficacy of the self-expanding intra-annular Portico transcatheter aortic valve system (Abbott Structural Heart, St Paul, MN, USA) compared with any commercially available valves are needed to compare performance among designs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial (the Portico Re-sheathable Transcatheter Aortic Valve System US Investigational Device Exemption trial [PORTICO IDE]), high and extreme risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis were recruited from 52 medical centres experienced in performing transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the USA and Australia. Patients were eligible if they were aged 21 years or older, in New York Heart Association functional class II or higher, and had severe native aortic stenosis. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using permuted block randomisation (block sizes of 2 and 4) and stratified by clinical investigational site, surgical risk cohort, and vascular access method, to transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the first generation Portico valve and delivery system or a commercially available valve (either an intra-annular balloon-expandable Edwards-SAPIEN, SAPIEN XT, or SAPIEN 3 valve [Edwards LifeSciences, Irvine, CA, USA]; or a supra-annular self-expanding CoreValve, Evolut-R, or Evolut-PRO valve [Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA]). Investigational site staff, implanting physician, and study participant were unmasked to treatment assignment. Core laboratories and clinical event assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, life-threatening bleeding requiring transfusion, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, or major vascular complication at 30 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 1 year. Clinical outcomes and valve performance were assessed up to 2 years after the procedure. Primary analyses were by intention to treat and the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate event rates. The non-inferiority margin was 8·5% for primary safety and 8·0% for primary efficacy endpoints. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02000115, and is ongoing.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between May 30 and Sept 12, 2014, and between Aug 21, 2015, and Oct 10, 2017, with recruitment paused for 11 months by the funder, we recruited 1034 patients, of whom 750 were eligible and randomly assigned to the Portico valve group (n=381) or commercially available valve group (n=369). Mean age was 83 years (SD 7) and 395 (52·7%) patients were female. For the primary safety endpoint at 30 days, the event rate was higher in the Portico valve group than in the commercial valve group (52 [13·8%] vs 35 [9·6%]; absolute difference 4·2, 95% CI -0·4 to 8·8 [upper confidence bound {UCB} 8·1%]; pnon-inferiority=0·034, psuperiority=0·071). At 1 year, the rates of the primary efficacy endpoint were similar between the groups (55 [14·8%] in the Portico group vs 48 [13·4%] in the commercial valve group; difference 1·5%, 95% CI -3·6 to 6·5 [UCB 5·7%]; pnon-inferiority=0·0058, psuperiority=0·50). At 2 years, rates of death (80 [22·3%] vs 70 [20·2%]; p=0·40) or disabling stroke (10 [3·1%] vs 16 [5·0%]; p=0·23) were similar between groups.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      The Portico valve was associated with similar rates of death or disabling stroke at 2 years compared with commercial valves, but was associated with higher rates of the primary composite safety endpoint including death at 30 days. The first-generation Portico valve and delivery system did not offer advantages over other commercially available valves.

Safety of metformin continuation in diabetic patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography: the NO-STOP single arm trial.,"Mauro Chiarito#, Jorge Sanz-Sanchez#, Raffaele Piccolo, Francesco Condello, Gaetano Liccardo, Matteo Maurina, Marisa Avvedimento, Damiano Regazzoli, Paolo Pagnotta, Hector M Garcia-Garcia, Roxana Mehran, Massimo Federici, Gianluigi Condorelli, Jose Luis Diez Gil, Bernhard Reimers, Giuseppe Ferrante, Giulio Stefanini, Mauro Chiaritoet al.",2023 Feb 6,Cardiovasc Diabetol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36747244/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Despite paucity of data, it is common practice to discontinue metformin before invasive coronary angiography due to an alleged risk of Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis (M-ALA). We aimed at assessing the safety of metformin continuation in diabetic patients undergoing coronary angiography in terms of significant increase in lactate levels.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this open-label, prospective, multicentre, single-arm trial, all diabetic patients undergoing coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention at 3 European centers were screened for enrolment. The primary endpoint was the increase in lactate levels from preprocedural levels at 72-h after the procedure. Secondary endpoints included contrast associated-acute kidney injury (CA-AKI), M-ALA, and all-cause mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      142 diabetic patients on metformin therapy were included. Median preprocedural lactate level was 1.8 mmol/l [interquartile range (IQR) 1.3-2.3]. Lactate levels at 72 h after coronary angiography were 1.7 mmol/l (IQR 1.3-2.3), with no significant differences as compared to preprocedural levels (p = 0.91; median difference = 0; IQR - 0.5 to 0.4 mmol/l). One patient had 72-h levels ≥ 5 mmol/l (5.3 mmol/l), but no cases of M-ALA were reported. CA-AKI occurred in 9 patients (6.1%) and median serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate remained similar throughout the periprocedural period. At a median follow-up of 90 days (43-150), no patients required hemodialysis and 2 patients died due to non-cardiac causes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In diabetic patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography, metformin continuation throughout the periprocedural period does not increase lactate levels and was not associated with any decline in renal function.

Prosthesis-patient mismatch in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis: A randomized trial of a self-expanding prosthesis.,"George L Zorn rd, Stephen H Little, Peter Tadros, G Michael Deeb, Thomas G Gleason, John Heiser, Neal S Kleiman, Jae K Oh, Jeffrey J Popma, David Adams, Jian Huang, Michael J Reardon, George L Zorn rdet al.",2016 Apr,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26614412/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      We compared the incidence of prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) between transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a self-expanding bioprosthesis and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in the CoreValve US High Risk Pivotal Trial. We sought to determine the influence of PPM on clinical outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with severe aortic stenosis and at increased risk for surgery were randomized 1:1 to TAVR or SAVR. Postoperative PPM was defined by the effective orifice area index (EOAi) as severe PPM (EOAi ≤ 0.65 cm(2)/m(2)) and no severe PPM (EOAi > 0.65 cm(2)/m(2)); clinical outcomes were analyzed in the TAVR arm (n = 389) and SAVR arm (n = 353). Left ventricular mass index and regression were analyzed at baseline and 1 year.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of severe PPM in the SAVR group at 1 year was 25.7% versus 6.2% in the TAVR group (P < .0001). Left ventricular mass index regression at 1 year was 6.8% for TAVR and 15.1% for SAVR in patients with severe PPM. At 1 year the rate of all-cause mortality and acute kidney injury were significantly greater in all patients (TAVR + SAVR) with severe PPM compared with no severe PPM (20.6% vs 12.0% [P = .0145] for death and 19.2% vs 8.5% [P = .0008] for acute kidney injury).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with high surgical risk and severe aortic stenosis, severe PPM is more common in patients treated with SAVR than those treated with TAVR. Patients with severe PPM are a greater risk for death and acute kidney injury than patients without severe PPM."
The EUROpean and Chinese cardiac and renal Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Study (EURO-CRIPS CardioGroup I): A randomized controlled trial.,"Claudio Moretti, Enrico Cerrato, Erika Cavallero, Song Lin, Marco Luciano Rossi, Andrea Picchi, Francesca Sanguineti, Fabrizio Ugo, Alberto Palazzuoli, Maurizio Bertaina, Patrizia Presbitero, Chen Shao-Liang, Roberto Pozzi, Massimo Giammaria, Ugo Limbruno, Thierry Lefèvre, Valeria Gasparetto, Roberto Garbo, Pierluigi Omedè, Imad Sheiban, Javier Escaned, Giuseppe Biondi-Zoccai, Fiorenzo Gaita, Leor Perl, Fabrizio D'Ascenzo, Claudio Morettiet al.",2018 Apr 15:257:1-6.,Int J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29506674/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The potential protective effects of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remain to be defined.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled multicenter study was performed. Patients younger than 85years old, with a renal clearance of 30-60ml/min/1.73m2, who were candidates for PCI for all clinical indications except for primary PCI, were allocated 1:1 to RIPC or to standard therapy. The primary endpoint was incidence of CIN. The secondary endpoint was incidence of peri-procedural myocardial infarction (PMI). From February 2013 to April 2014, 3108 patients who were scheduled for coronary angiography were screened for the study. 442 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 223 received PCI. These patients were randomized to sham RIPC (n=107) or treatment group (n=116). The only pre-specified subgroup of diabetic patients included 85 (38%) cases. RIPC significantly reduced CIN incidence in the overall population (12.1% vs. 26.1%, p=0.01, with a NNT=9) and in non-diabetic patients (9.2% vs. 25.0%, p=0.02), but showed no benefit in diabetics (16.7% vs. 28.2%, p=0.21). A trend for lower PMI was seen in the intervention arm (creatine kinase - muscle brain >5 URL; 8.4% vs. 16.4%, p=0.07; troponin T >5 URL; 27% vs. 38%, p=0.21).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Remote ischemic preconditioning significantly reduces the incidence of acute kidney injury in non-diabetic patients undergoing PCI. Larger sample size is presumably needed to assess the effect of RIPC for patients with diabetes mellitus. Clinical Trial number:NCT02195726https://www.clinicaltrial.gov/."
"A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Phase IIb Trial of Avoidance of Hyperoxemia during Cardiopulmonary Bypass.","Shay P McGuinness, Rachael L Parke, Kate Drummond, Tim Willcox, Michael Bailey, Cornelius Kruger, Megan Baker, Keri-Anne Cowdrey, Eileen Gilder, Lianne McCarthy, Thomas Painter;, SO-COOL investigators, ShayP McGuinness, RachaelL Parke, Thomas Painter, Shay P McGuinnesset al.",2016 Sep,Anesthesiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27404222/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Cardiac surgery utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is one of the most common forms of major surgery. Cardiac surgery-associated multiorgan dysfunction (CSA-MOD) is well recognized and includes acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic impairment, myocardial damage, and postoperative neurologic deficit. Pathophysiology of CSA-MOD involves numerous injurious pathways linked to the use of CPB including oxidative stress and formation of reactive iron species. During cardiac surgery with CPB, arterial return blood is oxygenated to supranormal levels. This study aimed to determine whether the avoidance of arterial hyperoxemia decreased oxidative stress and reduced the severity of the multiorgan dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery utilizing CPB.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled study of the avoidance of arterial hyperoxemia versus usual care in patients undergoing cardiac surgery involving CPB. Primary outcome was the incidence and severity of AKI. Secondary outcomes included serum biomarkers for CSA-MOD, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of intensive care and hospital stay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 298 patients were randomized and analyzed at two hospitals in New Zealand and Australia. Mean PaO2 was significantly different between groups during CPB. There was no difference in the development of AKI (intervention arm 72.0% vs. usual care 66.2%; difference, -5.8% [95% CI, -16.1 to 4.7%]; P = 0.28), other markers of organ damage, or intensive care unit and hospital length of stay.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Avoiding modest hyperoxemia during CPB failed to demonstrate any difference in AKI, markers of organ damage, or length of stay."
Pharmacological effects of ex vivo mesenchymal stem cell immunotherapy in patients with acute kidney injury and underlying systemic inflammation.,"Madhav Swaminathan, Nelson Kopyt, Mohamed G Atta, Jai Radhakrishnan, Kausik Umanath, Sunny Nguyen, Brian O'Rourke, Ashley Allen, Natalie Vaninov, Arno Tilles, Elizabeth LaPointe, Andrew Blair, Chris Gemmiti, Brian Miller, Biju Parekkadan, Rita N Barcia, Madhav Swaminathanet al.",2021 Dec,Stem Cells Transl Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34581517/,No keywords found,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have natural immunoregulatory functions that have been explored for medicinal use as a cell therapy with limited success. A phase Ib study was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunoregulatory mechanism of action of MSCs using a novel ex vivo product (SBI-101) to preserve cell activity in patients with severe acute kidney injury. Pharmacological data demonstrated MSC-secreted factor activity that was associated with anti-inflammatory signatures in the molecular and cellular profiling of patient blood. Systems biology analysis captured multicompartment effects consistent with immune reprogramming and kidney tissue repair. Although the study was not powered for clinical efficacy, these results are supportive of the therapeutic hypothesis, namely, that treatment with SBI-101 elicits an immunotherapeutic response that triggers an accelerated phenotypic switch from tissue injury to tissue repair. Ex vivo administration of MSCs, with increased power of testing, is a potential new biological delivery paradigm that assures sustained MSC activity and immunomodulation."
Effect of Exogenous Albumin on the Incidence of Postoperative Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery with a Preoperative Albumin Level of Less Than 4.0 g/dl.,"Eun-Ho Lee, Wook-Jong Kim, Ji-Yeon Kim, Ji-Hyun Chin, Dae-Kee Choi, Ji-Yeon Sim, Suk-Jung Choo, Cheol-Hyun Chung, Jae-Won Lee, In-Cheol Choi, Eun-Ho Leeet al.",2016 May,Anesthesiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26891150/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Hypoalbuminemia may increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). The authors investigated whether the immediate preoperative administration of 20% albumin solution affects the incidence of AKI after off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective, single-center, randomized, parallel-arm double-blind trial, 220 patients with preoperative serum albumin levels less than 4.0 g/dl were administered 100, 200, or 300 ml of 20% human albumin according to the preoperative serum albumin level (3.5 to 3.9, 3.0 to 3.4, or less than 3.0 g/dl, respectively) or with an equal volume of saline before surgery. The primary outcome measure was AKI incidence after surgery. Postoperative AKI was defined by maximal AKI Network criteria based on creatinine changes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patient characteristics and perioperative data except urine output during surgery were similar between the two groups studied, the albumin group and the control group. Urine output (median [interquartile range]) during surgery was higher in the albumin group (550 ml [315 to 980]) than in the control group (370 ml [230 to 670]; P = 0.006). The incidence of postoperative AKI in the albumin group was lower than that in the control group (14 [13.7%] vs. 26 [25.7%]; P = 0.048). There were no significant between-group differences in severe AKI, including renal replacement therapy, 30-day mortality, and other clinical outcomes. There were no significant adverse events.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Administration of 20% exogenous albumin immediately before surgery increases urine output during surgery and reduces the risk of AKI after off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with a preoperative serum albumin level of less than 4.0 g/dl."

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not uncommon in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We examined the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of AKI from the BRAVO 3 randomized trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The BRAVO-3 trial included 802 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR randomized to bivalirudin vs. unfractionated heparin (UFH). The primary endpoint of the trial was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type ≥ 3b bleeding at 48 h. Total follow-up was to 30 days. AKI was adjudicated using the modified RIFLE (Valve Academic Research Consortium, VARC 1) criteria through 30-day follow-up, and in a sensitivity analysis AKI was assessed at 7 days (modified VARC-2 criteria). We examined the incidence, predictors, and 30-day outcomes associated with diagnosis of AKI. We also examined the effect of procedural anticoagulant (bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin, UFH) on AKI within 48 h after TAVR.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial population had a mean age of 82.3 ± 6.5 years including 48.8% women with mean EuroScore I 17.05 ± 10.3%. AKI occurred in 17.0% during 30-day follow-up and was associated with greater adjusted risk of 30-day death (13.0% vs. 3.5%, OR 5.84, 95% CI 2.62-12.99) and a trend for more BARC ≥ 3b bleeding (15.1% vs. 8.6%, OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.99-3.25). Predictors of 30-day AKI were baseline hemoglobin, body weight, and pre-existing coronary disease. AKI occurred in 10.7% at 7 days and was associated with significantly greater risk of 30-day death (OR 6.99, 95% CI 2.85-17.15). Independent predictors of AKI within 7 days included pre-existing coronary or cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and transfusion which increased risk, whereas post-dilation was protective. The incidence of 48-h AKI was higher with bivalirudin compared to UFH in the intention to treat cohort (10.9% vs. 6.5%, p = 0.03), but not in the per-protocol assessment (10.7% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.08).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In the BRAVO 3 trial, AKI occurred in 17% at 30 days and in 10.7% at 7 days. AKI was associated with a significantly greater adjusted risk for 30-day death. Multivariate predictors of AKI at 30 days included baseline hemoglobin, body weight, and prior coronary artery disease, and predictors at 7 days included pre-existing vascular disease, CKD, transfusion, and valve post-dilation. Bivalirudin was associated with greater AKI within 48 h in the intention to treat but not in the per-protocol analysis."
A comparison of sevoflurane versus sevoflurane-propofol combination on renal function in patients undergoing valvular heart surgery-A prospective randomized controlled pilot study.,"Reshmi L Jose, Deepa Damayanathi, Koniaparambil P Unnikrishnan, Puthuvassery R Suneel, Reshmi L Joseet al.",2021 Apr-Jun,Ann Card Anaesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33884972/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      The objective of the present study was to compare the effect of sevoflurane with the sevoflurane-propofol combination on renal function in patients undergoing valvular heart surgery. The renal protective effect was assessed using a novel marker called neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This was a prospective randomized controlled pilot study conducted at a tertiary care center in India. The study enrolled 36 patients undergoing elective valvular heart surgery, but only 31 were included. All the patients were randomized into two groups, that is, 15 in the sevoflurane group (S-group) and 16 in the sevoflurane-propofol group (SP-group). The baseline NGAL level and test NGAL level at 4 h after cardiopulmonary bypass were measured.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was a significant rise in the test NGAL levels compared to baseline in both the groups. The test NGAL level in the S-group was significantly high compared to that of the SP-group (P = 0.034). The number of patients with acute kidney injury was less in the SP-group without reaching statistical significance (P = 0.210).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Renal function was better preserved in patients anesthetized with a combination of sevoflurane and propofol. This could be due to the enhanced protective effect on renal function by both sevoflurane and propofol."

      The occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing invasive management is associated with worse outcomes. However, the prognostic implications of transient or in-hospital persistent AKI may differ.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic implications of transient or in-hospital persistent AKI in patients with ACS.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In the MATRIX (Minimizing Adverse Haemorrhagic Events by Transradial Access Site and Systemic Implementation of Angiox) trial, 203 subjects were excluded because of incomplete information or end-stage renal disease, with a study population of 8,201 patients. Transient and persistent AKI were defined as renal dysfunction no longer or still fulfilling the AKI criteria (>0.5 mg/dL or a relative >25% increase in creatinine) at discharge, respectively. Thirty-day coprimary outcomes were the out-of-hospital composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]) and net adverse cardiovascular events (NACE), defined as the composite of MACE or Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 3 or 5 bleeding.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Persistent and transient AKI occurred in 750 (9.1%) and 587 (7.2%) subjects, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, compared with patients without AKI, the risk for 30-day coprimary outcomes was higher in patients with persistent AKI (MACE: adjusted HR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.48-3.64; P < 0.001; NACE: adjusted HR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.48-3.52; P < 0.001), driven mainly by all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 3.43; 95% CI: 2.03-5.82; P < 0.001), whereas transient AKI was not associated with higher rates of MACE or NACE. Results remained consistent when implementing the KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) criteria.
    


          Conclusions:

Deterioration of renal function at stent implantation can predict long-term outcome after stent thrombosis.,"Vojko Kanic, Meta Penko, Franjo Husam Naji, Robert Ekart, Zlatka Kanic, Dejan Dinevski, Radovan Hojs, Vojko Kanicet al.",2015 Dec:127 Suppl 5:S181-6.,Wien Klin Wochenschr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26377173/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to examine the possible influence of minor deterioration of the renal function after stent implantation not fulfilling the criteria for acute kidney injury on long-term outcomes after stent thrombosis (ST).
    


          Background:
        
      
      Decreased renal function (DRF) is associated with an increased risk for worse outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention. There is no data if the deterioration of renal function after stent implantation influences the prognosis after ST. If so patients with a higher risk for worse outcome after ST could be identified already at the time of stent implantation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from 4824 consecutive patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention in our center was recorded from March 2004 to April 2010. We excluded patients with acute kidney injury at stent implantation and 86 of them with ST without acute kidney injury at stent implantation were involved in the study. They were prospectively followed until December 2012 for 50.2 ± 28.1 months. Only patients with definite ST were included in the study. The Academic Research Consortium definition of ST was used. Data on death, myocardial infarction, and repeated percutaneous or operative revascularization after ST were ascertained from the hospital database, by phone or with clinical examinations. The outcomes after definite ST were compared in patients with and without deterioration of renal function after stent implantation (DRFafterSI).
    


          Results:
        
      
      During the observational period patients with DRFafterSI had a higher mortality rate after ST than patients without DRFafterSI (35.1 vs. 10.3 %; p <0.019). The incidence of major adverse cardiac events (major adverse coronary event (MACE)-death, myocardial infarction, repeated revascularization) rate after ST was similar in both groups (66.1 % with DRFafterSI vs. 55.2 % without DRFafterSI). The prevalence of myocardial infarction was also similar in both groups (31.6 vs. 34.5 %) as was the revascularizations rate (43.9 vs. 48.3 %). Death was predicted by DRFafterSI (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 3.96; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 14.10; p <0.034) and age > 75 years (adjusted HR 2.85: 95 % CI 1.12-7.30; p = 0.029). We could not find any predictor for MACE.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Even more subtle DRFafterSI (not fulfilling the criteria for acute kidney injury) at stent implantation were associated with higher long-term mortality after ST. Especially at risk were patients older than 75 years at stent implantation. DRFafterSI and age more than 75 years pointed out the group of patients with a high risk for death after ST already at the time of stent implantation. The best treatment option for preventing ST in these patients is still to be determined. Until then, we must pay a special attention to proper patients' preparation and hydration to avoid DRFafterSI."

      Acute kidney injury often goes unrecognised in its early stages when effective treatment options might be available. We aimed to determine whether an automated electronic alert for acute kidney injury would reduce the severity of such injury and improve clinical outcomes in patients in hospital.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this investigator-masked, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, patients were recruited from the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA, USA. Eligible participants were adults aged 18 years or older who were in hospital with stage 1 or greater acute kidney injury as defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes creatinine-based criteria. Exclusion criteria were initial hospital creatinine 4·0 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88·4) or greater, fewer than two creatinine values measured, inability to determine the covering provider, admission to hospice or the observation unit, previous randomisation, or end-stage renal disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated sequence to receive an acute kidney injury alert (a text-based alert sent to the covering provider and unit pharmacist indicating new acute kidney injury) or usual care, stratified by medical versus surgical admission and intensive care unit versus non-intensive care unit location in blocks of 4-8 participants. The primary outcome was a composite of relative maximum change in creatinine, dialysis, and death at 7 days after randomisation. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01862419.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Sept 17, 2013, and April 14, 2014, 23,664 patients were screened. 1201 eligible participants were assigned to the acute kidney injury alert group and 1192 were assigned to the usual care group. Composite relative maximum change in creatinine, dialysis, and death at 7 days did not differ between the alert group and the usual care group (p=0·88), or within any of the four randomisation strata (all p>0·05). At 7 days after randomisation, median maximum relative change in creatinine concentrations was 0·0% (IQR 0·0-18·4) in the alert group and 0·6% (0·0-17·5) in the usual care group (p=0·81); 87 (7·2%) patients in the alert group and 70 (5·9%) patients in usual care group had received dialysis (odds ratio 1·25 [95% CI 0·90-1·74]; p=0·18); and 71 (5·9%) patients in the alert group and 61 (5·1%) patients in the usual care group had died (1·16 [0·81-1·68]; p=0·40).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      An electronic alert system for acute kidney injury did not improve clinical outcomes among patients in hospital.

Differential effect on mortality of the timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy according to the criteria used to diagnose acute kidney injury: an IDEAL-ICU substudy.,"Saber Davide Barbar, Abderrahmane Bourredjem, Rémi Trusson, Auguste Dargent, Christine Binquet, Jean-Pierre Quenot                                                                                          ;, IDEAL-ICU Study, Raphaël Clere-Jehl, Romain Hernu, Florent Montini, Rémi Bruyère, Christine Lebert, Julien Bohé, Julio Badie, Jean-Pierre Eraldi, Jean-Philippe Rigaud, Bruno Levy, Shidasp Siami, Guillaume Louis, Lila Bouadma, Jean-Michel Constantin, Emmanuelle Mercier, Kada Klouche, Damien Du Cheyron, Gaël Piton, Djillali Annane, Samir Jaber, Therry van der Linden, Gilles Blasco, Jean-Paul Mira, Carole Schwebel, Loïc Chimot, Philippe Guiot, Mai-Anh Nay, Ferhat Meziani, Julie Helms, Claire Roger, Benjamin Louart, Saber Davide Barbaret al.",2023 Aug 17,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37592355/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      This substudy of the randomized IDEAL-ICU trial assessed whether the timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation has a differential effect on 90-day mortality, according to the criteria used to diagnose acute kidney injury (AKI), in patients with early-stage septic shock.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Three groups were considered according to the criterion defining AKI: creatinine elevation only (group 1), reduced urinary output only (group 2), creatinine elevation plus reduced urinary output (group 3). Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause death. Secondary endpoints were RRT-free days, RRT dependence and renal function at discharge. We assessed the interaction between RRT strategy (early vs. delayed) and group, and the association between RRT strategy and mortality in each group by logistic regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 488 patients enrolled, 205 (42%) patients were in group 1, 174 (35%) in group 2, and 100 (20%) in group 3. The effect of RRT initiation strategy on 90-day mortality across groups showed significant heterogeneity (adjusted interaction p = 0.021). Mortality was 58% vs. 42% for early vs. late RRT initiation, respectively, in group 1 (p = 0.028); 57% vs. 67%, respectively, in group 2 (p = 0.18); and 58% vs. 55%, respectively, in group 3 (p = 0.79). There was no significant difference in secondary outcomes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The timing of RRT initiation has a differential impact on outcome according to AKI diagnostic criteria. In patients with elevated creatinine only, early RRT initiation was associated with significantly increased mortality. In patients with reduced urine output only, late RRT initiation was associated with a nonsignificant, 10% absolute increase in mortality."

      Intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) are considered at high risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is often prescribed. We aimed to assess the incidence of GI bleeding and effects of SUP in these patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We assessed GI bleeding in ICU patients receiving RRT at baseline (and at any time in the ICU) and effects of prophylactic pantoprazole versus placebo in the international SUP in the ICU (SUP-ICU) trial. All analyses were conducted according to a published protocol and statistical analysis plan.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data of 3,291 acutely admitted adult ICU patients with one or more risk factors for GI bleeding randomized to pantoprazole or placebo intravenously once daily during ICU stay (until ICU discharge, death, or a maximum of 90 days) were analyzed. Some 20 out of 258 (7.8%, 95% CI 4.5-11.1%) and 52 out of 568 (9.2%, 95% CI 6.8-11.6%) of the patients receiving RRT at baseline and at any time in ICU, respectively, developed clinically important GI bleeding in the ICU. We did not observe statistically significant differences in the intervention effect (pantoprazole vs. placebo) in the proportion of patients with clinically important GI bleeding, clinically important events, infectious adverse events, use of interventions to stop GI bleeding, or 90-day mortality in patients with versus without RRT at baseline.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In adult ICU patients receiving RRT at baseline, we observed high incidences of clinically important GI bleeding, but did not observe effects of pantoprazole versus placebo in this subgroup."

      This study was designed to assess the association of age and frailty with clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI), according to accelerated and standard renal-replacement therapy (RRT) initiation strategies in the STARRT-AKI trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a secondary analysis of an international randomized trial. Older age was defined as ≥65 years. Frailty was assessed using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) score and defined as a score ≥5. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included RRT dependence and RRT-free days at 90 days. We used logistic and linear regression and interaction testing to explore the impact of age and frailty on clinical outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 2,927 patients randomized in the STARRT-AKI trial, 1,616 (55.2%) were aged ≥65 years (median [interquartile range] 73.9 [69.4-78.9]). Older patients had greater comorbid cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease, were more likely to be surgical admissions and to receive vasopressors at baseline. Older patients had higher 90-day mortality (50.4% vs. 35.6%, adjusted-odds ratio (OR), 1.81 [1.53-2.13], p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in RRT dependence at 90 days between older and younger patients (8.7% vs. 7.8%, adjusted-OR, 1.21 [0.82-1.79], p = 0.325). Patients with frailty had higher mortality; but no difference in RRT dependence at 90 days. There was no significant interaction between age and CFS score in relation to mortality, RRT dependence at 90 days, and other secondary outcomes. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who received RRT in the standard-strategy stratified by age groups (adjusted-OR, 0.85 [0.67-1.08], p = 0.180).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this secondary analysis of the STARRT-AKI trial, older and frail patients had higher mortality at 90 days; however, there was no difference in RRT dependence. Mortality and RRT dependence were not modified by RRT initiation strategy in older or frail patients."
The influence of prolonged temperature management on acute kidney injury after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A post hoc analysis of the TTH48 trial.,"Kristian Strand, Eldar Søreide, Hans Kirkegaard, Fabio Silvio Taccone, Anders Morten Grejs, Christophe Henri Valdemar Duez, Anni Nørgaard Jeppesen, Christian Storm, Bodil Steen Rasmussen, Timo Laitio, Christian Hassager, Valdo Toome, Johanna Hästbacka, Markus B Skrifvars, Kristian Strandet al.",2020 Jun:151:10-17.,Resuscitation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32087257/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common after cardiac arrest and targeted temperature management (TTM). The impact of different lengths of cooling on the development of AKI has not been well studied. In this study of patients included in a randomised controlled trial of TTM at 33 °C for 24 versus 48 h after cardiac arrest (TTH48 trial), we examined the influence of prolonged TTM on AKI and the incidence and factors associated with the development of AKI. We also examined the impact of AKI on survival.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study was a sub-study of the TTH48 trial, which included patients cooled to 33 ± 1 °C after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for 24 versus 48 h. AKI was classified according to the KDIGO AKI criteria based on serum creatinine and urine output collected until ICU discharge for a maximum of seven days. Survival was followed for up to six months. The association of admission factors on AKI was analysed with multivariate analysis and the association of AKI on mortality was analysed with Cox regression using the time to AKI as a time-dependent covariate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 349 patients included in the study, 159 (45.5%) developed AKI. There was no significant difference in the incidence, severity or time to AKI between the 24- and 48-h groups. Serum creatinine values had significantly different trajectories for the two groups with a sharp rise occurring during rewarming. Age, time to return of spontaneous circulation, serum creatinine at admission and body mass index were independent predictors of AKI. Patients with AKI had a higher mortality than patients without AKI (hospital mortality 36.5% vs 12.5%, p < 0.001), but only AKI stages 2 and 3 were independently associated with mortality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We did not find any association between prolonged TTM at 33 °C and the risk of AKI during the first seven days in the ICU. AKI is prevalent after cardiac arrest and TTM and occurs in almost half of all ICU admitted patients and more commonly in the elderly, with an increasing BMI and longer arrest duration. AKI after cardiac arrest is an independent predictor of time to death."
Perioperative Metabolites Are Associated With Adverse Neonatal Congenital Heart Disease Surgical Outcomes.,"Jessica Heibel, Eric M Graham, William T Mahle, Aurelie Roux, David Graham, Cedric Manlhiot, Allen D Everett, Jessica Heibelet al.",2022 Aug 16,J Am Heart Assoc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35946448/,"acute kidney injury, cardiac surgical procedures, cardiopulmonary bypass, congenital, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, heart defects, infant, newborn, risk factors.","Background Clinical risk factors in neonatal cardiac surgery do not fully capture discrepancies in outcomes. Targeted metabolomic analysis of plasma from neonates undergoing heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass was performed to determine associations with clinical outcomes. Methods and Result Samples and clinical variables from 149 neonates enrolled in the Corticosteroid Therapy in Neonates Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass trial with surgical treatment for congenital heart disease between 2012 and 2016 were included. Blood samples were collected before skin incision, immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass, and 12 hours after surgery. Outcomes include composite morbidity/mortality (death, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiac arrest, acute kidney injury, and/or hepatic injury) and a cardiac composite (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiac arrest, or increase in lactate level), hepatic injury, and acute kidney injury. Targeted metabolite levels were determined by high-resolution tandem liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Principal component and regression analyses were used to assess associations between metabolic profiles and outcomes, with 2 models created: a base clinical model and a base model+metabolites. Of the 193 metabolites examined, 40 were detected and quantified. The first principal component, principal component 1, was composed mostly of preoperative metabolites and was significantly associated with the composite morbidity/mortality, cardiac composite, and hepatic injury outcomes. In regression models, individual metabolites also improved model performance for the composite morbidity/mortality, cardiac composite, and hepatic injury outcomes. Significant disease pathways included myocardial injury (false discovery rate, 0.00091) and heart failure (false discovery rate, 0.041). Conclusions In neonatal cardiac surgery, perioperative metabolites were associated with postoperative outcomes and improved clinical model outcome associations. Preoperative metabolite levels alone may improve risk models and provide a basis for optimizing perioperative care."
Comparison of double-dose vs. usual dose of nicorandil for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy after cardiac catheterization.,"Zhican Zeng, XiaoFeng Fu, Xue Zhang, Naikuan Fu, Zhican Zenget al.",2019 Nov,Int Urol Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31385178/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Contrast-associated nephropathy (CIN), the third main reason of the acute kidney injury (AKI) in inpatients, is a potentially severe side effect of angiography and the preventive role of nicorandil on CIN is still controversal. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the preventive role of different doses of nicorandil on CIN in patients experiencing cardiac catheterization compared with hydration.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We recorded outcomes from 330 patients who were randomly divided to either a double-dose (30 mg/day) nicorandil group or to a usual-dose (15 mg/day) nicorandil group or a control group (hydration only). The primary endpoint of the current research was the occurrence of CIN, which is defined as a relative elevation of SCr level of 25% above the baseline or an absolute increment of SCr of more than 44.2 µmol/L (0.5 mg/dL) within 48 or 72 h after contrast medium exposure. Additional endpoints were the changes in BUN, SCr, Cys-C, eGFR, and CRP level within 48 h after contrast agent exposure and major adverse events occurring during hospitalization and 14 days of follow-up.
    


          Results:
        
      
      6 out of 111 patients (5.4%) had contrast-induced nephropathy in the double-dose group and it occured 11 out of 107 patients (10.3%) in the usual-dose group, 16 out of 112 patients (14.3%) in the control group. There was a significant difference in the occurrence of CIN between the double-dose group and the control group at 48 h after taking the radiocontrast medium (p = 0.026) while no such significant difference observed in the usual-dose group and the control group (p = 0.367), the double-dose group and usual-dose group (p = 0.180) as well.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Daily peri-procedural usual-dose nicorandil could just relieve contrast-induced renal injury, only double-dose nicorandil was associated with a reduced incidence of CI-AKI compared with hydration."

      Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is a promising method for noninvasive evaluation of the renal parenchyma.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To investigate the contribution of ARFI quantitative US elastography for the detection of renal damage in kidneys with and without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      One hundred seventy-six kidneys of 88 children (46 male, 42 female) who had been referred for voiding cystourethrography and 20 healthy controls were prospectively investigated. Patients were assessed according to severity of renal damage on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Ninety-eight age- and gender-matched healthy children constituted the control group. Quantitative shear wave velocity (SWV) measurements were performed in the upper and lower poles and in the interpolar region of each kidney. DMSA scintigraphy was performed in 62 children (124 kidneys). Comparisons of SWV values of kidneys with and without renal damage and/or VUR were done.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Significantly higher SWV values were found in non-damaged kidneys. Severely damaged kidneys had the lowest SWV values (P < 0.001). High-grade (grade V-IV) refluxing kidneys had the lowest SWV values, while non-refluxing kidneys had the highest values (P < 0.05). Significant negative correlations were found between the mean quantitative US elastography values and DMSA scarring score (r = -0.788, P < 0.001) and VUR grade (r = -0.634, P < 0.001). SWV values of the control kidneys were significantly higher than those of damaged kidneys (P < 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our findings suggest decreasing SWV of renal units with increasing grades of vesicoureteric reflux, increasing DMSA-assessed renal damage and decreasing DMSA-assessed differential function."

      In a previously reported randomized trial of standard and intensive systolic blood-pressure control, data on some outcome events had yet to be adjudicated and post-trial follow-up data had not yet been collected.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We randomly assigned 9361 participants who were at increased risk for cardiovascular disease but did not have diabetes or previous stroke to adhere to an intensive treatment target (systolic blood pressure, <120 mm Hg) or a standard treatment target (systolic blood pressure, <140 mm Hg). The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, acute decompensated heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. Additional primary outcome events occurring through the end of the intervention period (August 20, 2015) were adjudicated after data lock for the primary analysis. We also analyzed post-trial observational follow-up data through July 29, 2016.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At a median of 3.33 years of follow-up, the rate of the primary outcome and all-cause mortality during the trial were significantly lower in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (rate of the primary outcome, 1.77% per year vs. 2.40% per year; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.86; all-cause mortality, 1.06% per year vs. 1.41% per year; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.92). Serious adverse events of hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, acute kidney injury or failure, and syncope were significantly more frequent in the intensive-treatment group. When trial and post-trial follow-up data were combined (3.88 years in total), similar patterns were found for treatment benefit and adverse events; however, rates of heart failure no longer differed between the groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients who were at increased cardiovascular risk, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg resulted in lower rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and lower all-cause mortality than targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg, both during receipt of the randomly assigned therapy and after the trial. Rates of some adverse events were higher in the intensive-treatment group. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; SPRINT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01206062.)."
Possibilities of Azilsartan Medoxomil for Preparation for Planned Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"A M Kochergina, O L Barbarash, A M Kocherginaet al.",2024 Jul 31,Kardiologiia,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39102573/,No keywords found,"Aim:
        
      
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of azilsartan medoxomil for preoperative preparation and improving the long-term prognosis of elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), arterial hypertension (AH), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      The study sample included patients with type 2 DM referred for elective PCI who had poor blood pressure (BP) control according to 24-hour BP monitoring (24-BPM) (mean daily systolic BP ≥130 mmHg, mean daily diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg). The data were collected from 2018 through 2020. A total of 75 patients was included and distributed by simple randomization into two groups: group 1 (main, n=37) received azilsartan medoxomil as an antihypertensive drug at a dose of 40 mg/day (previously prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) were discontinued); group 2 (control, n=38) continued on their previous antihypertensive therapy. The follow-up period was 6 months. During each of 5 consecutive follow-up visits, the patient was examined, 24-BPM was recorded, and urinary markers of renal dysfunction (glomerular filtration rate, GFR; neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, NGAL; urine albumin-creatinine ratio, UACR; kidney injury molecule, KIM-1; and interleukin-18, IL-18) were measured.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During the azilsartan treatment, GFR decreased by 7.4%, while in the control group, it decreased by 18.9% (p&lt;0.001). For 6 months of follow-up, no changes in the NGAL concentration were found in the main group, while the NGAL concentration in the control group increased by 12.9%. With azilsartan, there was a decrease in the urinary concentration of IL-18 (16.9%), while in patients of the control group, IL-18 increased (7.14%). Proteinuria progressed in both groups, which was expectable given the presence of DM; however, in patients receiving azilsartan, the UACR value increased by 37.5%, while in patients of the control group, it increased by 96.15%. These differences were statistically significant. No statistically significant differences were found in the concentrations of cystatin C and KIM-1.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study demonstrated two important facts: the possibility for diagnosing contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) using new, more sensitive markers of kidney damage, which is important for assessing the effectiveness of prevention, and the possibility of using ARBs, in particular azilsartan, for the prevention of CI-AKI in patients with IHD in combination with AH and DM."

      We randomly assigned 1922 patients in sinus rhythm who were scheduled for elective cardiac surgery to receive perioperative rosuvastatin (at a dose of 20 mg daily) or placebo. The primary outcomes were postoperative atrial fibrillation within 5 days after surgery, as assessed by Holter electrocardiographic monitoring, and myocardial injury within 120 hours after surgery, as assessed by serial measurements of the cardiac troponin I concentration. Secondary outcomes included major in-hospital adverse events, duration of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit, left ventricular and renal function, and blood biomarkers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein after surgery were lower in patients assigned to rosuvastatin than in those assigned to placebo (P<0.001). However, the rate of postoperative atrial fibrillation did not differ significantly between the rosuvastatin group and the placebo group (21.1% and 20.5%, respectively; odds ratio 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.30; P=0.72), nor did the area under the troponin I-release curve (102 ng×hour per milliliter and 100 ng×hour per milliliter, respectively; between-group difference, 1%; 95% CI, -9 to 13; P=0.80). Subgroup analyses did not indicate benefit in any category of patient. Rosuvastatin therapy did not result in beneficial effects on any of the secondary outcomes but was associated with a significant absolute (±SE) excess of 5.4±1.9 percentage points in the rate of postoperative acute kidney injury (P=0.005).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this trial, perioperative statin therapy did not prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation or perioperative myocardial damage in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Acute kidney injury was more common with rosuvastatin. (Funded by the British Heart Foundation and others; STICS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01573143.)."
Trimetazidine can prevent the occurrence of contrast-induced nephropathy after percutaneous coronary intervention in elderly patients with renal insufficiency.,"Han Fu, Jing Zhang, Hong Zhang, Peng Zhang, Xiaofeng Fu, Zhican Zeng, Xue Zhang, Wenyuan Li, Shicheng Yang, Xiaogang Liu, Naikuan Fu, Han Fuet al.",2021 Sep,Perfusion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32909511/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has become a common cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury in elderly patients. Trimetazidine (TMZ) is a type of anti-ischemic drug developed in recent years, which can reduce the incidence of CIN. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of TMZ in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in elderly patients with renal insufficiency undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and to explore the mechanism of action.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 310 elderly patients with renal insufficiency undergoing elective PCI were enrolled and randomly assigned to a control group (n = 155, hydration only) and a TMZ group (n = 155, 20 mg thrice daily orally 24 hours before and 72 hours after PCI). The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of CIN, which was defined as an increase of 25% or more, or an absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dL or more in serum creatinine from baseline value, at 48 to 72 hours following the exposure to contrast media (CM).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of CIN was significantly lower in the TMZ group than that in the control group (3.2% vs. 9.7%, p = 0.021). There was no difference regarding the incidence of major adverse events during hospitalization between the TMZ group and control group (1.9% vs. 2.6%, p = 1.000). Binary logistic regression results showed that TMZ was protective factors of CIN (OR = 0.274; 95% CI: 0.089-0.847; p = 0.025).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Therefore, we came to the conclusion that prophylactic administration of TMZ can prevent the occurrence of CIN in elderly patients with renal insufficiency undergoing PCI and has a certain protective effect on the renal function of patients. According to the experimental results and the mechanism of TMZ on cardiomyocytes, we speculate that TMZ increases kidney glucose metabolism, reduces fatty acid oxidation, and also has a protective effect on kidney free radical damage and ischemia-reperfusion injury."

      To evaluate whether extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs) randomized to erythropoietin have better or worse kidney-related outcomes during hospitalization and at 22-26 months of corrected gestational age (cGA) compared with those randomized to placebo.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      We performed an ancillary study to a multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of erythropoietin in ELGANs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The prevalence of severe (stage 2 or 3) acute kidney injury (AKI) was 18.2%. We did not find a statistically significant difference between those randomized to erythropoietin vs placebo for in-hospital primary (severe AKI) or secondary outcomes (any AKI and serum creatinine/cystatin C values at days 0, 7, 9, and 14). At 22-26 months of cGA, 16% of the cohort had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 35.8% had urine albumin/creatinine ratio >30 mg/g, 23% had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) >95th percentile for age, and 40% had a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >95th percentile for age. SBP >90th percentile occurred less often among recipients of erythropoietin (P < .04). This association remained even after controlling for gestational age, site, and sibship (aOR 0.6; 95% CI 0.39-0.92). We did not find statistically significant differences between treatment groups in eGFR, albumin/creatinine ratio, rates of SBP >95th percentile, or DBP >90th or >95th percentiles at the 2 year follow-up visit.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      ELGANs have high rates of in-hospital AKI and kidney-related problems at 22-26 months of cGA. Recombinant erythropoietin may protect ELGANs against long-term elevated SBP but does not appear to protect from AKI, low eGFR, albuminuria, or elevated DBP at 22-26 months of cGA."
Effect of a Single Bolus of Erythropoietin on Renoprotection in Patients Undergoing Thoracic Aortic Surgery With Moderate Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest.,"Ji Eun Kim, Suk Won Song, Jong Yeop Kim, Hyun Joo Lee, Kum-Hee Chung, Yon Hee Shim, Ji Eun Kimet al.",2016 Feb,Ann Thorac Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26576750/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been shown to exert cytoprotection against ischemia. This study examined the effect of erythropoietin in preventing AKI during thoracic aortic surgery with moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this double-blind, randomized study, 66 patients undergoing thoracic aortic surgery with moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (target temperature, 28°C) randomly received either erythropoietin 500 IU·kg(-1) or the same amount of normal saline intravenously after anesthesia induction. The primary endpoint was incidence of AKI defined according to the RIFLE criteria during the first 7 postoperative days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      AKI occurred in 60% of all patients. The two groups did not show any differences in the incidence and severity of AKI. Also, there was no difference in the level of serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin between the groups. The cardiac index was higher in the erythropoietin group, however, immediately after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (p = 0.02). Furthermore, postoperative cardiac complications and prolonged vasopressor dependence were reduced in the erythropoietin group (p = 0.04 and p = 0.049, respectively).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A single bolus administration of erythropoietin 500 IU·kg(-1) at anesthesia induction failed to provide renoprotection in patients who underwent thoracic aortic surgery with moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest. However, erythropoietin significantly reduced cardiac complications, and lowered the incidence of prolonged vasopressor dependence."

      Dynamic Coronary Roadmap (DCR) is a software tool that creates a real-time dynamic coronary artery overlay on fluoroscopic images. The efficacy of DCR in significantly reducing contrast medium use during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) has previously been shown. In this study, we aimed to determine if DCR is equally effective irrespective of the performing investigator's experience level.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this sub-analysis of a monocentric, open-label, randomized trial, 130 patients with hemodynamic relevant coronary type A and B lesions were randomized and contrast medium use was conducted with (+) or without (-) DCR software. PCI was randomly allocated and performed by an investigator with high (A) or medium (B) experience level.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, contrast medium use was significantly reduced by both investigators in the +DCR group, and Investigator B used significantly less contrast medium with the software than Investigator A. The DCR software was not accompanied by increased radiation exposure for the patients or the teams. On the contrary, dose area product was reduced by both investigators, but was significantly reduced by the highly experienced investigator when using DCR. Fluoroscopy time was not different between investigators. Procedural success was 100%. Serious in-hospital adverse events were not observed. One of Investigator A's patients suffered from post-procedural acute kidney injury in the -DCR group.

Proenkephalin A 119-159 predicts early and successful liberation from renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: a post hoc analysis of the ELAIN trial.,"Thilo von Groote#, Felix Albert#, Melanie Meersch, Raphael Koch, Christian Porschen, Oliver Hartmann, Deborah Bergmann, Peter Pickkers, Alexander Zarbock, Thilo von Grooteet al.",2022 Oct 31,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36316692/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Renal replacement therapy (RRT) remains the key rescue therapy for critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI). However, there are currently no tools available to predict successful liberation from RRT. Biomarkers may allow for risk stratification and individualization of treatment strategies. Proenkephalin A 119-159 (penKid) has been suggested as a promising marker of kidney function in the context of AKI, but has not yet been evaluated for RRT liberation in critically ill patients with AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This post hoc analysis included 210 patients from the randomized clinical ELAIN trial and penKid levels were measured in the blood of these patients. Competing risk time-to-event analyses were performed for pre-RRT penKid at initiation of RRT and in a landmark analysis at day 3 after initiation of RRT. Competing risk endpoints were successful liberation from RRT or death without prior liberation from RRT.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Low pre-RRT penKid levels (penKid ≤ 89 pmol/l) at RRT initiation were associated with early and successful liberation from RRT compared to patients with high pre-RRT penKid levels (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.83, 95%CI 1.26-2.67, p = 0.002, estimated 28d-cumulative incidence function (28d-CIF) of successful liberation from RRT 61% vs. 45%, p = 0.022). This association persisted in the landmark analysis on day 3 of RRT (sHR 1.78, 95%CI 1.17-2.71, p = 0.007, 28d-CIF of successful liberation from RRT 67% vs. 47%, p = 0.018). For both time points, no difference in the competing event of death was detected.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In critically ill patients with RRT-dependent AKI, plasma penKid appears to be a useful biomarker for the prediction of shorter duration and successful liberation from RRT and may allow an individualized approach to guide strategies of RRT liberation in critically ill patients with RRT-dependent AKI.

Effect of Delayed Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Acute Kidney Injury and Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Ping Jia#, Qiang Ji#, Zhouping Zou, Qi Zeng, Ting Ren, Weize Chen, Zhixin Yan, Daoqi Shen, Yang Li, Fangyuan Peng, Ying Su, Jiarui Xu, Bo Shen, Zhe Luo, Chunsheng Wang, Xiaoqiang Ding, Ping Jiaet al.",2024 Oct 22,Circulation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39319450/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has 2 time windows for organ protection: acute and delayed. Previous studies have mainly focused on the organoprotective effects of acute RIPC. We aimed to determine whether delayed RIPC can reduce the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial involved 509 patients at high risk for AKI who were scheduled for elective cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomized to receive RIPC (4 cycles of 5-minute inflation and 5-minute deflation on 1 upper arm with a blood pressure cuff) 24 hours before surgery or a sham condition (control group) that was induced by 4 cycles of 5-minute inflation to a pressure of 20 mm Hg followed by 5-minute cuff deflation. The primary end point was the incidence of AKI within the prior 7 days after cardiac surgery. The secondary end points included renal replacement therapy during hospitalization, change in urinary biomarkers of AKI and markers of myocardial injury, duration of intensive care unit stay and mechanical ventilation, and occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality by day 90.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 509 patients (mean age, 65.2±8.2 years; 348 men [68.4%]) were randomly assigned to the RIPC group (n=254) or control group (n=255). AKI was significantly reduced in the RIPC group compared with the control group (69/254 [27.2%] versus 90/255 [35.3%]; odds ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.47-1.00]; P=0.048). There were no significant between-group differences in the secondary end points of perioperative myocardial injury (assessed by the concentrations of cardiac troponin T, creatine kinase myocardial isoenzyme, and NT-proBNP [N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide]), duration of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, and occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality by day 90.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery, delayed RIPC significantly reduced the occurrence of AKI.

          Predictor:
        
      
      Unadjusted postoperative urinary biomarkers of AKI measured within 6 hours of surgery.
    


          Outcome:
        
      
      AKI was defined as AKI Network stage 1 (any AKI) or higher, as well as a doubling of serum creatinine level from the preoperative value or the need for post-operative dialysis (severe AKI).
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      Stratified analyses by preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤ 60 versus > 60mL/min/1.73m(2).
    


          Results:
        
      
      180 (42%) patients with preoperative eGFRs≤60mL/min/1.73m(2) developed clinical AKI compared with 246 (31%) of those with eGFRs>60mL/min/1.73m(2) (P<0.001). For log2-transformed biomarker concentrations, there was a significant interaction between any AKI and baseline eGFR for interleukin 18 (P=0.007) and borderline significance for liver-type fatty acid binding protein (P=0.06). For all biomarkers, the adjusted relative risk (RR) point estimates for the risk for any AKI were higher in those with elevated baseline eGFRs compared with those with eGFRs≤60mL/min/1.73m(2). However, the difference in magnitude of these risks was low (adjusted RRs were 1.04 [95% CI, 0.99-1.09] and 1.11 [95% CI, 1.07-1.15] for those with preoperative eGFRs≤60mL/min/1.73m(2) and those with higher eGFRs, respectively). Although no biomarker displayed an interaction for baseline eGFR and severe AKI, log2-transformed interleukin 18 and kidney injury molecule 1 had significant adjusted RRs for severe AKI in those with and without baseline eGFRs≤60mL/min/1.73m(2).
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Limited numbers of patients with severe AKI and post-operative dialysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The association between early postoperative AKI urinary biomarkers and AKI is modified by preoperative eGFR. The degree of this modification and its impact on the biomarker-AKI association is small across biomarkers. Our findings suggest that distinct biomarker cutoffs for those with and without a preoperative eGFR≤60mL/min/1.73m(2) is not necessary."

      This study focuses on biomarkers in infants after open heart surgery, and examines the association of high-sensitive troponin T (hs-cTnT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) with postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), ventilatory support time and need of vasoactive drugs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Secondary exploratory study from a double-blinded clinical randomized trial (Mile-1) on 70 infants undergoing open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In this sub-study, the entire study population was examined without considering the study drugs. The biomarkers' peak concentration (highest concentration at 2 or 6 h post-CPB) were used for statistical analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Peak IL-8, hs-cTnT, and IL-6 occurred at 2 h post-CPB for 96%, 79%, and 63% of the patients, respectively. The odds ratio of developing AKI2-3 for IL-6 > 293 pg/mL was 23.4 (95% CI 5.3;104.0), for IL-8 > 100 pg/mL it was 11.5 (3.0;44.2), and for hs-cTnT >5597 pg/mL it was 6.1 (1.5; 24.5). In more than two third of the patients with the highest peak concentrations of IL-8, IL-6, and hs-cTnT, there was a need for ventilatory support for >24 h and use of vasoactive drugs at 24 h post-CPB, while in less than one third of the patients with the lowest peak concentrations of IL-8 and hs-cTnT such requirements were observed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The peak biomarker concentrations and CPB-time strongly predicted AKI2-3, with IL-6 and IL-8 emerging as strongest predictors. Furthermore, our findings suggest that measuring hs-cTnT and IL-8 just 2 h post-CPB-weaning may assist in identifying infants suitable for early extubation and highlight those at risk of prolonged ventilation."

          Design and setting:
        
      
      Between October 2019 and December 2020, this randomized controlled trial was carried out at a tertiary hospital in Chongqing, China.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      86 patients aged 60-75 who underwent long-duration (> 4 hrs) hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery without significant comorbidities were enrolled and randomly assigned into two groups at a 1:1 ratio.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were given either Dex or an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline (Placebo) with a loading dose of 1 μg kg-1 for 10 min, followed by 0.5 μg kg-1 hr-1 for maintenance until the end of surgery.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      The changes in serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were primary outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At one hour postoperatively, serum IL-6 displayed a nine-fold increase (P<0.05) in the Placebo group. Administration of Dex decreased IL-6 to 278.09 ± 45.43 pg/mL (95% CI: 187.75 to 368.43) compared to the Placebo group (P=0.019; 432.16 ± 45.43 pg/mL, 95% CI: 341.82 to 522.50). However, no significant differences in TNF-α were observed between the two groups. The incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury was twice as high in the Placebo group (9.30%) compared to the Dex group (4.65%), and the incidence of postoperative acute lung injury was 23.26% in the Dex group, lower than that in the Placebo group (30.23%), although there was no statistical significance between the two groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Dex administration in elderly patients undergoing major hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery reduces inflammation and potentially protects kidneys and lungs.

Hierarchical endpoints in critical care: A post-hoc exploratory analysis of the standard versus accelerated initiation of renal-replacement therapy in acute kidney injury and the intensity of continuous renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients trials.,"Fernando G Zampieri, Ary Serpa-Neto, Ron Wald, Rinaldo Bellomo, Sean M Bagshaw                              ;, STARRT-AKI and RENAL Investigators, Fernando G Zampieriet al.",2024 Aug:82:154767.,J Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38461657/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      To perform a post-hoc reanalysis of the Standard versus Accelerated Initiation of Renal-Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury (STARRT-AKI) and the Intensity of Continuous Renal-Replacement Therapy in Critically Ill Patients (RENAL) trials through hierarchical composite endpoint analysis using win ratio (WR).
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      All patients with complete information from the STARRT-AKI (which compared accelerated versus standard approaches for renal replacement therapy - RRT initiation) and RENAL (which compared two different RRT doses in critically ill patients) trials were selected. WR was defined as a hierarchical composite endpoint using 90-day mortality, RRT dependency at 90-days, intensive care unit (ICU) length-of-stay (LOS), and hospital LOS (primary analysis); values above the unit represent a benefit of the intervention for the hierarchical composite endpoint. A secondary analysis replacing LOS by days alive and free of RRT was performed. Stratified analyses were performed according to illness severity score, surgical status, and the presence of sepsis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The WR analysis produced 2,141,830 pairs for the STARRT-AKI trial and 536,446 pairs for the RENAL trial, respectively. The WR results for STARRT-AKI and RENAL were 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.13; p = 0.33) and 1.02 (95% CI; 0.90-1.15; p = 0.75) for the primary analysis, and 0.88 (95% CI; 0.79-0.99; p = 0.03) and 1.02 (95% CI; 0.87-1.21; p = 0.77) for the secondary analysis, respectively. The stratified analysis of the primary suggested possible benefit of the accelerated-strategy in the STARRT-AKI trial for non-surgical patients with sepsis, while the secondary analysis suggested possible harm of the accelerated-strategy for surgical patients without sepsis. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects in stratified analyses in the RENAL trial.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      WR approach using a hierarchical composite endpoint is feasible for trials in critical care nephrology. The primary re-analyses of the STARRT-AKI and RENAL trials both yielded neutral results; however, there was suggestion of heterogeneity in treatment effect in stratified analyses of the STARRT-AKI trial by surgical status and sepsis. Selection of the endpoints and hierarchical ordering before trial design using the WR approach can have important implications for trial interpretation.

High Loading Dose of Atorvastatin for the Prevention of Serum Creatinine and Cystatin C-Based Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,"Naikuan Fu, Min Liang, Shicheng Yang, Naikuan Fuet al.",2018 Sep,Angiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29343076/,"atorvastatin, contrast-induced nephropathy, cystatin C.",The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of high-dose atorvastatin on the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous intervention and observe the incidence of cystatin C (CyC)-based CIN. A total of 496 patients with ACS were randomly assigned to either the control group (247 patients receiving conventional dose atorvastatin 10 mg daily from 1 day before to 3 days after contrast administration) or the high-dose atorvastatin group (249 patients receiving atorvastatin 40 mg daily for the same perioperative period). The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were similar. The primary end point of serum creatinine (SCr)-based CIN occurred in 31 patients in the control group and 16 patients in the high-dose atorvastatin group (12.6% vs 6.4%; P = .02). Cystatin C-based CIN developed in 90 patients in the control group and 46 patients in the high-dose atorvastatin group (36.4% vs 18.5%; P < .001). A multivariable analysis revealed that high-dose atorvastatin was independently associated with a decreased risk of CIN. Our study demonstrated that prophylactic treatment with high-dose atorvastatin reduced the risk of both SCr and CyC-based CIN and suggested that CyC was a more reliable marker for early diagnosis of CIN compared with SCr.

      Acute kidney injury is the most frequent complication in patients with septic shock and is an independent risk factor for death. Although renal-replacement therapy is the standard of care for severe acute kidney injury, the ideal time for initiation remains controversial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned patients with early-stage septic shock who had severe acute kidney injury at the failure stage of the risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) classification system but without life-threatening complications related to acute kidney injury to receive renal-replacement therapy either within 12 hours after documentation of failure-stage acute kidney injury (early strategy) or after a delay of 48 hours if renal recovery had not occurred (delayed strategy). The failure stage of the RIFLE classification system is characterized by a serum creatinine level 3 times the baseline level (or ≥4 mg per deciliter with a rapid increase of ≥0.5 mg per deciliter), urine output less than 0.3 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour for 24 hours or longer, or anuria for at least 12 hours. The primary outcome was death at 90 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial was stopped early for futility after the second planned interim analysis. A total of 488 patients underwent randomization; there were no significant between-group differences in the characteristics at baseline. Among the 477 patients for whom follow-up data at 90 days were available, 58% of the patients in the early-strategy group (138 of 239 patients) and 54% in the delayed-strategy group (128 of 238 patients) had died (P=0.38). In the delayed-strategy group, 38% (93 patients) did not receive renal-replacement therapy. Criteria for emergency renal-replacement therapy were met in 17% of the patients in the delayed-strategy group (41 patients).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients with septic shock who had severe acute kidney injury, there was no significant difference in overall mortality at 90 days between patients who were assigned to an early strategy for the initiation of renal-replacement therapy and those who were assigned to a delayed strategy.

Fluid balance and renal replacement therapy initiation strategy: a secondary analysis of the STARRT-AKI trial.,"Ron Wald, Brian Kirkham, Bruno R daCosta, Ehsan Ghamarian, Neill K J Adhikari, William Beaubien-Souligny, Rinaldo Bellomo, Martin P Gallagher, Stuart Goldstein, Eric A J Hoste, Kathleen D Liu, Javier A Neyra, Marlies Ostermann, Paul M Palevsky, Antoine Schneider, Suvi T Vaara, Sean M Bagshaw, Ron Waldet al.",2022 Nov 24,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36424662/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), earlier initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) may mitigate fluid accumulation and confer better outcomes among individuals with greater fluid overload at randomization.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a pre-planned post hoc analysis of the STandard versus Accelerated initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury (STARRT-AKI) trial. We evaluated the effect of accelerated RRT initiation on cumulative fluid balance over the course of 14 days following randomization using mixed models after censoring for death and ICU discharge. We assessed the modifying effect of baseline fluid balance on the impact of RRT initiation strategy on key clinical outcomes. Patients were categorized in quartiles of baseline fluid balance, and the effect of accelerated versus standard RRT initiation on clinical outcomes was assessed in each quartile using risk ratios (95% CI) for categorical variables and mean differences (95% CI) for continuous variables.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 2927 patients in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 2738 had available data on baseline fluid balance and 2716 (92.8%) had at least one day of fluid balance data following randomization. Over the subsequent 14 days, participants allocated to the accelerated strategy had a lower cumulative fluid balance compared to those in the standard strategy (4509 (- 728 to 11,698) versus 5646 (0 to 13,151) mL, p = 0.03). Accelerated RRT initiation did not confer greater 90-day survival in any of the baseline fluid balance quartiles (quartile 1: RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.34), quartile 2: RR 1.03 (0.87 to 1.21); quartile 3: RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.27) and quartile 4: RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.03), p value for trend 0.08).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Earlier RRT initiation in critically ill patients with AKI conferred a modest attenuation of cumulative fluid balance. Nonetheless, among patients with greater fluid accumulation at randomization, accelerated RRT initiation did not have an impact on all-cause mortality.

Comparison of Urine Output among Patients Treated with More Intensive Versus Less Intensive RRT: Results from the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study.,"Finnian R Mc Causland, Josephine Asafu-Adjei, Rebecca A Betensky, Paul M Palevsky, Sushrut S Waikar, Finnian R Mc Causlandet al.",2016 Aug 8,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27449661/,No keywords found,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Intensive RRT may have adverse effects that account for the absence of benefit observed in randomized trials of more intensive versus less intensive RRT. We wished to determine the association of more intensive RRT with changes in urine output as a marker of worsening residual renal function in critically ill patients with severe AKI.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      The Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study (n=1124) was a multicenter trial that randomized critically ill patients requiring initiation of RRT to more intensive (hemodialysis or sustained low-efficiency dialysis six times per week or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration at 35 ml/kg per hour) versus less intensive (hemodialysis or sustained low-efficiency dialysis three times per week or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration at 20 ml/kg per hour) RRT. Mixed linear regression models were fit to estimate the association of RRT intensity with change in daily urine output in survivors through day 7 (n=871); Cox regression models were fit to determine the association of RRT intensity with time to ≥50% decline in urine output in all patients through day 28.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean age of participants was 60±15 years old, 72% were men, and 30% were diabetic. In unadjusted models, among patients who survived ≥7 days, mean urine output was, on average, 31.7 ml/d higher (95% confidence interval, 8.2 to 55.2 ml/d) for the less intensive group compared with the more intensive group (P=0.01). More intensive RRT was associated with 29% greater unadjusted risk of decline in urine output of ≥50% (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.51).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      More intensive versus less intensive RRT is associated with a greater reduction in urine output during the first 7 days of therapy and a greater risk of developing a decline in urine output of ≥50% in critically ill patients with severe AKI."
A risk prediction model for contrast-induced nephropathy associated with gadolinium-based contrast agents.,"Huanhuan Zheng, Guolang Wang, Qianqian Cao, Wenkai Ren, Lingyuan Xu, Shuangshan Bu, Huanhuan Zhenget al.",2022 Dec,Ren Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35509178/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      This is the first study to explore the risk factors for nephropathy caused by gadolinium-based contrast agents and establish a prediction model to identify high-risk patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 1404 patients who received gadolinium-based contrast agents in our hospital were included. The participants were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to the modeling and validation groups. The modeling group was divided into a contrast-induced nephropathy group and a non-contrast-induced nephropathy group. The clinical characteristics before the use of contrast agents were compared between the two groups. The risk factors for contrast-induced nephropathy were analyzed by logistic regression. A nomogram that could predict the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy was plotted. The validation group was used to verify the predictive model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy caused by gadolinium-based contrast agents was 3.92% (55/1404). The logistic stepwise regression analysis showed that sex, systolic pressure (SBP), absolute neutrophil count, albumin, fasting blood glucose level, and furosemide use were significant predictors of contrast-induced nephropathy caused by gadolinium-based contrast agents. The above predictors were then included in the nomogram construction. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.82 (p < 0.001). The specificity and sensitivity corresponding to the optimal cutoff point (0.039) based on the area under the ROC curve were 71.9% and 80.5%, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Sex, SBP, absolute neutrophil count, albumin, fasting blood glucose levels, and furosemide use are significant predictors of contrast-induced nephropathy caused by gadolinium-based contrast agents. Therefore, the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy may be estimated by the prediction model established in this study before the use of contrast agents."
Impact of Finerenone-Induced Albuminuria Reduction on Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes : A Mediation Analysis.,"Rajiv Agarwal, Wanzhu Tu, Alfredo E Farjat, Youssef M K Farag, Robert Toto, Sanjay Kaul, Robert Lawatscheck, Katja Rohwedder, Luis M Ruilope, Peter Rossing, Bertram Pitt, Gerasimos Filippatos, Stefan D Anker, George L Bakris                              ;, FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD Investigators, Rajiv Agarwalet al.",2023 Dec,Ann Intern Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38048573/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, reduces cardiovascular and kidney failure outcomes. Finerenone also lowers the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). Whether finerenone-induced change in UACR mediates cardiovascular and kidney failure outcomes is unknown.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To quantify the proportion of kidney and cardiovascular risk reductions seen over a 4-year period mediated by a change in kidney injury, as measured by the change in log UACR between baseline and month 4.

          Measurements:
        
      
      Separate mediation analyses were done for the composite kidney (kidney failure, sustained ≥57% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline [approximately a doubling of serum creatinine], or kidney disease death) and cardiovascular (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At baseline, median UACR was 514 mg/g. A 30% or greater reduction in UACR was seen in 3338 (53.2%) patients in the finerenone group and 1684 (27.0%) patients in the placebo group. Reduction in UACR (analyzed as a continuous variable) mediated 84% and 37% of the treatment effect on the kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, respectively. When change in UACR was analyzed as a binary variable (that is, whether the guideline-recommended 30% reduction threshold was met), the proportions mediated for each outcome were 64% and 26%, respectively.
    


          Limitation:
        
      
      The current findings are not readily extendable to other drugs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In patients with CKD and T2D, early albuminuria reduction accounted for a large proportion of the treatment effect against CKD progression and a modest proportion of the effect against cardiovascular outcomes.

Etiology and renal outcomes of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis: a single-center prospective cohort study in China.,"Tao Su, Yanghui Gu, Pingping Sun, Jiawei Tang, Suxia Wang, Gang Liu, Xiaomei Li, Li Yang, Tao Suet al.",2018 Jul 1,Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28992223/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to explore the etiology, long-term renal outcomes and affecting factors of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with biopsy-proven ATIN from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2013 at Peking University First Hospital were enrolled in the study and received scheduled follow-up for at least 24 months. The causes of ATIN were defined at biopsy and reclassified during follow-up. Factors affecting renal recovery at 6 months post-biopsy and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 12 months post-biopsy and at the end of follow-up were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 157 ATIN patients were enrolled, with an average follow-up of 48 months (range 24-108 months). A modified etiology spectrum was identified, with a decreased proportion of drug-induced ATIN (D-ATIN, 64% at biopsy to 50% after follow-up) and an increase in autoimmune-related ATIN (22-41%) with late-onset systemic manifestations in patients who had been classified as D-ATIN or ATIN of unknown cause. Recurrent kidney injury was observed in 51% of the patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome (TINU), 53% of those with an autoimmune disease and 8% of those with D-ATIN, resulting in prolonged immunosuppressive treatment. By 12 months, decreased eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was observed in 47% of the patients with D-ATIN, 74% of those with TINU and 57% of those with other autoimmune diseases. In multivariable analysis, female sex, older age, presence of hypertension and recurrent kidney injury were independent risk factors for worse renal outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our data demonstrate that autoimmune-related ATIN may present with systemic manifestations after kidney injury and is, therefore, commonly misdiagnosed. Repeated kidney injury is not uncommon in patients with ATIN. Scheduled follow-up is, therefore, critical for defining the exact etiology and proper management of ATIN."

      Antithrombin (AT) activity is reduced during cardiac operations with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), which is associated with adverse outcomes. Preoperative AT supplementation, to achieve >58% and <100% AT activity, may potentially reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality in cardiac operations with CPB. This prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preoperative treatment with AT supplementation in patients at risk for low AT activity after undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 425 adult patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either a single dose of AT (n = 213) to achieve an absolute increase of 20% above pretreatment AT activity or placebo (n = 212) before surgery. The study duration was approximately 7 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of patients with any component of a major morbidity composite (postoperative mortality, stroke, acute kidney injury [AKI], surgical reexploration, arterial or venous thromboembolic events, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and infection) in the 2 groups. Secondary end points included AT activity, blood loss, transfusion requirements, duration of intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital stays. Safety was also assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 399 patients (men, n = 300, 75.2%) with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 66.1 (11.7) years, with the majority undergoing complex surgical procedures (n = 266, 67.9%), were analyzed. No differences in the percentage of patients experiencing morbidity composite outcomes between groups were observed (AT-treated 68/198 [34.3%] versus placebo 58/194 [29.9%]; P = .332; relative risk, 1.15). After AT infusion, AT activity was significantly higher in the AT group (108% [42-143]) versus placebo group (76% [40-110]), and lasted up to postoperative day 2. At ICU, the frequency of patients with AT activity ≥58% in the AT group (81.5%) was significantly higher ( P < .001) versus placebo group (43.2%). Secondary end point analysis did not show any advantage of AT over placebo group. There were significantly more patients with AKI ( P < .001) in the AT group (23/198; 11.6%) than in the placebo group (5/194, 2.6%). Safety results showed no differences in treatment-emergent adverse events nor bleeding events between groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      AT supplementation did not attenuate adverse postoperative outcomes in our cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB."

      To maintain adequate oxygenation is of utmost importance in intraoperative care. However, clinical evidence supporting specific oxygen levels in distinct surgical settings is lacking. This study aimed to compare the effects of 30% and 80% oxygen in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This multicenter trial was conducted in three tertiary hospitals from August 2019 to August 2021. Patients undergoing OPCAB were cluster-randomized to receive either 30% or 80% oxygen intraoperatively, based on the month when the surgery was performed. The primary endpoint was the length of hospital stay. Intraoperative hemodynamic data were also compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 414 patients were cluster-randomized. Length of hospital stay was not different in the 30% oxygen group compared to the 80% oxygen group (median, 7.0 days vs 7.0 days; the sub-distribution hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-1.16; P = 0.808). The incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury was significantly higher in the 30% oxygen group than in the 80% oxygen group (30.7% vs 19.4%; odds ratio, 1.94; 95% CI 1.18-3.17; P = 0.036). Intraoperative time-weighted average mixed venous oxygen saturation was significantly higher in the 80% oxygen group (74% vs 64%; P < 0.001). The 80% oxygen group also had a significantly greater intraoperative time-weighted average cerebral regional oxygen saturation than the 30% oxygen group (56% vs 52%; P = 0.002).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients undergoing OPCAB, intraoperative administration of 80% oxygen did not decrease the length of hospital stay, compared to 30% oxygen, but may reduce postoperative acute kidney injury. Moreover, compared to 30% oxygen, intraoperative use of 80% oxygen improved oxygen delivery in patients undergoing OPCAB. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03945565; April 8, 2019)."
The Effects of Intensive Versus Routine Treatment in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury.,"Anja Haase-Fielitz, Saban Elitok, Martin Schostak, Martin Ernst, Berend Isermann, Christian Albert, Bernt-Peter Robra, Andreas Kribben, Michael Haase, Anja Haase-Fielitzet al.",2020 Apr 24,Dtsch Arztebl Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32530412/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      In patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), specialized treatment-initiated in response to an early-warning system- may be beneficial compared with routine treatment.
    


          Method:
        
      
      To explore effect estimators in a pilot trial (DRKS00010530), patients with AKI on regular wards of a university hospital were treated either in the usual way (control group) or more intensively (intervention group). The subjects were allotted randomly to the two treatment groups. The more intensive treatment consisted of an early warning system for a rise in the serum creatinine concentration, immediate consultation of a specialist, and the issuance of a patient kidney passport. The primary endpoint was recovery of renal function after AKI during the index hospitalization. Renal complications and process indicators were the secondary endpoints.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The proportion of patients whose renal function returned to baseline after AKI was 50% in the intervention group (N = 26) and 42% in the control group (N = 26) (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval [0.5; 4.0], p = 0.58). The calculated glomerular filtration rate went down, from hospital admission to discharge, by 3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (1st-3rd quartile: [6; -20]) in the intervention group and by 13 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the control group (1st-3rd quartile: [0; -25]; p = 0.09). Complications of AKI such as hyperkalemia, pulmonary edema, and renal acidosis were rarer in the intervention group (15% versus 39%; p = 0.03). In the intervention group, compared with the control group, the cause of AKI was identified more frequently (27% versus 4%; p = 0.05); drugs with relevance to the kidney were discontinued more frequently (65% versus 31%; p = 0.01); and the diagnosis of AKI was more frequently documented in the patient's chart (58% versus 37%; p = 0.03).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Specialized consultations supported by an early warning system for AKI seem to be beneficial for patients. The findings of this pilot trial should be verified in larger-scale randomized controlled trials."

      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a frequent complication of contrast exposure. A recent study suggested that Na/K citrate might have a preventive role. We investigated the efficacy of Na/K citrate to prevent CIN in patients with renal dysfunction undergoing coronary intervention.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 201 patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 90 mL/ min, randomized to receive oral Na/K citrate plus saline infusion (treatment group, 104 patients) or oral water plus saline infusion (placebo group, 97 patients). CIN was defined as an absolute increase of serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dL or a relative increase ≥ 25% or a relative decrease of estimated GFR ≥ 25% within 5 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CIN occurred in 22 patients (12.29%); 10 (11%) in treatment group and 12 (13.6%) in placebo group (P > .05). Post-exposure Cr values were not significantly different between the two groups (1.18 ± 0.28 mg/dL in the placebo vs. 1.15 ± 0.29 mg/dL in the treatment group, P > .05). CIN-negative patients in the treatment group showed a significantly higher increase in urine pH than that of CIN-positive patients (1.642 ± 0.577 vs. 1.20 ± 0.422, P < .05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Na/K citrate solution is not effective for prophylaxis of CIN in patients with renal dysfunction. However, a probable preventive effect might exist in a subgroup of patients with at least 1.6 units increase in urine pH values following Na/K citrate administration."
The impact of laparoscopic adrenalectomy on renal function. Results of a prospective randomised clinical trial.,"Tomasz Kozłowski, Alicja Rydzewska-Rosolowska, Janusz Myśliwiec, Barbara Choromańska, Piotr Wojskowicz, Jacek Dadan, Marta Łukaszewicz-Zając, Barbara Mroczko, Piotr Myśliwiec, Tomasz Kozłowskiet al.",2019,Endokrynol Pol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31274187/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the gold standard management of benign adrenal masses and isolated metastases to adrenal glands. Two techniques of endoscopic adrenalectomy: lateral transperitoneal approach (LTA) and posterior retroperitoneal approach (PRA) seem to be equally safe and effective. Recent studies suggest advantages of PRA over LTA in terms of lower intensity of postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, and lower early morbidity. However, PRA involves high insufflation pressure of CO₂ within a limited retroperitoneal space. The aim of our study was to prospectively assess the effect of LTA versus PRA laparoscopic adrenalectomies on renal function.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      We randomly assigned patients referred for unilateral adrenalectomy to either LTA (n = 33) or PRA (n = 44). The inclusion criteria were: hormonal activity and/or tumour diameter > 4 cm and/or suspicion of metastasis to adrenal gland. The exclusion criteria comprised: tumours > 8 cm, results of imaging studies suggesting primary invasive malignancy, and refusal to undergo randomisation. The patients were prospectively followed for a minimum of six months. Serum creatinine, cystatin C, and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured preoperatively and at postoperative days: 1, 7, and 30.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found increased concentrations of urinary NGAL at day 1 following laparoscopic adrenalectomy using PRA, as compared to LTA. Patients undergoing right-sided PRA had increased creatinine concentrations, as compared to left-sided PRA. Patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma had decreased preoperative eGFR as compared to subjects with non-functioning incidentaloma. NGAL increased significantly in this group postoperatively. All the disturbances normalised within one month postoperatively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Renal function impairment after PRA may result from compression of inferior vena cava by high retroperitoneal pressure during right-sided adrenalectomy. Despite the transient character of the observed abnormalities, we suggest that patients with high risk of acute kidney injury may benefit from an alternative technique of adrenalectomy using LTA."

      The efficacy and safety of renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockers (RAASB's) if introduced immediately after renal transplantation have not been extensively investigated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The medical charts of 142 kidney transplant recipients who received a RAASB in the early postoperative period and of 114 matched controls were analyzed. The RAASB was given primarily for blood pressure control.
    


          Results:
        
      
      117 patients continued to receive and 50 controls remained continuously free of the RAASB in the first year. The RAASB was added on average at postoperative day 8 and the mean duration of follow-up was 5.4 years. Systolic, blood pressure at treatment initiation was increased in the RAASB group (150 ± 17 vs. 141 ± 16, p < 0.001). At discharge from hospital and during follow-up blood pressure was similar in both groups, without differences in GFR, potassium and proteinuria. The endpoints ""graft failure"" and ""graft failure or death from any cause"" were significantly better in patients treated with RAASB's (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). The treatment effects in the RAASB group persisted even after adjustment for demographic parameters, immunological risk factors, peritransplant risk factors, duration of dialysis prior to transplantation and medical comorbidities.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Thus, RAASB's can be used effectively and safely to treat hypertension in the early postoperative period after kidney transplantation and are renoprotective in the long term."

As of present, no effective therapy exists to prevent its occurrence. This single-center double-blind randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effect of edaravone, an antioxidant, in a group of high-risk patients undergoing coronary angiography. Ninety eligible patients with chronic kidney disease Stages 3-4 were randomly assigned to either the control group (n = 45) or the intervention group (n = 45). In the intervention group, one dosage of edaravone (60 mg) in 1 L of normal saline was infused via a peripheral vein 1 h prior to femoral artery-directed coronary angiography. Patients in the control group received an equal amount of infusion in their last hour before angiography. Both groups received intravenous hydration with 0.9% sodium 1 mL/kg/h starting 12 h before and continuing for 24 h after angiography. The primary outcome measure was the onset of CIN, defined as a 25% increase in serum creatinine levels 120 h after administration of contrast media. The occurrence of CIN was observed in 5.5% (n = 5) of the studied population: 2.2% of patients in the intervention group (n = 1) and 8.9% of controls (n = 4). However, this difference was not statistically significant. Administration of a single dosage of edaravone 1 h prior to infusion of contrast media led to a reduction in the incidence of CIN. Further investigations, employing larger sample sizes, are warranted to gain a comprehensive understanding of its efficacy."

      The choice of anaesthetic may influence regulation of renal perfusion and function. We investigated renal function in patients anaesthetised with propofol or sevoflurane before surgery and postoperatively.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with ASA physical status 1-2 planned for spinal surgery were randomised to propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia. Blood and urine were collected before anaesthesia, during anaesthesia (before surgery), during postoperative care, and the day after surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-seven patients completed the study protocol (average age, 51 yr; average BMI, 28 kg m-2) and 11 were women. Urine output and sodium excretion were lower during sevoflurane anaesthesia (n=14) than during propofol anaesthesia (n=13) (0.3 vs 1.1 ml kg-1 h-1 [P=0.01] and 2.6 vs 6.0 mmol h-1 [P=0.04], respectively). Urinary potassium excretion was lower during anaesthesia than after, without intergroup difference (2.3 vs 5.7 mmol h-1, P<0.001). Sevoflurane anaesthesia increased plasma renin compared with baseline (138 vs 23 mIU L-1, P<0.001) and propofol anaesthesia (138 vs 27 mIU L-1, P=0.008). Plasma arginine-vasopressin did not change significantly during anaesthesia, but was elevated postoperatively compared with baseline irrespective of anaesthetic (21 vs 12 ng L-1, P=0.02). Sevoflurane caused higher postoperative plasma creatinine than propofol (83 vs 66 mmol L-1, P=0.01). Kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin did not change significantly in either group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Sevoflurane anaesthesia reduced urine output and sodium excretion and increased plasma renin compared with propofol anaesthesia. The impact of this on acute kidney injury and fluid resuscitation during surgery warrants further investigation.

Continuous renal replacement therapy versus intermittent hemodialysis as first modality for renal replacement therapy in severe acute kidney injury: a secondary analysis of AKIKI and IDEAL-ICU studies.,"Stéphane Gaudry, François Grolleau, Saber Barbar, Laurent Martin-Lefevre, Bertrand Pons, Éric Boulet, Alexandre Boyer, Guillaume Chevrel, Florent Montini, Julien Bohe, Julio Badie, Jean-Philippe Rigaud, Christophe Vinsonneau, Raphaël Porcher, Jean-Pierre Quenot#, Didier Dreyfuss#, Stéphane Gaudryet al.",2022 Apr 4,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35379300/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are the two main RRT modalities in patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI). Meta-analyses conducted more than 10 years ago did not show survival difference between these two modalities. As the quality of RRT delivery has improved since then, we aimed to reassess whether the choice of IHD or CRRT as first modality affects survival of patients with severe AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a secondary analysis of two multicenter randomized controlled trials (AKIKI and IDEAL-ICU) that compared an early RRT initiation strategy with a delayed one. We included patients allocated to the early strategy in order to emulate a trial where patients would have been randomized to receive either IHD or CRRT within twelve hours after the documentation of severe AKI. We determined each patient's modality group as the first RRT modality they received. The primary outcome was 60-day overall survival. We used two propensity score methods to balance the differences in baseline characteristics between groups and the primary analysis relied on inverse probability of treatment weighting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 543 patients were included. Continuous RRT was the first modality in 269 patients and IHD in 274. Patients receiving CRRT had higher cardiovascular and total-SOFA scores. Inverse probability weighting allowed to adequately balance groups on all predefined confounders. The weighted Kaplan-Meier death rate at day 60 was 54·4% in the CRRT group and 46·5% in the IHD group (weighted HR 1·26, 95% CI 1·01-1·60). In a complementary analysis of less severely ill patients (SOFA score: 3-10), receiving IHD was associated with better day 60 survival compared to CRRT (weighted HR 1.82, 95% CI 1·01-3·28; p < 0.01). We found no evidence of a survival difference between the two RRT modalities in more severe patients.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Compared to IHD, CRRT as first modality seemed to convey no benefit in terms of survival or of kidney recovery and might even have been associated with less favorable outcome in patients with lesser severity of disease. A prospective randomized non-inferiority trial should be implemented to solve the persistent conundrum of the optimal RRT technique."

      The generation of key uremic nephrovascular toxins, indoxyl sulfate (IS), and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), is attributed to the dysbiotic gut microbiota in CKD. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether synbiotic (pre- and probiotic) therapy alters the gut microbiota and reduces serum concentrations of microbiome-generated uremic toxins, IS and PCS, in patients with CKD.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      Predialysis adult participants with CKD (eGFR=10-30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) were recruited between January 5, 2013 and November 12, 2013 to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of synbiotic therapy over 6 weeks (4-week washout). The primary outcome was serum IS. Secondary outcomes included serum PCS, stool microbiota profile, eGFR, proteinuria-albuminuria, urinary kidney injury molecule-1, serum inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α), serum oxidative stress biomarkers (F2-isoprostanes and glutathione peroxidase), serum LPS, patient-reported health, Gastrointestinal Symptom Score, and dietary intake. A prespecified subgroup analysis explored the effect of antibiotic use on treatment effect.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 37 individuals randomized (age =69±10 years old; 57% men; eGFR=24±8 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), 31 completed the study. Synbiotic therapy did not significantly reduce serum IS (-2 μmol/L; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -5 to 1 μmol/L) but did significantly reduce serum PCS (-14 μmol/L; 95% CI, -27 to -2 μmol/L). Decreases in both PCS and IS concentrations were more pronounced in patients who did not receive antibiotics during the study (n=21; serum PCS, -25 μmol/L; 95% CI, -38 to -12 μmol/L; serum IS, -5 μmol/L; 95% CI, -8 to -1 μmol/L). Synbiotics also altered the stool microbiome, particularly with enrichment of Bifidobacterium and depletion of Ruminococcaceae. Except for an increase in albuminuria of 38 mg/24 h (P=0.03) in the synbiotic arm, no changes were observed in the other secondary outcomes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In patients with CKD, synbiotics did not significantly reduce serum IS but did decrease serum PCS and favorably modified the stool microbiome. Large-scale clinical trials are justified."

      Of 282 eligible subjects with an initial creatinine obtained within 24 h of randomization, 148 were randomized to therapeutic hypothermia and 134 were randomized to therapeutic normothermia.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Primary outcome was prevalence of severe AKI, as defined by stage 2 and 3 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus definition; secondary outcome was survival with a favorable neurobehavioral outcome. For this study, risk factors and outcomes were compared between those with/without severe AKI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 282 subjects enrolled, 180 (64%) developed AKI of which 117 (41% of all enrolled) developed severe AKI. Multivariable modeling found younger age, longer duration of chest compressions, higher lactate level at time of temperature intervention and higher number of vasoactive agents through day 1 of intervention associated with severe AKI. There was no difference in severe AKI between therapeutic hypothermia (39.9%) and therapeutic normothermia (43.3%) groups (p = 0.629). Survival was lower in those with severe AKI at 28 days (21% vs no severe AKI 49%, p < 0.001) and 12 months (21% vs no severe AKI 42%, p < 0.001). One year survival with favorable functional outcome was lower in those with severe AKI.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Severe AKI occurs frequently in children with ROSC after OHCA, especially in younger children and those with higher initial lactates and hemodynamic support. Severe AKI was associated with worse survival and functional outcome. Therapeutic hypothermia did not reduce the incidence of severe AKI."
Clinical implication of renal dysfunction during the clinical course in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: a longitudinal analysis.,"Jin Seok Kim, June-Won Cheong, Yeung-Chul Mun, Jun Ho Jang, Deog-Yeon Jo, Jong Wook Lee                              ;, Aplastic Anemia Working Party of the Korean Society of Hematology, Jin Seok Kimet al.",2019 Oct,Ann Hematol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31256219/,"Mortality, Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, Renal dysfunction, Thromboembolism.","Although renal dysfunction at the time of diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a risk factor for mortality, subsequent renal events can occur. The objective of this study was to identify clinical implication of renal dysfunction occurring during the disease course in PNH patients. One hundred one patients with a granulocyte clone size of > 10% were enrolled. Renal events were observed in 55 (54.5%) patients during a median follow-up of 94.2 months. Median time to first renal event from diagnosis of PNH was 79.3 months. Thromboembolism (TE) event and recurrent TE events were observed in 25 (24.8%) and 8 (7.9%) patients, respectively. The rate of recurrent TE was significantly higher in patients with renal events ≥ 2 compared with that in patients with renal event ≤ 1 (18.8% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.012). The rate of recurrent TE was significantly higher in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) + acute kidney disease (AKD) compared with the rest of the patients (27.3% vs. 5.6%; P = 0.040). CKD+AKD was the only independent risk factor for OS in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 7.95, 95% CI 1.24-51.15, P = 0.029). Therefore, close monitoring of renal events in PNH patients during the entire clinical course is essential."
Ultrasound dynamic monitoring of IVCD to guide application of CRRT in patients with renal failure combined with acute heart failure.,"Guang Yu, Shaoyu Tao, Yingzhi Jin, Wanxia Li, Zanqun Hu, Xiaowei Fang, Guang Yuet al.",2022 Aug 18,Sci Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35982101/,No keywords found,"We explored the application value of bedside ultrasound dynamic monitoring of the inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD) and collapse with sniff (inferior vena cava collapsibility index [IVCCI]) to guide dehydration adjustment in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in patients with combined renal failure and acute heart failure. We selected 90 patients with combined renal and acute heart failure who required CRRT in the intensive care unit (ICU) from January 2019 to June 2021. According to different blood volume assessment methods, patients were randomly divided into ultrasound, experience, and control groups. We compared serum creatinine, potassium, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels; time to improved heart failure symptoms; CRRT time; ventilator use; ICU length of stay; vasopressor use; and incidence of adverse events among groups. There were no significant differences in serum creatinine, potassium, and NT-proBNP levels in pairwise comparisons among groups before and after CRRT (P > 0.05). The time to improved heart failure symptoms, CRRT time, and ICU length of stay in the ultrasound and experience groups were lower than those in the control group; the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Ventilator use duration was lower in the ultrasound and experience groups compared with the control group, with a statistically significant difference between the ultrasound and control groups (P < 0.05). The duration of vasopressor use in the ultrasound and control groups was lower than that in the experience group; the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse events was lower in the ultrasound group compared with the experience and control groups; the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Ultrasound dynamic monitoring of IVCD and collapse with sniff can accurately assess blood volume status, and provide guidance for dehydration adjustments in CRRT and rapid relief of heart failure symptoms in patients with combined renal and acute heart failure."
Relationship between Stroke Volume Variation and Blood Transfusion during Liver Transplantation.,"Jae Moon Choi, Yoon Kyung Lee, Hwanhee Yoo, Sukyung Lee, Hee Yeong Kim, Young-Kug Kim, Jae Moon Choiet al.",2016 Feb 20,Int J Med Sci,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26941584/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Intraoperative blood transfusion increases the risk for perioperative mortality and morbidity in liver transplant recipients. A high stroke volume variation (SVV) method has been proposed to reduce blood loss during living donor hepatectomy. Herein, we investigated whether maintaining high SVV could reduce the need for blood transfusion and also evaluated the effect of the high SVV method on postoperative outcomes in liver transplant recipients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively analyzed 332 patients who underwent liver transplantation, divided into control (maintaining <10% of SVV during surgery) and high SVV (maintaining 10-20% of SVV during surgery) groups. We evaluated the blood transfusion requirement and hemodynamic parameters, including SVV, as well as postoperative outcomes, such as incidences of acute kidney injury, durations of postoperative intensive care unit and hospital stay, and rates of 1-year mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean SVV values were 7.0% ± 1.3% in the control group (n = 288) and 11.2% ± 1.8% in the high SVV group (n = 44). The median numbers of transfused packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasmas in the high SVV group were significantly lower than those in control group (0 vs. 2 units, P = 0.003; and 0 vs. 3 units, P = 0.033, respectively). No significant between-group differences were observed for postoperative outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Maintaining high SVV can reduce the blood transfusion requirement during liver transplantation without worsening postoperative outcomes. These findings provide insights into improving perioperative management in liver transplant recipients."

      In DanGer Shock (the Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock trial), use of a microaxial flow pump (mAFP) in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock led to lower all-cause mortality but higher rates of renal replacement therapy (RRT). In this prespecified analysis, rates and predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI) and RRT were assessed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this international, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial, 355 adult patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock were randomized to mAFP (n=179) or standard care alone (n=176). AKI was defined according to RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) and assessed using logistic regression models. Use of RRT was assessed accounting for the competing risk of death using Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      AKI (RIFLE ≥1) was recorded in 110 patients (61%) in the mAFP group and 79 patients (45%) in the control group (P<0.01); RRT was used in 75 (42%) and 47 (27%) patients, respectively (P<0.01). About two-thirds of the RRTs were initiated within the first 24 hours from admission (n=48 [64%] in the mAFP group and n=31 [66%] in the control group). Occurrence of AKI and RRT were associated with higher 180-day mortality in both study arms. At 180 days, all patients alive were free of RRT. mAFP use was associated with higher rates of RRT, even when accounting for competing risk of death (subdistribution hazard, 1.67 [1.18-2.35]). This association was largely consistent among prespecified subgroups. Allocation to mAFP was associated with lower 180-day mortality irrespective of AKI or RRT (Pinteraction=0.84). Relevant predictors of AKI in both groups comprised reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, baseline kidney function, shock severity, bleeding events, and positive fluid balance. Predictors of AKI specific to mAFP were suction events, higher pump speed, and longer duration of support.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Shock severity, allocation to mAFP, and device-related complications were associated with an increased risk of AKI. AKI was generally associated with higher mortality, but the allocation to mAFP consistently led to lower mortality rates at 180 days irrespective of the occurrence of AKI with or without RRT initiation.

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a highly morbid condition in critically ill patients that is associated with high mortality. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD) in the treatment of AKI requiring continuous renal replacement therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU).
    


          Design, setting, patients:
        
      
      A randomized, controlled trial of 134 ICU patients with AKI, 69 received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) alone and 65 received SCD therapy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No significant difference in 60-day mortality was observed between the treated (27/69; 39%) and control patients (21/59; 36%, with six patients lost to follow up) in the intention to treat (ITT) analysis. Of the 19 SCD subjects (CRRT+SCD) and 31 control subjects (CRRT alone) who maintained a post-filter ionized calcium (iCa) level in the protocol's recommended range (≤ 0.4 mmol/L) for greater or equal to 90% of the therapy time, 60-day mortality was 16% (3/19) in the SCD group compared to 41% (11/27) in the CRRT alone group (p = 0.11). Dialysis dependency showed a borderline statistically significant difference between the SCD treated versus control CRRT alone patients maintained for ≥ 90% of the treatment in the protocol's recommended (r) iCa target range of ≤ 0.4 mmol/L with values of, 0% (0/16) and 25% (4/16), respectively (P = 0.10). When the riCa treated and control subgroups were compared for a composite index of 60 day mortality and dialysis dependency, the percentage of SCD treated subjects was 16% versus 58% in the control subjects (p<0.01). The incidence of serious adverse events did not differ between the treated (45/69; 65%) and control groups (40/65; 63%; p = 0·86).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      SCD therapy may improve mortality and reduce dialysis dependency in a tightly controlled regional hypocalcaemic environment in the perfusion circuit.

Applying bio-impedance vector analysis (BIVA) to adjust ultrafiltration rate in critically ill patients on continuous renal replacement therapy: A randomized controlled trial.,"Farin Rashid Farokhi, Effat Kalateh, Shadi Shafaghi, Antoine Guillaume Schneider, Seyed Mehdi Mortazavi, Hamidreza Jamaati, Seyed Mohammad Reza Hashemian, Farin Rashid Farokhiet al.",2022 Dec:72:154146.,J Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36116287/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) has been suggested as a valuable tool in assessing volume status in critically ill patients. However, its effectiveness in guiding fluid removal by continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has not been evaluated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomized controlled trial, 65 critically ill patients receiving CRRT were allocated on a 1:1 ratio to have UF prescribed and adjusted using BIVA fluid assessment in the intervention group (32 patients) or conventional clinical parameters (33 patients). The primary outcome was the lean body mass (LBM) water content at CRRT discontinuation, and the secondary outcomes included the mortality rate, urinary output, the duration of ventilation support, and ICU stay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study group was associated with a lower water content of LBM (80.7 ± 9.4 vs. 85.9 ± 10.4%; p < 0.05), and a higher mean UF-rate and urinary output (1.5 ± 0.8 vs. 1.2 ± 0.5 ml/kg/h and 0.9 ± 0.9 vs 0.5 ± 0.6 ml/kg/h, both: p < 0.05). The mortality rate, the length of ICU stay, and ventilation support duration were similar.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      BIVA guided UF prescription may be associated with a lower rate of fluid overload. Larger studies are required to evaluate its impact on patients' outcomes."
Myoglobin clearance with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis using high cutoff dialyzer versus continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration using high-flux dialyzer: a prospective randomized controlled trial.,"Lorenz Weidhase, Jonathan de Fallois, Elena Haußig, Thorsten Kaiser, Meinhard Mende, Sirak Petros, Lorenz Weidhaseet al.",2020 Nov 11,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33176824/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Myoglobin clearance in acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy is important because myoglobin has direct renal toxic effects. Clinical data comparing different modalities of renal replacement therapy addressing myoglobin clearance are limited. This study aimed to compare two renal replacement modalities regarding myoglobin clearance.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective, randomized, single-blinded, single-center trial, 70 critically ill patients requiring renal replacement therapy were randomized 1:1 into an intervention arm using continuous veno-venous hemodialysis with high cutoff dialyzer and a control arm using continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration postdilution with high-flux dialyzer. Regional citrate anticoagulation was used in both groups to maintain the extracorporeal circuit. The concentrations of myoglobin, urea, creatinine, β2-microglobulin, interleukin-6 and albumin were measured before and after the dialyzer at 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after initiating continuous renal replacement therapy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-three patients were allocated to the control arm (CVVHDF with high-flux dialyzer) and 35 patients to the intervention arm (CVVHD with high cutoff dialyzer). Myoglobin clearance, as a primary endpoint, was significantly better in the intervention arm than in the control arm throughout the whole study period. The clearance values for urea and creatinine were higher in the control arm. There was no measurable albumin clearance in both arms. The clearance data for β2-microglobulin and interleukin-6 were non-inferior in the intervention arm compared to those for the control arm. Dialyzer lifespan was 57.0 [38.0, 72.0] hours in the control arm and 70.0 [56.75, 72.0] hours in the intervention arm (p = 0.029).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Myoglobin clearance using continuous veno-venous hemodialysis with high cutoff dialyzer and regional citrate anticoagulation is better than that with continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration with regional citrate anticoagulation.

The Effects of Targeted Changes in Systemic Blood Flow and Mean Arterial Pressure on Urine Oximetry During Cardiopulmonary Bypass.,"Raymond Hu, Fumitaka Yanase, Peter McCall, Roger Evans, Jaishankar Raman, Rinaldo Bellomo, Raymond Huet al.",2022 Sep,J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35718621/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Poor medullary oxygenation is implicated in the evolution of acute kidney injury. The authors sought to determine if increasing systemic flow and mean arterial pressure could improve urine oxygen tension (PuO2) measured in the bladder, a surrogate of kidney medullary oxygenation, in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery.
    


          Design:

          Setting:
        
      
      University-affiliated hospital.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Twenty adult patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with expected cross-clamp time of >60 minutes and estimated glomerular filtration rate of >30 mL/min/1.73m2.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Sequential 20-minute periods of 2 interventions: Intervention H (""High"") or Intervention N (""Normal""). The order of interventions was determined by randomization. Intervention H: targeted CPB flow 3.0 L/min/m2 and mean arterial pressure (MAP) 80 mmHg. Intervention N: targeted CPB flow 2.4 L/min/m2 and MAP 65 mmHg.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      PuO2 was measured by an oxygen sensor introduced into the bladder via a urinary catheter. Clear separation was achieved in CPB flow and MAP between intervention periods (p < 0.001 for group-time interaction). PuO2 during Intervention H was higher than during Intervention N (p < 0.001 for group-time interaction). After 17 minutes, PuO2 was statistically higher in Intervention H at each time point. There were no differences in markers of hemolysis between interventions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PuO2 was higher when systemic flow and MAP were increased during CPB. These findings suggest that PuO2 is responsive to changes in hemodynamics and that higher flow and pressure may improve medullary oxygenation."
Intraoperative hemodynamics and risk of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury: An observation study and a feasibility clinical trial.,"Khin M Noe, Andrea Don, Andrew D Cochrane, Michael Z L Zhu, Jennifer P Ngo, Julian A Smith, Amanda G Thrift, Johnny Vogiatjis, Andrew Martin, Rinaldo Bellomo, James McMillan, Roger G Evans, Khin M Noeet al.",2023 Nov,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37549882/,"arterial pressure, cardiopulmonary bypass, clinical perfusion, pump flow, systemic oxygen delivery.","Targeting greater pump flow and mean arterial pressure (MAP) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) could potentially alleviate renal hypoxia and reduce the risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, in an observational study of 93 patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery, we tested whether intraoperative hemodynamic management differed between patients who did and did not develop AKI. Then, in 20 patients, we assessed the feasibility of a larger-scale trial in which patients would be randomized to greater than normal target pump flow and MAP, or usual care, during CPB. In the observational cohort, MAP during hypothermic CPB averaged 68.8 ± 8.0 mmHg (mean ± SD) in the 36 patients who developed AKI and 68.9 ± 6.3 mmHg in the 57 patients who did not (p = 0.98). Pump flow averaged 2.4 ± 0.2 L/min/m2 in both groups. In the feasibility clinical trial, compared with usual care, those randomized to increased target pump flow and MAP had greater mean pump flow (2.70 ± 0.23 vs. 2.42 ± 0.09 L/min/m2 during the period before rewarming) and systemic oxygen delivery (363 ± 60 vs. 281 ± 45 mL/min/m2 ). Target MAP ≥80 mmHg was achieved in 66.6% of patients in the intervention group but in only 27.3% of patients in the usual care group. Nevertheless, MAP during CPB did not differ significantly between the two groups. We conclude that little insight was gained from our observational study regarding the impact of variations in pump flow and MAP on the risk of AKI. However, a clinical trial to assess the effects of greater target pump flow and MAP on the risk of AKI appears feasible."

      Patients who were hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection are at high risk of AKI and KRT, especially in the presence of CKD. The Dapagliflozin in Respiratory Failure in Patients with COVID-19 (DARE-19) trial showed that in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, treatment with dapagliflozin versus placebo resulted in numerically fewer participants who experienced organ failure or death, although these differences were not statistically significant. We performed a secondary analysis of the DARE-19 trial to determine the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin on kidney outcomes in the overall population and in prespecified subgroups of participants defined by baseline eGFR.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      The DARE-19 trial randomized 1250 patients who were hospitalized (231 [18%] had eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) with COVID-19 and cardiometabolic risk factors to dapagliflozin or placebo. Dual primary outcomes (time to new or worsened organ dysfunction or death, and a hierarchical composite end point of recovery [change in clinical status by day 30]), and the key secondary kidney outcome (composite of AKI, KRT, or death), and safety were assessed in participants with baseline eGFR <60 and ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The effect of dapagliflozin versus placebo on the primary prevention outcome (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 1.10), primary recovery outcome (win ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.22), and the composite kidney outcome (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.50 to 1.07) were consistent across eGFR subgroups (P for interaction: 0.98, 0.67, and 0.44, respectively). The effects of dapagliflozin on AKI were also similar in participants with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 1.77) and ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.37 to 1.29). Dapagliflozin was well tolerated in participants with eGFR <60 and ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The effects of dapagliflozin on primary and secondary outcomes in hospitalized participants with COVID-19 were consistent in those with eGFR below/above 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Dapagliflozin was well tolerated and did not increase the risk of AKI in participants with eGFR below or above 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2."

      Our understanding of the normative concentrations of urine biomarkers in premature neonates is limited.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We evaluated urine from 750 extremely low gestational age (GA) neonates without severe acute kidney injury (AKI) to determine how GA affects ten different urine biomarkers at birth and over the first 30 postnatal days. Then, we investigated if the urine biomarkers changed over time at 27, 30, and 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Next, we evaluated the impact of sex on urine biomarker concentrations at birth and over time. Finally, we evaluated if urine biomarkers were impacted by treatment with erythropoietin (Epo).
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found that all ten biomarker concentrations differ at birth by GA and that some urine biomarker concentrations increase, while others decrease over time. At 27 weeks PMA, 7/10 urine biomarkers differed by GA. By 30 weeks PMA, 5/10 differed, and by 34 weeks PMA, only osteopontin differed by GA. About half of the biomarker concentrations differed by sex, and 4/10 showed different rates of change over time between males vs. females. We found no differences in urine biomarkers by treatment group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The temporal patterns, GA, and sex differences need to be considered in urine AKI biomarker analyses.
    


          Impact:
        
      
      Urine biomarker concentrations differ by GA at birth. Some urine biomarkers increase, while others decrease, over the first 30 postnatal days. Most urine biomarkers differ by GA at 27 weeks PMA, but are similar by 34 weeks PMA. Some urine biomarkers vary by sex in premature neonates. Urine biomarkers did not differ between neonates randomized to placebo vs. Epo."
Phase I dose-escalation study of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for poor surgical candidates with localized renal cell carcinoma.,"Lee Ponsky, Simon S Lo, Yuxia Zhang, Mark Schluchter, Yiying Liu, Ravi Patel, Robert Abouassaly, Scott Welford, Vikas Gulani, John Robert Haaga, Mitchell Machtay, Rodney J Ellis, Lee Ponskyet al.",2015 Oct,Radiother Oncol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26362723/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      To evaluate the tolerability of escalating doses of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary treatment of localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in poor surgical candidates.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Eligible patients included those with clinically staged radiographic and or pathologically confirmed RCC who had not undergone previous abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy. All patients had comorbid medical conditions which precluded surgery. Median (range) patient age was 77.6years (range 59-89) years and all patients had Karnofsky Performance Status of ⩾60. Median tumor volume was 57.9cm(3) (range 13.8-174.7cm(3)). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal/genitourinary toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (version 4). Tumor response was assessed by imaging results using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) measurement and percutaneous biopsy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 19 patients (13 men and 6 women) were treated on protocol from June 2006 through August 2011. Groups of 3-6 patients received 24, 32, 40, and 48Gy in 4 fractions. Median (range) follow-up was 13. 7months (5.9-34.7months). For possibly treatment-related acute toxicities, one patient developed grade 2 fatigue and one developed grade 4 duodenal ulcer. For possibly treatment-related late toxicities, 2 patients experienced grade 3 renal toxicity (worsening chronic kidney disease), one reported grade 2 urinary incontinence and one developed grade 4 duodenal ulcer. Among the 15 patients with evaluable response, 3 and 12 had partial response and stable disease, respectively, utilizing RECIST criteria. Among the 11 patients who had post-SBRT biopsy, only one (9%) was negative on first biopsy and an additional one (9%) turned negative without further therapy on second biopsy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dose escalation to 48Gy in 4 fractions has been achieved successfully without dose-limiting toxicities. A planned extension of this phase I trial is currently underway treating patients to 60Gy in 3 fractions to further evaluate this experimental therapy."
Hypocalcemia is associated with hypotension during CRRT: A secondary analysis of the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study.,"Yvelynne P Kelly, Shilpa Sharma, Suraj S Mothi, Finnian R McCausland, Mallika L Mendu, Gearoid M McMahon, Paul M Palevsky, Sushrut S Waikar, Yvelynne P Kellyet al.",2021 Oct:65:261-267.,J Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34274834/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      We investigated the effect of potentially modifiable continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)-related treatment factors on the risk of severe hypotension.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We carried out a secondary statistical analysis of the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network (ATN) trial. The primary exposures of interest were CRRT treatment dose, ultrafiltration rate, blood flow rate, ionized calcium level and type of anti-coagulation used. The primary outcome was severe hypotension, defined as vasopressor-inotropic score > 18 and calculated based on treatment doses of vasopressor and inotropic agents.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 1124 individuals enrolled in the ATN Trial, 786 were managed with CRRT. 265/786 (33.7%) patients experienced severe hypotension during the trial. A serum ionized calcium <1.02 mmol/l was associated with a higher risk of severe hypotension compared to a serum calcium >1.02 mmol/l (hazard ratio 2.9; 95% CI 1.5-5.7). There was no significant difference in the risk of hypotension associated with other CRRT treatment factors.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Of the CRRT treatment factors studied, hypocalcemia with a serum ionized calcium <1.02 mmol/l was associated with a significantly increased risk of treatment-associated hypotension. Further studies will be required to assess whether treatment targets for serum calcium improve the risk of hypotension during CRRT."
Prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGAN).,"David J Askenazi, Patrick J Heagerty, Robert H Schmicker, Russell Griffin, Patrick Brophy, Sandra E Juul, Dennis E Mayock, Stuart L Goldstein, Sangeeta Hingorani                              ;, PENUT Trial Consortium, David J Askenaziet al.",2020 Sep,Pediatr Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32488672/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      To determine the prevalence and severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) at different time frames in relation to gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW) in extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGAN). Our hypothesis is that ELGAN with lower GA and lower BW have higher AKI rates.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 923 ELGAN enrolled in the Preterm Erythropoietin Neuroprotection Trial were evaluated from birth until death or hospital discharge. AKI was defined according to kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) definition from clinically-derived serum creatinine (SCr) measurements. Severe AKI was defined as stage 2 or higher.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For the entire cohort, 351/923 (38.0%, CI = 34.8-41.3%) had at least one episode of stage 1 or higher AKI and 168/923 (18.2%, CI = 15.7-20.7%) had at least one episode of severe (stage 2 or higher) AKI. The prevalence of AKI stage 1 or higher for the entire cohort during the early (days 3-7), middle (days 8-14), and late follow-up period (after day 14) was 112/923 (12.1%, CI = 10.0-14.3%), 142/891 (15.9%, CI = 13.5-18.4%), and 249/875 (28.5%, CI = 25.4-31.5%), respectively. The rates of severe AKI during the hospital course were 27.8%, 21.9%, 13.6%, and 9.4% for the 24-, 25-, 26-, and 27-week GA groups, respectively. AKI rates were significantly higher with decreasing GA and decreasing BW for stated time trends (all p < 0.01 using tests for trend).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      AKI is relatively common in ELGAN during their initial hospital course and is associated with lower GA and BW."
Molecular Regulation of Acute Tie2 Suppression in Sepsis.,"Kristina Thamm, Claudia Schrimpf, Jennifer Retzlaff, Temitayo O Idowu, Matijs van Meurs, Jan G Zijlstra, Chandra C Ghosh, Jana Zeitvogel, Thomas A Werfel, Hermann Haller, Samir M Parikh, Sascha David, Kristina Thammet al.",2018 Sep,Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29979219/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Tie2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed by endothelial cells that maintains vascular barrier function. We recently reported that diverse critical illnesses acutely decrease Tie2 expression and that experimental Tie2 reduction suffices to recapitulate cardinal features of the septic vasculature. Here we investigated molecular mechanisms driving Tie2 suppression in settings of critical illness.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Laboratory and animal research, postmortem kidney biopsies from acute kidney injury patients and serum from septic shock patients.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Research laboratories and ICU of Hannover Medical School, Harvard Medical School, and University of Groningen.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Deceased septic acute kidney injury patients (n = 16) and controls (n = 12) and septic shock patients (n = 57) and controls (n = 22).
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Molecular biology assays (Western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction) + in vitro models of flow and transendothelial electrical resistance experiments in human umbilical vein endothelial cells; murine cecal ligation and puncture and lipopolysaccharide administration.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      We observed rapid reduction of both Tie2 messenger RNA and protein in mice following cecal ligation and puncture. In cultured endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α, suppression of Tie2 protein was more severe than Tie2 messenger RNA, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms. Evidence of protein-level regulation was found in tumor necrosis factor-α-treated endothelial cells, septic mice, and septic humans, all three of which displayed elevation of the soluble N-terminal fragment of Tie2. The matrix metalloprotease 14 was both necessary and sufficient for N-terminal Tie2 shedding. Since clinical settings of Tie2 suppression are often characterized by shock, we next investigated the effects of laminar flow on Tie2 expression. Compared with absence of flow, laminar flow induced both Tie2 messenger RNA and the expression of GATA binding protein 3. Conversely, septic lungs exhibited reduced GATA binding protein 3, and knockdown of GATA binding protein 3 in flow-exposed endothelial cells reduced Tie2 messenger RNA. Postmortem tissue from septic patients showed a trend toward reduced GATA binding protein 3 expression that was associated with Tie2 messenger RNA levels (p < 0.005).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Tie2 suppression is a pivotal event in sepsis that may be regulated both by matrix metalloprotease 14-driven Tie2 protein cleavage and GATA binding protein 3-driven flow regulation of Tie2 transcript."
Comparative Analysis of Prothrombin Complex Concentrate and Fresh Frozen Plasma in Coronary Surgery.,"Fausto Biancari, Vito G Ruggieri, Andrea Perrotti, Riccardo Gherli, Till Demal, Ilaria Franzese, Magnus Dalén, Giuseppe Santarpino, Antonino S Rubino, Daniele Maselli, Antonio Salsano, Francesco Nicolini, Matteo Saccocci, Giuseppe Gatti, Stefano Rosato, Paola D'Errigo, Eeva-Maija Kinnunen, Marisa De Feo, Tuomas Tauriainen, Francesco Onorati, Giovanni Mariscalco, Fausto Biancariet al.",2019 Dec,Heart Lung Circ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30709591/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Recent studies suggested that prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) might be more effective than fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reduce red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirement after cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a comparative analysis of 416 patients who received FFP postoperatively and 119 patients who received PCC with or without FFP after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mixed-effects regression analyses adjusted for multiple covariates and participating centres showed that PCC significantly decreased RBC transfusion (67.2% vs. 87.5%, adjusted OR 0.319, 95%CI 0.136-0.752) and platelet transfusion requirements (11.8% vs. 45.2%, adjusted OR 0.238, 95%CI 0.097-0.566) compared with FFP. The PCC cohort received a mean of 2.7±3.7 (median, 2.0, IQR 4) units of RBC and the FFP cohort received a mean of 4.9±6.3 (median, 3.0, IQR 4) units of RBC (adjusted coefficient, -1.926, 95%CI -3.357-0.494). The use of PCC increased the risk of KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) acute kidney injury (41.4% vs. 28.2%, adjusted OR 2.300, 1.203-4.400), but not of KDIGO acute kidney injury stage 3 (6.0% vs. 8.0%, OR 0.850, 95%CI 0.258-2.796) when compared with the FFP cohort.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results suggest that the use of PCC compared with FFP may reduce the need of blood transfusion after CABG."
Complement Modulation of Anti-Aging Factor Klotho in Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury and Delayed Graft Function.,"G Castellano, A Intini, A Stasi, C Divella, M Gigante, P Pontrelli, R Franzin, M Accetturo, A Zito, M Fiorentino, V Montinaro, G Lucarelli, P Ditonno, M Battaglia, A Crovace, F Staffieri, B Oortwijn, E van Amersfoort, G Pertosa, G Grandaliano, L Gesualdo, G Castellanoet al.",2016 Jan,Am J Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26280899/,"basic (laboratory) research/science, complement biology, immunobiology, ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), kidney transplantation/nephrology.","Klotho is an anti-aging factor mainly produced by renal tubular epithelial cells (TEC) with pleiotropic functions. Klotho is down-regulated in acute kidney injury in native kidney; however, the modulation of Klotho in kidney transplantation has not been investigated. In a swine model of ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), we observed a remarkable reduction of renal Klotho by 24 h from IRI. Complement inhibition by C1-inhibitor preserved Klotho expression in vivo by abrogating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling. In accordance, complement anaphylotoxin C5a led to a significant down-regulation of Klotho in TEC in vitro that was NF-kB mediated. Analysis of Klotho in kidneys from cadaveric donors demonstrated a significant expression of Klotho in pre-implantation biopsies; however, patients affected by delayed graft function (DGF) showed a profound down-regulation of Klotho compared with patients with early graft function. Quantification of serum Klotho after 2 years from transplantation demonstrated significant lower levels in DGF patients. Our data demonstrated that complement might be pivotal in the down-regulation of Klotho in IRI leading to a permanent deficiency after years from transplantation. Considering the anti-senescence and anti-fibrotic effects of Klotho at renal levels, we hypothesize that this acquired deficiency of Klotho might contribute to DGF-associated chronic allograft dysfunction."
Remote ischaemic preconditioning versus sham procedure for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: an external feasibility randomized controlled trial.,"Ronelle Mouton, Jon Pollock, Jasmeet Soar, David C Mitchell, Chris A Rogers, Ronelle Moutonet al.",2015 Aug 25:16:377.,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26303818/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Despite advances in perioperative care, elective abdominal aorta aneurysm (AAA) repair carries significant morbidity and mortality. Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIC) is a physiological phenomenon whereby a brief episode of ischaemia-reperfusion protects against a subsequent longer ischaemic insult. Trials in cardiovascular surgery have shown that RIC can protect patients' organs during surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate whether RIC could be successfully introduced in elective AAA repair and to obtain the information needed to design a multi-centre RCT.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Consecutive patients presenting for elective AAA repair, using an endovascular (EVAR) or open procedure, in a single large city hospital in the UK were assessed for trial eligibility. Patients who consented to participate were randomized to receive RIC (three cycles of 5 min ischaemia followed by 5 min reperfusion in the upper arm immediately before surgery) or a sham procedure. Patients were followed up for 6 months. We assessed eligibility and consent rates, the logistics of RIC implementation, randomization, blinding, data capture, patient and staff opinion, and variability and frequency of clinical outcome measures.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Between January 2010 and December 2012, 98 patients were referred for AAA repair, 93 were screened, 85 (91%) were eligible, 70 were approached for participation and 69 consented to participate; 34 were randomized to RIC and 35 to the sham procedure. There was a greater than expected variation in the complexity of EVAR that impacted the outcomes. Acute kidney injury occurred in 28 (AKIN 1: 23%; AKIN 2: 15% and AKIN 3: 3%) and 7 (10%) had a perioperative myocardial infarction. Blinding was successful, and interviews with participants and staff indicated that the procedure was acceptable. There were no adverse events secondary to the intervention in the 6 months following the intervention.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study provided essential information for the planning and design of a multi-centre RCT to assess effectiveness of RIC for improving clinical outcomes in elective AAA repair. Patient consent was high, and the RIC intervention was carried out with minimal disruption to clinical care. The allocation scheme for a definite trial should take into account both the surgical procedure and its complexity to avoid confounding the effect of the RIC, as was observed in this study.

Propofol-based anaesthesia versus sevoflurane-based anaesthesia for living donor kidney transplantation: results of the VAPOR-1 randomized controlled trial.,"G J Nieuwenhuijs-Moeke, V B Nieuwenhuijs, M A J Seelen, S P Berger, M C van den Heuvel, J G M Burgerhof, P J Ottens, R J Ploeg, H G D Leuvenink, M M R F Struys, G J Nieuwenhuijs-Moekeet al.",2017 May 1,Br J Anaesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28510740/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Kidney transplantation is associated with harmful processes affecting the viability of the graft. One of these processes is associated with the phenomenon of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Anaesthetic conditioning is a widely described strategy to attenuate ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We therefore conducted the Volatile Anaesthetic Protection of Renal Transplants-1 trial, a pilot project evaluating the influence of two anaesthetic regimens, propofol- vs sevoflurane-based anaesthesia, on biochemical and clinical outcomes in living donor kidney transplantation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixty couples were randomly assigned to the following three groups: PROP (donor and recipient propofol), SEVO (donor and recipient sevoflurane), and PROSE (donor propofol and recipient sevoflurane). The primary outcome was renal injury reflected by urinary biomarkers. The follow-up period was 2 yr.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Three couples were excluded, leaving 57 couples for analysis. Concentrations of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), N -acetyl-β- d -glucosaminidase (NAG), and heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) in the first urine upon reperfusion showed no differences. On day 2, KIM-1 concentrations were higher in SEVO [952.8 (interquartile range 311.8-1893.0) pg mmol -1 ] compared with PROP [301.2 (202.0-504.7) pg mmol -1 ]. This was the same for NAG: SEVO, 1.835 (1.162-2.457) IU mmol -1 vs PROP, 1.078 (0.819-1.713) IU mmol -1 . Concentrations of H-FABP showed no differences. Measured glomerular filtration rate at 3, 6, and 12 months showed no difference. After 2 yr, there was a difference in the acute rejection rate ( P =0.039). Post hoc testing revealed a difference between PROP (35%) and PROSE (5%; P =0.020). The difference between PROP and SEVO (11%) was not significant ( P =0.110).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The SEVO group showed higher urinary KIM-1 and NAG concentrations in living donor kidney transplantation on the second day after transplantation. This was not reflected in inferior graft outcome.

Surgical versus percutaneous coronary revascularization for multivessel disease in diabetic patients with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome: analysis from the Acute Catheterization and Early Intervention Triage Strategy trial.,"Yanai Ben-Gal, Rephael Mohr, Frederick Feit, E Magnus Ohman, Ajay Kirtane, Ke Xu, Roxana Mehran, Gregg W Stone, Yanai Ben-Galet al.",2015 Jun,Circ Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26019142/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The preferred revascularization strategy for diabetic patients with acute coronary syndromes and multivessel coronary artery disease is uncertain. We evaluated the outcomes of diabetic patients with moderate and high-risk acute coronary syndrome and multivessel disease managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Among 13 819 moderate and high-risk acute coronary syndrome patients enrolled in the Acute Catheterization and Early Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trial, 1772 diabetic patients had multivessel disease with left anterior descending artery involvement and were managed by PCI (n=1349) or CABG (n=423). Propensity scoring was applied to adjust for differences in baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics, yielding a total of 326 matched patients (163 managed by PCI and 163 managed by CABG). At 30 days, treatment with PCI compared with CABG was associated with lower rates of major bleeding (15.3% versus 55.6%; P<0.0001), blood transfusions (9.2% versus 43.2%; P<0.0001), and acute kidney injury (13.4% versus 33.6%; P<0.0001), but more unplanned revascularization procedures (6.9% versus 1.9%; P=0.03). At 1 year PCI was associated with higher rates of repeat revascularization procedures (19.5% versus 5.2%; P=0.0001), with nonsignificantly different rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death at either 30 days or 1 year.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In the large-scale ACUITY trial, diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome and multivessel disease treated with PCI rather than CABG had less bleeding and acute kidney injury, greater need for repeat revascularization procedures, and comparable rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death through 1-year follow-up.

Prospective Randomized Comparison of Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Optical Coherence Tomography to Guide Revascularization of Intermediate Coronary Stenoses: One-Month Results.,"Antonio Maria Leone, Francesco Burzotta, Cristina Aurigemma, Giovanni Luigi De Maria, Aniello Zambrano, Giuseppe Zimbardo, Manfredi Arioti, Emma Cerracchio, Rocco Vergallo, Carlo Trani, Filippo Crea, Antonio Maria Leoneet al.",2019 Aug 6,J Am Heart Assoc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31331219/,"fractional flow reserve, optical coherence tomography, personalized medicine.","Background Fractional flow reserve (FFR) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) may help both in assessment and in percutaneous coronary intervention optimization of angiographically intermediate coronary lesions. We designed a prospective trial comparing the clinical and economic outcomes associated with FFR or OCT in angiographically intermediate coronary lesions. Methods and Results Three hundred fifty patients with angiographically intermediate coronary lesions (n=446) were randomized to FFR or OCT guidance. In the FFR arm, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed if FFR was ≤0.80 aiming for a postprocedure FFR >0.90. In the OCT arm, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed if percentage of area stenosis was ≥75% or 50% to 75% with minimal lumen area <2.5 mm2 or plaque ulceration. Costs, angina frequency, and major adverse cardiac events were assessed at 1 month and at 13 months. We present early data at 1 month consistent with a prespecified analysis of secondary end points. Patients randomized to FFR, as compared with OCT, were significantly more commonly managed with medical therapy alone (67.7% versus 41.1%; P<0.001), required less contrast media (245±137 versus 280±129 mL; P=0.004), and exhibited a lower occurrence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (1.7% versus 8.6%; P=0.034). At 1 month, in comparison to FFR, OCT was associated with increased total costs (2831±1288 versus 4292±3844 euros/patient; P<0.001) whereas occurrence of major adverse cardiac events or significant angina was similar. Conclusions In patients with angiographically intermediate coronary lesions, a functional guidance by FFR, as compared with OCT, increased the rate of patients treated with medical therapy alone. This translated into a significant reduction in administered contrast, contrast-induced acute kidney injury, and total costs at 1 month with FFR.

The combined effects of exercise-induced muscle damage and heat stress on acute kidney stress and heat strain during subsequent endurance exercise.,"Zidong Li, Zachary McKenna, Zachary Fennel, Roberto Carlos Nava, Andrew Wells, Jeremy Ducharme, Jonathan Houck, Kylie Morana, Christine Mermier, Matthew Kuennen, Flavio de Castro Magalhaes, Fabiano Amorim, Zidong Liet al.",2022 May,Eur J Appl Physiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35237867/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of the study was to investigate the combined effect of downhill running and heat stress on muscle damage, as well as on heat strain and kidney stress during subsequent running in the heat.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a randomized cross-over study, ten non-heat-acclimated, physically active males completed downhill running in temperate (EIMD in Temp) and hot (EIMD in Hot) conditions followed by an exercise-heat stress (HS) test after 3-h seated rest. Blood and urine samples were collected immediately pre- and post-EIMD and HS, and 24 h post-EIMD (post-24 h). Core temperature and thermal sensation were measured to evaluate heat strain. Serum creatine kinase (CK), maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the quadriceps (MVC) and perceived muscle soreness were measured to evaluate muscle damage. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels were measured to indicate acute kidney stress.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CK, MVC and perceived soreness were not different between conditions at any timepoints. In the EIMD in Hot condition, urinary NGAL was significantly elevated from pre- to post-HS (pre-HS: 6.56 {1.53-12.24} ng/min, post-HS: 13.72 {7.67-21.46} ng/min, p = 0.034). Such elevation of NGAL or KIM-1 was not found in the EIMD in Temp condition.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      As compared with downhill running in a temperate environment, downhill running in a hot environment does not appear to aggravate muscle damage. However, elevated NGAL levels following EIMD in a hot environment suggest such exercise may increase risk of mild acute kidney injury during subsequent endurance exercise in the heat."
Urinary biomarkers after donor nephrectomy.,"Judith M Hoogendijk-van den Akker, Michiel C Warlé, Arjan D van Zuilen, Heinrich J Kloke, Kim E Wever, Frank C H d'Ancona, Denise M D Ӧzdemir, Jack F M Wetzels, Andries J Hoitsma, Judith M Hoogendijk-van den Akkeret al.",2015 May,Transpl Int,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25581388/,"acute kidney injury, donor nephrectomy, urinary biomarkers.","As the beginning of living-donor kidney transplantation, physicians have expressed concern about the possibility that unilateral nephrectomy can be harmful to a healthy individual. To investigate whether the elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy causes early damage to the remaining kidney, we evaluated urine biomarkers after laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. We measured albumin and alpha-1-microglobulin (α-1-MGB) in urine samples collected during and after open and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy and colectomy. Additionally, kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured in urine samples collected during and after laparoscopic donor nephrectomy and colectomy. The same biomarkers were studied in patients randomly assigned to standard or low IAP during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. We observed a peak in urinary albumin excretion during all procedures. Urine α-1-MGB rose in the postoperative period with a peak on the third postoperative day after donor nephrectomy. Urine α-1-MGB did not increase after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and colectomy. After laparoscopic nephrectomy, we observed slight increases in urine KIM-1 during surgery and in urine NGAL at day 2-3 after the procedure. After laparoscopic colectomy, both KIM-1 and NGAL were increased in the postoperative period. There were no differences between the high- and low-pressure procedure. Elevated urinary α-1-MGB suggests kidney damage after donor nephrectomy, occurring irrespective of IAP during the laparoscopic procedure."
Plasma cytokine levels in spinal surgery with sevoflurane or total intravenous propofol anesthesia - A post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial.,"Stephanie Franzén, Egidijus Semenas, Anders Larsson, Michael Hultström, Robert Frithiof, Stephanie Franzénet al.",2023 Sep:169:156290.,Cytokine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37399604/,"Acute kidney injury, Interleukin-6, Propofol, Sevoflurane, Surgery.","Surgical tissue trauma stimulates an inflammatory response resulting in increased levels of cytokines which could contribute to acute kidney injury (AKI). It is not clear if anesthetic modality affects this response. We aimed to investigate the role of anesthesia in a healthy surgical population on the inflammatory response and the correlation to plasma creatinine. This study is a post hoc analysis of a published randomized clinical trial. We analyzed plasma from patients who underwent elective spinal surgery randomized to either total intravenous propofol anesthesia (n = 12) or sevoflurane anesthesia (n = 10). The plasma samples were collected before anesthesia, during anesthesia, and 1 h after surgery. Plasma cytokine levels after surgery were analyzed for correlations with duration of surgical insult and change in plasma creatinine concentration. The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) was increased after surgery compared with preoperatively. IL-6 was higher in the sevoflurane group than the propofol group after surgery. No patient developed AKI, but plasma creatinine was increased postoperatively in the sevoflurane group. There was a significant association between surgical time and plasma IL-6 postoperatively. No significant correlation between change in plasma creatinine and IL-6 was detected. The cytokines IL-4, IL-13, Eotaxin, Interferon γ-Induced Protein 10 (IP-10), Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1β (MIP-1β), and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1 (MCP-1) were lower postoperatively than before surgery independent of anesthetic modality. This post hoc analysis revealed that plasma IL-6 was increased after surgery and more so in the sevoflurane group than the propofol group. Postoperative plasma IL-6 concentration was associated with surgical time."

      The most appropriate targets for systolic blood pressure to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among persons without diabetes remain uncertain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We randomly assigned 9361 persons with a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes, to a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At 1 year, the mean systolic blood pressure was 121.4 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 136.2 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group. The intervention was stopped early after a median follow-up of 3.26 years owing to a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (1.65% per year vs. 2.19% per year; hazard ratio with intensive treatment, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P<0.001). All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the intensive-treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.90; P=0.003). Rates of serious adverse events of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure, but not of injurious falls, were higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause, although significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.

          Primary and secondary outcome measures:
        
      
      The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects alive and free of respiratory failure and/or the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Numerous secondary and exploratory endpoints were assessed including ventilation-free days, and changes in kidney function or serum biomarkers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At 28 days, 27 (90.3%) and 28 (93.3%) of subjects in the placebo and LSALT groups were free of respiratory failure and the need for RRT (p=0.86). On days 14 and 28, the number of patients still requiring more intensive respiratory support (O2 ≥6 L/minute, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) was 6 (19.4%) and 3 (9.7%) in the placebo group versus 2 (6.7%) and 2 (6.7%) in the LSALT group, respectively (p=0.14; p=0.67). Unadjusted analysis of ventilation-free days demonstrated 22.8 days for the LSALT group compared with 20.9 in the placebo group (p=0.4). LSALT-treated subjects had a significant reduction in the fold expression from baseline to end of treatment of serum CXCL10 compared with placebo (p=0.02). Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between groups.
    


          Conclusion:

      To determine the efficacy and adverse effects of cerebral embolic protection devices in reducing ischemic central nervous system (CNS) injury during SAVR.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      A randomized clinical trial of patients with calcific aortic stenosis undergoing SAVR at 18 North American centers between March 2015 and July 2016. The end of follow-up was December 2016.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Use of 1 of 2 cerebral embolic protection devices (n = 118 for suction-based extraction and n = 133 for intra-aortic filtration device) vs a standard aortic cannula (control; n = 132) at the time of SAVR.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary end point was freedom from clinical or radiographic CNS infarction at 7 days (± 3 days) after the procedure. Secondary end points included a composite of mortality, clinical ischemic stroke, and acute kidney injury within 30 days after surgery; delirium; mortality; serious adverse events; and neurocognition.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 383 randomized patients (mean age, 73.9 years; 38.4% women; 368 [96.1%] completed the trial), the rate of freedom from CNS infarction at 7 days was 32.0% with suction-based extraction vs 33.3% with control (between-group difference, -1.3%; 95% CI, -13.8% to 11.2%) and 25.6% with intra-aortic filtration vs 32.4% with control (between-group difference, -6.9%; 95% CI, -17.9% to 4.2%). The 30-day composite end point was not significantly different between suction-based extraction and control (21.4% vs 24.2%, respectively; between-group difference, -2.8% [95% CI, -13.5% to 7.9%]) nor between intra-aortic filtration and control (33.3% vs 23.7%; between-group difference, 9.7% [95% CI, -1.2% to 20.5%]). There were no significant differences in mortality (3.4% for suction-based extraction vs 1.7% for control; and 2.3% for intra-aortic filtration vs 1.5% for control) or clinical stroke (5.1% for suction-based extraction vs 5.8% for control; and 8.3% for intra-aortic filtration vs 6.1% for control). Delirium at postoperative day 7 was 6.3% for suction-based extraction vs 15.3% for control (between-group difference, -9.1%; 95% CI, -17.1% to -1.0%) and 8.1% for intra-aortic filtration vs 15.6% for control (between-group difference, -7.4%; 95% CI, -15.5% to 0.6%). Mortality and overall serious adverse events at 90 days were not significantly different across groups. Patients in the intra-aortic filtration group vs patients in the control group experienced significantly more acute kidney injury events (14 vs 4, respectively; P = .02) and cardiac arrhythmias (57 vs 30; P = .004).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients undergoing SAVR, cerebral embolic protection devices compared with a standard aortic cannula did not significantly reduce the risk of CNS infarction at 7 days. Potential benefits for reduction in delirium, cognition, and symptomatic stroke merit larger trials with longer follow-up.

      The optimal strategy for initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with severe acute kidney injury in the context of septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is unknown.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To examine the effect of an early compared with a delayed RRT initiation strategy on 60-day mortality according to baseline sepsis status, ARDS status, and severity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Post hoc analysis of the AKIKI (Artificial Kidney Initiation in Kidney Injury) trial.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Subgroups were defined according to baseline characteristics: sepsis status (Sepsis-3 definition), ARDS status (Berlin definition), Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3), and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). Of 619 patients, 348 (56%) had septic shock and 207 (33%) had ARDS. We found no significant influence of the baseline sepsis status (P = 0.28), baseline ARDS status (P = 0.94), and baseline severity scores (P = 0.77 and P = 0.46 for SAPS 3 and SOFA, respectively) on the comparison of 60-day mortality according to RRT initiation strategy. A delayed RRT initiation strategy allowed 45% of patients with septic shock and 46% of patients with ARDS to escape RRT. Urine output was higher in the delayed group. Renal function recovery occurred earlier with the delayed RRT strategy in patients with septic shock or ARDS (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). Time to successful extubation in patients with ARDS was not affected by RRT strategy (P = 0.43).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Early RRT initiation strategy was not associated with any improvement of 60-day mortality in patients with severe acute kidney injury and septic shock or ARDS. Unnecessary and potentially risky procedures might often be avoided in these fragile populations. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01932190)."

          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This intention-to-treat feasibility trial randomized patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing early revascularization and with N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration more than 300 pg/mL to RIM or SC across 3 hospitals in Singapore from July 8, 2015, to March 29, 2019. RIM participants underwent 6 months of remote consultations that included β-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACE-I/ARB) dose adjustment by a centralized nurse practitioner team while SC participants were treated face-to-face by their cardiologists.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary safety end point was a composite of hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, or acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization. To assess the efficacy of RIM in dose adjustment of β-blockers and ACE-I/ARBs compared with SC, dose intensity scores were derived by converting comparable doses of different β-blockers and ACE-I/ARBs to a scale from 0 to 5. The primary efficacy end point was the 6-month indexed left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) adjusted for baseline LVESV.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 301 participants, 149 (49.5%) were randomized to RIM and 152 (50.5%) to SC. RIM and SC participants had similar mean (SD) age (55.3 [8.5] vs 54.7 [9.1] years), median (interquartile range) N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (807 [524-1360] vs 819 [485-1320] pg/mL), mean (SD) baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (57.4% [11.1%] vs 58.1% [10.3%]), and mean (SD) indexed LVESV (32.4 [14.1] vs 30.6 [11.7] mL/m2); 15 patients [5.9%] had a left ventricular ejection fraction <40%. The primary safety end point occurred in 0 RIM vs 2 SC participants (1.4%) (P = .50). The mean β-blocker and ACE-I/ARB dose intensity score at 6 months was 3.03 vs 2.91 (adjusted mean difference, 0.12 [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.26; P = .10]) and 2.96 vs 2.77 (adjusted mean difference, 0.19 [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.40; P = .07]), respectively. The 6-month indexed LVESV was 28.9 vs 29.7 mL/m2 (adjusted mean difference, -0.80 mL/m2 [95% CI, -3.20 to 1.60; P = .51]).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among low-risk patients with revascularization after myocardial infarction, RIM by allied health care professionals was feasible and safe. There were no differences in achieved medication doses or indices of left ventricular remodeling. Further studies of RIM in higher-risk cohorts are warranted.

Spironolactone reduces oxidative stress in living donor kidney transplantation: a randomized controlled trial.,"Luis Eduardo Morales-Buenrostro, Juan Antonio Ortega-Trejo, Rosalba Pérez-Villalva, Lluvia A Marino, Yvett González-Bobadilla, Hilda Juárez, Flor M Zamora-Mejía, Norma González, Ramón Espinoza, Jonatan Barrera-Chimal, Norma A Bobadilla, Luis Eduardo Morales-Buenrostroet al.",2019 Sep 1,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31241992/,"kidney transplantation, mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, postischemic injury.","Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism prevents acute kidney injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion in rodent and pig preclinical models. In a pilot study, we showed that spironolactone (25 mg) reduced oxidative stress after 5 days of kidney transplant (KT). In the present study, we investigated the effects of higher doses (50 and 100 mg) of spironolactone on kidney function, tubular injury markers, and oxidative stress in living donor KT recipients. We included KT recipients aged 18 yr or older who received immunosuppression therapy with IL-2 receptor antagonist, mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, and tacrolimus with negative cross-match, and compatible blood group. Patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 27), spironolactone (50 mg, n = 25), or spironolactone (100 mg, n = 25). Treatment was given from 3 days before and up to 5 days after KT. Serum creatinine, K+, urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin-2, heat shock protein 72, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine levels were assessed. As expected, kidney function was improved after KT. Serum K+ remained in the normal range along the study. There was no significant effect of spironolactone on urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin-2 levels, whereas the increase in urinary heat shock protein 72 levels tended to be less intense in the 100 mg spironolactone-treated group (P = 0.054). In the placebo-treated group, urinary 8-hydroxylated-guanosine levels increased on days 3 and 5 after transplantation. This effect was prevented in patients that received spironolactone. In conclusion, spironolactone reduces the acute increase in urinary oxidative stress in living donor KT recipients."
Complications After Self-expanding Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.,"John V Conte, James Hermiller Jr, Jon R Resar, G Michael Deeb, Thomas G Gleason, David H Adams, Jeffrey J Popma, Steven J Yakubov, Daniel Watson, Jia Guo, George L Zorn rd, Michael J Reardon, John V Conteet al.",2017,Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29195573/,"SAVR, TAVR, acute kidney injury, bleeding, complications.","Procedural complications following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are usually reported as retrospective analyses. We report the first comparison of complications following SAVR or self-expanding TAVR from a prospectively randomized study of high-risk SAVR patients. Three hundred ninety-five TAVR and 402 SAVR patients were prospectively enrolled and randomized 1:1 to TAVR with a CoreValve bioprosthesis or a surgical bioprosthetic valve. The rates of major procedural and vascular complications occurring (periprocedurally (0-3 days) and early (4-30 days)) were compared for TAVR vs SAVR patients. All-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, and major infection were similar in both periods post procedure. Within 0-3 days, the major vascular complication rate was significantly higher with TAVR (P = 0.003). Life-threatening or disabling bleeding (P < 0.001), encephalopathy (P = 0.02), atrial fibrillation (P < 0.001), and acute kidney injury (P < 0.001) were significantly higher with SAVR. Non-iliofemoral TAVR approaches had a higher incidence of major or life-threatening or disabling bleeding at 0-3days (P < 0.05). Procedural complications unique to TAVR included coronary occlusion 0.5% (2) and TAVR pop outs 2.8% (11) with no valve embolizations. Pop outs were similar between iliofemoral 2.8% (9/324) and non-iliofemoral approaches 3.0% (2/66). Procedural complications unique to SAVR included aortic dissection 0.8% (3/357) and injury to other heart structures 2.0% (7/357). The procedural complication profiles of TAVR and SAVR are unique. Intraoperative deaths were seen in TAVR only. Mortality at 3 and 30 days was similar. The higher incidence of some complications likely reflects the greater invasiveness of SAVR in this aged high-risk population."
High Stroke Volume Variation Method by Mannitol Administration Can Decrease Blood Loss During Donor Hepatectomy.,"Hyungseok Seo, In-Gu Jun, Tae-Yong Ha, Shin Hwang, Sung-Gyu Lee, Young-Kug Kim, Hyungseok Seoet al.",2016 Jan,Medicine (Baltimore),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26765409/,No keywords found,"Optimal fluid management to reduce blood loss during donor hepatectomy is important for maximizing donor safety. Mannitol can induce osmotic diuresis, helping prevent increased intravascular volume status. We therefore evaluated the effect of high stroke volume variation (SVV) method by mannitol administration and fluid restriction on blood loss during donor hepatectomy.In this prospective study, 64 donors scheduled for donor right hepatectomy were included and allocated into 2 groups. In group A, the SVV value of each patient was maintained at 10% to 20% during hepatic resection with 0.5 g/kg mannitol administration and fluid restriction at a rate of 2 to 4 mL/kg/h. In group B, the SVV value was maintained at <10% by fluid administration at a rate of 6 to 10 mL/kg/h without diuretic administration during surgery. Intraoperative blood loss was estimated by the loss of red cell mass. Surgeon satisfaction scores and postoperative outcomes, including acute kidney injury, abnormal chest radiographic findings, and hospital stay duration, were also assessed.SVV during hepatectomy was significantly higher in group A than in group B (11.0 ± 1.7 vs 6.5 ± 1.1, P < 0.001). The red cell mass loss was significantly lower in group A than in group B (145.4 ± 107.6 vs 307.9 ± 110.7 mL, P < 0.001). Surgeon satisfaction scores were higher in group A than in group B (2.8 ± 0.5 vs 2.0 ± 0.6, P < 0.001). The incidence of acute kidney injury, abnormal chest radiographic findings, and duration of hospital stay did not significantly differ between the 2 groups.Maintenance of high SVV by mannitol administration is effective and safe for reducing blood loss during donor hepatectomy."
Circulating endothelial cells transiently increase in peripheral blood after kidney transplantation.,"H Tejeda-Mora, J G H P Verhoeven, W Verschoor, K Boer, D A Hesselink, M W F van den Hoogen, L J W van der Laan, C C Baan, R C Minnee, M J Hoogduijn, H Tejeda-Moraet al.",2021 Apr 26,Sci Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33903694/,No keywords found,"The diagnosis of kidney allograft rejection is based on late histological and clinical markers. Early, specific and minimally-invasive biomarkers may improve rejection diagnosis. Endothelial cells (EC) are one of the earliest targets in kidney transplant rejection. We investigated whether circulating EC (cEC) could serve as an earlier and less invasive biomarker for allograft rejection. Blood was collected from a cohort of 51 kidney transplant recipients before and at multiple timepoints after transplantation, including during a for cause biopsy. The number and phenotype of EC was assessed by flow-cytometric analysis. Unbiased selection of EC was done using principal component (PCA) analysis. Paired analysis revealed a transient cEC increase of 2.1-fold on the third day post-transplant, recovering to preoperative levels at seventh day post-transplant and onwards. Analysis of HLA subtype demonstrated that cEC mainly originate from the recipient. cEC levels were not associated with allograft rejection, allograft function or other allograft pathologies. However, cEC in patients with allograft rejection and increased levels of cEC showed elevated levels of KIM-1 (kidney injury marker-1). These findings indicate that cEC numbers and phenotype are affected after kidney transplantation but may not improve rejection diagnosis."
Effect of using hypotension prediction index versus conventional goal-directed haemodynamic management to reduce intraoperative hypotension in non-cardiac surgery: A randomised controlled trial.,"Yusuke Yoshikawa, Makishi Maeda, Tatsuya Kunigo, Tomoe Sato, Kanako Takahashi, Sho Ohno, Tomoki Hirahata, Michiaki Yamakage, Yusuke Yoshikawaet al.",2024 May:93:111348.,J Clin Anesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38039629/,No keywords found,"Study objective:
        
      
      It remains unclear whether it is the hypotension prediction index itself or goal-directed haemodynamic therapy that mitigates intraoperative hypotension.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A single centre randomised controlled trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Sapporo Medical University Hospital.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      A total of 64 adults patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were randomly assigned to either group receiving conventional goal-directed therapy (FloTrac group) or combination of the hypotension prediction index and conventional goal-directed therapy (HPI group). To investigate the independent utility of the index, the peak rates of arterial pressure and dynamic arterial elastance were not included in the treatment algorithm for the HPI group.
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      The primary outcome was the time-weighted average of the areas under the threshold. Secondary outcomes were area under the threshold, the number of hypotension events, total duration of hypotension events, mean mean arterial pressure during the hypotension period, number of hypotension events with mean arterial pressure < 50 mmHg, amounts of fluids, blood products, blood loss, and urine output, frequency and amount of vasoactive agents, concentration of haemoglobin during the monitoring period, and 30-day mortality.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      The time-weighted average of the area below the threshold was lower in the HPI group than in the control group; 0.19 mmHg (interquartile range, 0.06-0.80 mmHg) vs. 0.66 mmHg (0.28-1.67 mmHg), with a median difference of -0.41 mmHg (95% confidence interval, -0.69 to -0.10 mmHg), p = 0.005. Norepinephrine was administered to 12 (40%) and 5 (17%) patients in the HPI and FloTrac groups, respectively (p = 0.045). No significant differences were observed in the volumes of fluid and blood products between the study groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The current randomised controlled trial results suggest that using the hypotension prediction index independently lowered the cumulative amount of intraoperative hypotension during major non-cardiac surgery."
"Phase II trial demonstrates the efficacy and safety of individualized, dosimetry-based 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment of NET patients.","Anna Sundlöv, Katarina Sjögreen Gleisner, Jan Tennvall, Michael Ljungberg, Carl Fredrik Warfvinge, Kajsa Holgersson, Andreas Hallqvist, Peter Bernhardt, Johanna Svensson, Anna Sundlövet al.",2022 Sep,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35451612/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Radionuclide therapy with 177Lu-DOTATATE is well established for patients with advanced somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors with a standard schedule of 7.4 GBq at four occasions. However, this approach does not consider individual variability affecting the tumor radiation dose or dose to organs at risk. Therefore, it is important to assess more personalized strategies. The aim of this phase II trial was to evaluate individualized 177Lu-DOTATATE for which the number of cycles varied based on renal dosimetry.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients were eligible if they had a progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumor with a Ki 67 labeling index < 20%. They received cycles of 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-DOTATATE at 10 ± 2-week intervals until a predefined radiation dose to the kidneys was reached. The primary endpoint was objective tumor response (RECIST v 1.1). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity (CTCAE v. 4.0).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ninety-six patients who had received a median of 5 cycles (range 1-9) were evaluable for efficacy. The objective tumor response was 16% partial response, 66% stable disease, and 19% progressive disease. The median PFS and OS were 29 months and 47 months, respectively, and were significantly associated with kidney dose, performance status, and Ki 67 levels but not with tumor origin. The overall toxicity was mild, and the most common events were grade 1-2 anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. Grade 3-4 toxicity occurred in < 10% of patients and was mostly hematological, with no grade 3-4 renal toxicity.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Individualized treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE based on renal dosimetry is clearly feasible with low toxicity and promising efficacy, showing the potential to further improve outcome beyond the standard approach, and should be further assessed in randomized trials.

Bivalirudin Versus Heparin Anticoagulation in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: The Randomized BRAVO-3 Trial.,"George D Dangas, Thierry Lefèvre, Christian Kupatt, Didier Tchetche, Ulrich Schäfer, Nicolas Dumonteil, John G Webb, Antonio Colombo, Stephan Windecker, Jurriën M Ten Berg, David Hildick-Smith, Roxana Mehran, Peter Boekstegers, Axel Linke, Christophe Tron, Eric Van Belle, Anita W Asgar, Andreas Fach, Raban Jeger, Gennaro Sardella, Hans Ulrich Hink, Oliver Husser, Eberhard Grube, Efthymios N Deliargyris, Ilknur Lechthaler, Debra Bernstein, Peter Wijngaard, Prodromos Anthopoulos, Christian Hengstenberg                              ;, BRAVO- Investigators, George D Dangaset al.",2015 Dec 29,J Am Coll Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26477635/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Anticoagulation is required during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. Although an optimal regimen has not been determined, heparin is mainly used. Direct thrombin inhibition with bivalirudin may be an effective alternative to heparin as the procedural anticoagulant agent in this setting.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The goal of this study was to determine whether bivalirudin offers an alternative to heparin as the procedural anticoagulant agent in patients undergoing TAVR.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 802 patients with aortic stenosis were randomized to undergo transfemoral TAVR with bivalirudin versus unfractionated heparin during the procedure. The 2 primary endpoints were major bleeding within 48 h or before hospital discharge (whichever occurred first) and 30-day net adverse clinical events, defined as the combination of major adverse cardiovascular events (all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and major bleeding.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Anticoagulation with bivalirudin versus heparin did not meet superiority because it did not result in significantly lower rates of major bleeding at 48 h (6.9% vs. 9.0%; relative risk: 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48 to 1.23; p = 0.27) or net adverse cardiovascular events at 30 days (14.4% vs. 16.1%; relative risk: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.24; risk difference: -1.72; 95% CI: -6.70 to 3.25; p = 0.50); regarding the latter, the prespecified noninferiority hypothesis was met (pnoninferiority < 0.01). Rates of major adverse cardiovascular events at 48 h were not significantly different (3.5% vs. 4.8%; relative risk: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.37 to 1.43; p = 0.35). At 48 h, the bivalirudin group had significantly fewer myocardial infarctions but more acute kidney injury events than the heparin group; at 30 days, these differences were no longer significant.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this randomized trial of TAVR procedural pharmacotherapy, bivalirudin did not reduce rates of major bleeding at 48 h or net adverse cardiovascular events within 30 days compared with heparin. Although superiority was not shown, the noninferiority hypothesis was met with respect to the latter factor. Given the lower cost, heparin should remain the standard of care, and bivalirudin can be an alternative anticoagulant option in patients unable to receive heparin in TAVR.

      In a randomized, controlled trial that compared liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue, with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk who were receiving usual care, we found that liraglutide resulted in lower risks of the primary end point (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) and death. However, the long-term effects of liraglutide on renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes are unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We report the prespecified secondary renal outcomes of that randomized, controlled trial in which patients were assigned to receive liraglutide or placebo. The secondary renal outcome was a composite of new-onset persistent macroalbuminuria, persistent doubling of the serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or death due to renal disease. The risk of renal outcomes was determined with the use of time-to-event analyses with an intention-to-treat approach. Changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria were also analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 9340 patients underwent randomization, and the median follow-up of the patients was 3.84 years. The renal outcome occurred in fewer participants in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group (268 of 4668 patients vs. 337 of 4672; hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67 to 0.92; P=0.003). This result was driven primarily by the new onset of persistent macroalbuminuria, which occurred in fewer participants in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group (161 vs. 215 patients; hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.91; P=0.004). The rates of renal adverse events were similar in the liraglutide group and the placebo group (15.1 events and 16.5 events per 1000 patient-years), including the rate of acute kidney injury (7.1 and 6.2 events per 1000 patient-years, respectively).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This prespecified secondary analysis shows that, when added to usual care, liraglutide resulted in lower rates of the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease than placebo.

      The aim of this study was to compare 5-year cardiovascular, renal, and bioprosthetic valve durability outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).
    


          Background:
        
      
      Patients with severe AS and CKD undergoing TAVR or SAVR are a challenging, understudied clinical subset.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Intermediate-risk patients with moderate to severe CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/m2) from the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve) 2A trial (patients randomly assigned to SAPIEN XT TAVR or SAVR) and SAPIEN 3 Intermediate Risk Registry were pooled. The composite primary outcome of death, stroke, rehospitalization, and new hemodialysis was evaluated using Cox regression analysis. Patients with and without perioperative acute kidney injury (AKI) were followed through 5 years. A core laboratory-adjudicated analysis of structural valve deterioration and bioprosthetic valve failure was also performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study population included 1,045 TAVR patients (512 SAPIEN XT, 533 SAPIEN 3) and 479 SAVR patients. At 5 years, SAVR was better than SAPIEN XT TAVR (52.8% vs 68.0%; P = 0.04) but similar to SAPIEN 3 TAVR (52.8% vs 58.7%; P = 0.89). Perioperative AKI was more common after SAVR than TAVR (26.3% vs 10.3%; P < 0.001) and was independently associated with long-term outcomes. Compared with SAVR, bioprosthetic valve failure and stage 2 or 3 structural valve deterioration were significantly greater for SAPIEN XT TAVR (P < 0.05) but not for SAPIEN 3 TAVR.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In intermediate-risk patients with AS and CKD, SAPIEN 3 TAVR and SAVR were associated with a similar risk for the primary endpoint at 5 years. AKI was more common after SAVR than TAVR, and SAPIEN 3 valve durability was comparable with that of surgical bioprostheses."
Kidney injury molecule-1 staining in renal allograft biopsies 10 days after transplantation is inversely correlated with functioning proximal tubular epithelial cells.,"Jonna R Bank, Pieter van der Pol, Dianne Vreeken, Catherine Monge-Chaubo, Ingeborg M Bajema, Nicole Schlagwein, Daniëlle J van Gijlswijk, Sandra W van der Kooij, Marlies E J Reinders, Johan W de Fijter, Cees van Kooten, Jonna R Banket al.",2017 Dec 1,Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29045706/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) are promising biomarkers for monitoring delayed graft function (DGF) after kidney transplantation. Here we investigated localization and distribution of KIM-1 and NGAL staining in renal allograft biopsies and studied their association with histological features, functional DGF (fDGF) and the tubular function slope (TFS), a functioning proximal tubular epithelial cell (PTEC) marker.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Day 10 protocol biopsies of 64 donation after circulatory death recipients were stained for KIM-1 and NGAL and the positive area was quantified using ImageJ software. Biopsies were scored according to Banff and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) criteria. A 99mtechnetium-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3)-renography was performed to calculate TFS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      KIM-1 staining was located on the brush border of tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and correlated with denudation, while NGAL was present more focally in a cytoplasmic distribution. KIM-1 and NGAL staining were not correlated and no co-localization was observed. Quantitative stainings were not associated with fDGF, but KIM-1 tended to be higher in patients with prolonged fDGF (≥21 days; P = 0.062). No correlation was observed between the quantitative tissue stainings and urinary KIM-1 or NGAL. Quantitative KIM-1 staining was inversely correlated with the TFS (Spearman's ρ = -0.53; P < 0.001), whereas NGAL was not. The latter finding might be because cortical NGAL staining is dependent on filtration and subsequent reabsorption by functioning PTECs. Staining of NGAL was indeed restricted to PTECs, as shown by co-localization with a PTEC-specific lectin.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      KIM-1 and NGAL staining showed different localization and distribution. Quantitative KIM-1 staining was inversely correlated with functioning PTECs."
Evaluation of urea and creatinine change during continuous renal replacement therapy: effect of blood flow rate.,"Nigel Fealy, Leanne Aitken, Eugene du Toit, Michael Bailey, Ian Baldwin, Nigel Fealyet al.",2018 Mar,Crit Care Resusc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29458320/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine if faster blood flow rate (BFR) has an effect on solute maintenance in continuous renal replacement therapy.

          Participants:
        
      
      Critically ill adults requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were randomised to receive one of two BFRs: 150 mL/min or 250 mL/min.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Changes in urea and creatinine concentrations (percentage change from baseline) and delivered treatment for each 12-hour period were used to assess solute maintenance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      100 patients were randomised, with 96 completing the study (49 patients, 150 mL/min; 47 patients, 250 mL/min). There were a total of 854 12-hour periods (421 periods, 150 mL/min; 433 periods, 250 mL/ min). Mean hours of treatment per 12 hours was 6.3 hours (standard deviation [SD], 3.7) in the 150 mL/min group, and 6.7 hours (SD, 3.9) in the 250 mL/min group (P = 0.6). There was no difference between the two BFR groups for change in mean urea concentration (150 mL/min group, -0.06%; SD, 0.015; v 250 mL/min group, -0.07%; SD, 0.01; P = 0.42) or change in mean creatinine concentration (150 mL/min, -0.05%; SD, 0.01; v 250 mL/min, -0.08%; SD, 0.01; P = 0.18). Independent variables associated with a reduced percentage change in mean serum urea and creatinine concentrations were low haemoglobin levels (-0.01%; SD, 0.005; P = 0.002; and 0.01%; SD, 0.005; P = 0.006, respectively) and less hours treated (-0.023%; SD, 0.001; P = 0.000; and -0.02%; SD, 0.002; P = 0.001, respectively). No effect for bodyweight was found.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Faster BFR did not affect solute control in patients receiving CRRT; however, differences in urea and creatinine concentrations were influenced by serum haemoglobin and hours of treatment."
Permissible Intraabdominal Hypertension following Complex Abdominal Wall Reconstruction.,"Clayton C Petro, Siavash Raigani, Mojtaba Fayezizadeh, James R Rowbottom, John C Klick, Ajita S Prabhu, Yuri W Novitsky, Michael J Rosen, Clayton C Petroet al.",2015 Oct,Plast Reconstr Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26090761/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Repair of hernias with loss of domain can lead to elevated intraabdominal pressure. The authors aimed to characterize the effects of elective hernia repair on intraabdominal pressure, as well as its predictors and association with negative outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients undergoing elective hernia repair requiring myofascial release had intraabdominal and pulmonary plateau pressures measured preoperatively, postoperatively, and on the morning of the first postoperative day. Loss of domain was measured by preoperative computed tomography. Outcome measures included predictors of an increase in plateau pressure, respiratory complications, and acute kidney injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Following 50 consecutive cases, diagnoses of intraabdominal hypertension (92 percent), abdominal compartment syndrome (16 percent), and abdominal perfusion pressure less than 60 mmHg (24 percent) were determined. Changes in intraabdominal pressure (preoperative, 12.7 ± 4.0 mmHg; postoperative, 18.2 ± 5.4 mmHg; postoperative day 1, 12.9 ± 5.2 mmHg) and abdominal perfusion pressure (preoperative, 74.7 ± 15.7; postoperative, 70.0 ± 14.4; postoperative day 1, 74.9 ± 11.6 mmHg) consistently resolved by postoperative day 1, and were not associated with respiratory complications or acute kidney injury. Patients who remained intubated postoperatively for an elevation in pulmonary plateau pressure (≥6 mmHg) all demonstrated an improvement in plateau pressure by postoperative day 1 (preoperative, 18.9 ± 4.5 mmHg; postoperative, 27.4 ± 4.0 mmHg; postoperative day 1, 20.1 ± 3.7 mmHg), and could be identified preoperatively as having a hernia volume of greater than 20 percent of the abdominal cavity (p < 0.001), but were still more likely to have postoperative respiratory events (p = 0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Elevated intraabdominal pressure following elective hernia repair requiring myofascial releases is common but transient. Change in plateau pressure by 6 mmHg or more following repair can be expected with a loss of domain greater than 20 percent and is a more useful surrogate than intraabdominal pressure measurements with regard to predicting postoperative pulmonary complications. The perception and management of elevated intraabdominal pressure should be considered distinct and ""permissible"" in this context."
Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Outcomes of Peak-Trough-Based Versus Trough-Based Vancomycin Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Approaches: A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Fatima Khalifa Al-Sulaiti, Ahmed Mohamed Nader, Mohamed Omar Saad, Adila Shaukat, Rakesh Parakadavathu, Ahmed Elzubair, Daoud Al-Badriyeh, Hazem Elewa, Ahmed Awaisu, Fatima Khalifa Al-Sulaitiet al.",2019 Oct,Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30919233/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is based on achieving 24-h area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration cure breakpoints (AUC24/MIC). Approaches to vancomycin TDM vary, with no head-to-head randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparisons to date.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      We aimed to compare clinical and pharmacokinetic outcomes between peak-trough-based and trough-only-based vancomycin TDM approaches and to determine the relationship between vancomycin AUC24/MIC and cure rates.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multicentered pragmatic parallel-group RCT was conducted in Hamad Medical Corporation hospitals in Qatar. Adult non-dialysis patients initiated on vancomycin were randomized to peak-trough-based or trough-only-based vancomycin TDM. Primary endpoints included vancomycin AUC24/MIC ratio breakpoint for cure and clinical effectiveness (therapeutic cure vs therapeutic failure). Descriptive, inferential, and classification and regression tree (CART) statistical analyses were applied. NONMEM.v.7.3 was used to conduct population pharmacokinetic analyses and AUC24 calculations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-five patients were enrolled [trough-only-based-TDM (n = 35) and peak-trough-based-TDM (n = 30)]. Peak-trough-based TDM was significantly associated with higher therapeutic cure rates compared to trough-only-based TDM [76.7% vs 48.6%; p value = 0.02]. No statistically significant differences were observed for all-cause mortality, neutropenia, or nephrotoxicity between the two groups. Compared to trough-only-based TDM, peak-trough-based TDM was associated with less vancomycin total daily doses by 12.05 mg/kg/day (p value = 0.027). CART identified creatinine clearance (CLCR), AUC24/MIC, and TDM approach as significant determinants of therapeutic outcomes. All patients [n = 19,100%] with CLCR ≤ 7.85 L/h, AUC24/MIC ≤ 1256, who received peak-trough-based TDM achieved therapeutic cure. AUC24/MIC > 565 was identified to be correlated with cure in trough-only-based TDM recipients [n = 11,84.6%]. No minimum AUC24/MIC breakpoint was detected by CART in the peak-trough-based group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Maintenance of target vancomycin exposures and implementation of peak-trough-based vancomycin TDM may improve vancomycin-associated cure rates. Larger scale RCTs are warranted to confirm these findings."
177 Lu-DOTATATE PRRT Safety and Organ-at-Risk Dosimetry in Patients With Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors : Data From the Prospective Phase 2 LUMEN Study.,"Magdalena Mileva, Camille Van Bogaert, Gwennaëlle Marin, Rachele Danieli, Carlos Artigas, Hugo Levillain, Lieveke Ameye, Loubna Taraji-Schiltz, Konstantinos Stathopoulos, Zéna Wimana, Alain Hendlisz, Patrick Flamen, Ioannis Karfis, Magdalena Milevaet al.",2024 Sep 1,Clin Nucl Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38914016/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to assess the association among toxicity, dosimetry of organs-at-risk, and disease progression in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) treated with 177 Lu-DOTATATE.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Thirty-seven patients with GEP-NETs underwent 177 Lu-DOTATATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in a single-arm, prospective, phase 2 study, where patients were followed up with blood tests, isotopic glomerular filtration rate (iGFR), and imaging examinations (CT/MRI and PET) every 6 months until disease progression. Adverse events (AEs) graded per CTCAEv4.03 and occurring during treatment were collected and followed up until resolution. Dosimetry, including biologically effective doses (BEDs) to kidneys, BED to bone marrow, and absorbed dose (AD) to spleen, was performed after each PRRT cycle. Statistical analyses explored associations among dosimetry, toxicity, and patient progression free-survival.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The most common AEs were anemia and lymphopenia (65%), followed by thrombocytopenia and fatigue (each 51%), alopecia (46%), and nausea (41%). The most common grade ≥3 AE was lymphopenia (43%). There was no grade ≥3 nephrotoxicity. The median iGFR % decrease was 11% ( P < 0.001), at a median follow-up of 23 months. iGFR %decrease and renal BED did not correlate (Spearman ρ = -0.09). Similarly, no significant association was found between bone marrow BED or spleen AD and the grades of hematological toxicities. We observed no association between progression free-survival and either the decline of renal function or the occurrence of hematological toxicities during PRRT.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study confirms the safety profile of 177 Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients with GEP-NETs irrespective of the dosimetry of organs at risk. Kidney, bone marrow, and spleen dosimetry measures were not associated with renal or hematological toxicity."
Faster Blood Flow Rate Does Not Improve Circuit Life in Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Nigel Fealy, Leanne Aitken, Eugene du Toit, Serigne Lo, Ian Baldwin, Nigel Fealyet al.",2017 Oct,Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28658026/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      To determine whether blood flow rate influences circuit life in continuous renal replacement therapy.

      Prospective randomized controlled trial.
    


          Setting:

          Patients:
        
      
      Critically ill adults requiring continuous renal replacement therapy.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were randomized to receive one of two blood flow rates: 150 or 250 mL/min.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      The primary outcome was circuit life measured in hours. Circuit and patient data were collected until each circuit clotted or was ceased electively for nonclotting reasons. Data for clotted circuits are presented as median (interquartile range) and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Survival probability for clotted circuits was compared using log-rank test. Circuit clotting data were analyzed for repeated events using hazards ratio. One hundred patients were randomized with 96 completing the study (150 mL/min, n = 49; 250 mL/min, n = 47) using 462 circuits (245 run at 150 mL/min and 217 run at 250 mL/min). Median circuit life for first circuit (clotted) was similar for both groups (150 mL/min: 9.1 hr [5.5-26 hr] vs 10 hr [4.2-17 hr]; p = 0.37). Continuous renal replacement therapy using blood flow rate set at 250 mL/min was not more likely to cause clotting compared with 150 mL/min (hazards ratio, 1.00 [0.60-1.69]; p = 0.68). Gender, body mass index, weight, vascular access type, length, site, and mode of continuous renal replacement therapy or international normalized ratio had no effect on clotting risk. Continuous renal replacement therapy without anticoagulation was more likely to cause clotting compared with use of heparin strategies (hazards ratio, 1.62; p = 0.003). Longer activated partial thromboplastin time (hazards ratio, 0.98; p = 0.002) and decreased platelet count (hazards ratio, 1.19; p = 0.03) were associated with a reduced likelihood of circuit clotting.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There was no difference in circuit life whether using blood flow rates of 250 or 150 mL/min during continuous renal replacement therapy."
Personalized (177)Lu-octreotate peptide receptor radionuclide therapy of neuroendocrine tumours: initial results from the P-PRRT trial.,"Michela Del Prete, François-Alexandre Buteau, Frédéric Arsenault, Nassim Saighi, Louis-Olivier Bouchard, Alexis Beaulieu, Jean-Mathieu Beauregard, Michela Del Preteet al.",2019 Mar,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30506283/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is mostly administered using a fixed injected activity (IA) per cycle. This empiric regime results in highly variable absorbed doses to the critical organs and undertreatment of the majority of patients. We conceived a personalized PRRT protocol in which the IA is adjusted to deliver a prescribed absorbed dose to the kidney, with the aim to safely increase tumour irradiation. We herein report on the initial results of our prospective study of personalized PRRT, the P-PRRT Trial (NCT02754297).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      PRRT-naïve patients with progressive and/or symptomatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET) were scheduled to receive a four-cycle induction course of 177Lu-octreotate with quantitative SPECT/CT-based dosimetry. The IA was personalized according to the glomerular filtration rate and the body surface area for the first cycle, and according to the prior renal Gy/GBq for the subsequent cycles. The prescribed renal absorbed dose of 23 Gy was reduced by 25-50% in case of significant renal or haematological impairment. Responders were allowed to receive consolidation or maintenance cycles, for each of which 6 Gy to the kidney were prescribed. We simulated the empiric PRRT regime by fixing the IA at 7.4 GBq per cycle, with the same percentage reductions as above. Radiological, molecular imaging, biochemical, and quality of life responses, as well as safety, were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-two patients underwent 171 cycles. In 34 patients who completed the induction course, a median cumulative IA of 36.1 (range, 6.3-78.6) GBq was administered, and the median cumulative kidney and maximum tumour absorbed doses were 22.1 (range, 8.3-24.3) Gy and 185.7 (range: 15.2-443.1) Gy respectively. Compared with the simulated fixed-IA induction regime, there was a median 1.26-fold increase (range, 0.47-2.12 fold) in the cumulative maximum tumour absorbed dose, which was higher in 85.3% of patients. In 39 assessable patients, the best objective response was partial response in nine (23.1%), minor response in 14 (35.9%), stable disease in 13 (33.3%) and progressive disease in three patients (7.7%). In particular, 11 of 13 patients (84.6%) with pancreatic NET had partial or minor response. The global health status/quality of life score significantly increased in 50% of patients. Acute and subacute side-effects were all of grade 1 or 2, and the most common were nausea (in 32.7% of patients) and fatigue (in 30.8% of patients) respectively. Subacute grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred in less than 10% of patients, with the exception of lymphocytopenia in 51.9% of patients, without any clinical consequences however. No patient experienced severe renal toxicity.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Personalized PRRT makes it possible to safely increase tumour irradiation in the majority of patients. Our first results indicate a favourable tolerance profile, which appears similar to that of the empiric regime. The response rates are promising, in particular in patients with NET of pancreatic origin."
Impact of pretreatment with carnitine and tadalafil on contrast-induced nephropathy in CKD patients.,"Zaher Armaly, Suheil Artol, Adel R Jabbour, Amer Saffouri, Nayef Habashi, Amir Abd Elkadir, Naser Ghattas, Raymond Farah, Safa Kinaneh, William Nseir, Zaher Armalyet al.",2019 Nov,Ren Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31797710/,"NGAL, Radiocontrast, acute kidney injury, carnitine, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor.","Objective: The present study assesses whether phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor or carnitine exert nephroprotective effects against clinical contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).Materials and Methods: The present study consisted of three groups of CKD patients. The first group was control group, who were treated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine 1 day before and on the day of radiocontrast administration. The second one was carnitine group, where the patients were infused with carnitine over 10 min 2 h prior to the radiocontrast administration and 24 h post CT. The third one was PDE-5 inhibitor group, where patients were given tadalafil 2 h prior to the administration of the radiocontrast and in the subsequent day. Urine and blood samples were collected before and at the following time sequence: 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 120 h after the contrast administration, for creatinine and NGAL determination.Results: Pretreated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine prior to administration of contrast media (CM) to CKD patients caused a significant increase in urinary but not of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and serum creatinine (SCr). In contrast, pretreatment with carnitine prevented the increase in urinary NGAL and reduced SCr below basal levels. Similarly, tadalafil administration diminished the elevation of CM-induced urinary NGAL.Conclusions: These results indicate that carnitine and PDE-5 inhibitors may comprise potential therapeutic maneuvers for CIN."
Hemoconcentration of Creatinine Minimally Contributes to Changes in Creatinine during the Treatment of Decompensated Heart Failure.,"Christopher Maulion, Sheldon Chen, Veena S Rao, Juan B Ivey-Miranda, Zachary L Cox, Devin Mahoney, Steven G Coca, Dan Negoianu, Jennifer L Asher, Jeffrey M Turner, Lesley A Inker, F Perry Wilson, Jeffrey M Testani, Christopher Maulionet al.",2022 Apr 18,Kidney360,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35845336/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Worsening serum creatinine is common during treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). A possible contributor to creatinine increase is diuresis-induced changes in volume of distribution (VD) of creatinine as total body water (TBW) contracts around a fixed mass of creatinine. Our objective was to better understand the filtration and nonfiltration factors driving change in creatinine during ADHF.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants in the ROSE-AHF trial with baseline to 72-hour serum creatinine; net fluid output; and urinary KIM-1, NGAL, and NAG were included (n=270). Changes in VD were calculated by accounting for measured input and outputs from weight-based calculated TBW. Changes in observed creatinine (Crobserved) were compared with predicted changes in creatinine after accounting for alterations in VD and non-steady state conditions using a kinetic GFR equation (Cr72HR Kinetic).
    


          Results:
        
      
      When considering only change in VD, the median diuresis to elicit a ≥0.3 mg/dl rise in creatinine was -7526 ml (IQR, -5932 to -9149). After accounting for stable creatinine filtration during diuresis, a change in VD alone was insufficient to elicit a ≥0.3 mg/dl rise in creatinine. Larger estimated decreases in VD were paradoxically associated with improvement in Crobserved (r=-0.18, P=0.003). Overall, -3% of the change in eCr72HR Kinetic was attributable to the change in VD. A ≥0.3 mg/dl rise in eCr72HR Kinetic was not associated with worsening of KIM-1, NGAL, NAG, or postdischarge survival (P>0.05 for all).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      During ADHF therapy, increases in serum creatinine are driven predominantly by changes in filtration, with minimal contribution from change in VD."

Clinical, pathological and laboratory data were collected to investigate the relationship between renal function, immunotherapy and cancer-related outcomes. Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine-equation 2009 were reported at baseline and after every cycle of pembrolizumab; the T stage from clinical classification TNM (cTNM) was stated before the treatment. Our analysis did not demonstrate a significant impairment of eGFR after any cycle of pembrolizumab, neither in the overall cohort nor in subgroups considering the T stages or the CKD G-categories according to K-DIGO 2012 classification. In conclusion, in neoadjuvant setting before RC our results suggest that pembrolizumab administration is safe for renal function preservation."

      We conducted a multinational, randomized, controlled trial involving critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an accelerated strategy of renal-replacement therapy (in which therapy was initiated within 12 hours after the patient had met eligibility criteria) or a standard strategy (in which renal-replacement therapy was discouraged unless conventional indications developed or acute kidney injury persisted for >72 hours).

      Of the 3019 patients who had undergone randomization, 2927 (97.0%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (1465 in the accelerated-strategy group and 1462 in the standard-strategy group). Of these patients, renal-replacement therapy was performed in 1418 (96.8%) in the accelerated-strategy group and in 903 (61.8%) in the standard-strategy group. At 90 days, death had occurred in 643 patients (43.9%) in the accelerated-strategy group and in 639 (43.7%) in the standard-strategy group (relative risk, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93 to 1.09; P = 0.92). Among survivors at 90 days, continued dependence on renal-replacement therapy was confirmed in 85 of 814 patients (10.4%) in the accelerated-strategy group and in 49 of 815 patients (6.0%) in the standard-strategy group (relative risk, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.43). Adverse events occurred in 346 of 1503 patients (23.0%) in the accelerated-strategy group and in 245 of 1489 patients (16.5%) in the standard-strategy group (P<0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury, an accelerated renal-replacement strategy was not associated with a lower risk of death at 90 days than a standard strategy.

Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitor- to Belatacept-Based Maintenance Immunosuppression in Renal Transplant Recipients: A Randomized Phase 3b Trial.,"Klemens Budde, Rohini Prashar, Hermann Haller, Maria C Rial, Nassim Kamar, Avinash Agarwal, Johan W de Fijter, Lionel Rostaing, Stefan P Berger, Arjang Djamali, Nicolae Leca, Lisa Allamassey, Sheng Gao, Martin Polinsky, Flavio Vincenti, Klemens Buddeet al.",2021 Dec 1,J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34706967/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are standard of care after kidney transplantation, but they are associated with nephrotoxicity and reduced long-term graft survival. Belatacept, a selective T cell costimulation blocker, is approved for the prophylaxis of kidney transplant rejection. This phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of conversion from CNI-based to belatacept-based maintenance immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Stable adult kidney transplant recipients 6-60 months post-transplantation under CNI-based immunosuppression were randomized (1:1) to switch to belatacept or continue treatment with their established CNI. The primary end point was the percentage of patients surviving with a functioning graft at 24 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 446 renal transplant recipients were randomized to belatacept conversion ( n =223) or CNI continuation ( n =223). The 24-month rates of survival with graft function were 98% and 97% in the belatacept and CNI groups, respectively (adjusted difference, 0.8; 95.1% CI, -2.1 to 3.7). In the belatacept conversion versus CNI continuation groups, 8% versus 4% of patients experienced biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), respectively, and 1% versus 7% developed de novo donor-specific antibodies (dnDSAs), respectively. The 24-month eGFR was higher with belatacept (55.5 versus 48.5 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 with CNI). Both groups had similar rates of serious adverse events, infections, and discontinuations, with no unexpected adverse events. One patient in the belatacept group had post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Switching stable renal transplant recipients from CNI-based to belatacept-based immunosuppression was associated with a similar rate of death or graft loss, improved renal function, and a numerically higher BPAR rate but a lower incidence of dnDSA.Clinical Trial registry name and registration number: A Study in Maintenance Kidney Transplant Recipients Following Conversion to Nulojix® (Belatacept)-Based, NCT01820572."

It is unknown whether urine kidney injury biomarkers are associated with poor outcomes among KTRs. We conducted a post hoc analysis of the Folic Acid for Vascular Outcome Reduction in Transplantation (FAVORIT) Trial using a case-cohort study design, selecting participants with adjudicated cardiovascular events, graft failure, or death. Urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), IL-18, and liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) were measured in spot urine samples and standardized to urine creatinine concentration. We adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, eGFR, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Patients had 291 cardiovascular events, 257 graft failure events, and 359 deaths. Each log increase in urine NGAL/creatinine independently associated with a 24% greater risk of cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.06 to 1.45), a 40% greater risk of graft failure (aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.68), and a 44% greater risk of death (aHR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.65). Urine KIM-1/creatinine and IL-18/creatinine independently associated with greater risk of death (aHR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.61 and aHR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.49 per log increase, respectively) but not with risk of cardiovascular events or graft failure. Urine L-FABP did not associate with any study outcomes. In conclusion, among prevalent KTRs, higher urine NGAL, KIM-1, and IL-18 levels independently and differentially associated with greater risk of adverse outcomes."
Processed electroencephalography-guided general anesthesia and norepinephrine requirements: A randomized trial in patients having vascular surgery.,"Kristen K Thomsen, Daniel I Sessler, Linda Krause, Phillip Hoppe, Benjamin Opitz, Till Kessler, Viorel Chindris, Alina Bergholz, Moritz Flick, Karim Kouz, Christian Zöllner, Leonie Schulte-Uentrop, Bernd Saugel, Kristen K Thomsenet al.",2024 Aug:95:111459.,J Clin Anesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38599161/,No keywords found,"Study objective:
        
      
      Processed electroencephalography (pEEG) may help clinicians optimize depth of general anesthesia. Avoiding excessive depth of anesthesia may reduce intraoperative hypotension and the need for vasopressors. We tested the hypothesis that pEEG-guided - compared to non-pEEG-guided - general anesthesia reduces the amount of norepinephrine needed to keep intraoperative mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg in patients having vascular surgery.
    


          Design:

          Setting:
        
      
      University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      110 patients having vascular surgery.
    


          Interventions:

          Measurements:
        
      
      Our primary endpoint was the average norepinephrine infusion rate from the beginning of induction of anesthesia until the end of surgery.
    


          Main result:
        
      
      96 patients were analyzed. The mean ± standard deviation average norepinephrine infusion rate was 0.08 ± 0.04 μg kg-1 min-1 in patients assigned to pEEG-guided and 0.12 ± 0.09 μg kg-1 min-1 in patients assigned to non-pEEG-guided general anesthesia (mean difference 0.04 μg kg-1 min-1, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.07 μg kg-1 min-1, p = 0.004). Patients assigned to pEEG-guided versus non-pEEG-guided general anesthesia, had a median time-weighted minimum alveolar concentration of 0.7 (0.6, 0.8) versus 0.8 (0.7, 0.8) (p = 0.006) and a median percentage of time Patient State Index was <25 of 12 (1, 41) % versus 23 (3, 49) % (p = 0.279).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      pEEG-guided - compared to non-pEEG-guided - general anesthesia reduced the amount of norepinephrine needed to keep mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg by about a third in patients having vascular surgery. Whether reduced intraoperative norepinephrine requirements resulting from pEEG-guided general anesthesia translate into improved patient-centered outcomes remains to be determined in larger trials."
"Dynamic Coronary Roadmap versus standard angiography for percutaneous coronary intervention: the randomised, multicentre DCR4Contrast trial.","Breda Hennessey, Haim Danenberg, Frédéric De Vroey, Ajay J Kirtane, Manish Parikh, Dimitrios Karmpaliotis, John C Messenger, Aaron Strobel, Alejandro Curcio, Martijn S van Mourik, Peter Eshuis, Javier Escaned, Breda Hennesseyet al.",2024 Feb 5,EuroIntervention,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38343370/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Decreasing the amount of iodinated contrast is an important safety aspect of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), particularly in patients with a high risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). Dynamic Coronary Roadmap (DCR) is a PCI navigation support tool projecting a motion-compensated virtual coronary roadmap overlay on fluoroscopy, potentially limiting the need for contrast during PCI.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      This study investigates the contrast-sparing potential of DCR in PCI, compared to standard angiographic guidance.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Dynamic Coronary Roadmap for Contrast Reduction (DCR4Contrast) trial is a multicentre, international, prospective, unblinded, stratified 1:1 randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomised to either DCR-guided PCI or to conventional angiography-guided PCI. The primary endpoint was the total volume of iodinated contrast administered, and the secondary endpoint was the number of cineangiography runs during PCI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study population included 356 randomised patients (179 in DCR and 177 in control groups, respectively). There were no differences in patient demographics, angiographic characteristics or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between the two groups. The total contrast volume used during PCI was significantly lower with DCR guidance compared with conventional angiographic guidance (64.6±44.4 ml vs 90.8±55.4 ml, respectively; p<0.001). The total number of cineangiography runs was also significantly reduced in the DCR group (8.7±4.7 vs 11.7±7.6 in the control group; p<0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Compared to conventional angiography-guided PCI, DCR guidance was associated with a significant reduction in both contrast volume and the number of cineangiography runs during PCI. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04085614)."
Perioperative glutamine supplementation restores disturbed renal arginine synthesis after open aortic surgery: a randomized controlled clinical trial.,"Saskia J H Brinkmann, Nikki Buijs, Mechteld A R Vermeulen, Efraim Oosterink, Henk Schierbeek, Albertus Beishuizen, Jean-Paul P M de Vries, Willem Wisselink, Paul A M van Leeuwen, Saskia J H Brinkmannet al.",2016 Sep 1,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27194717/,"acute kidney injury, arginine, citrulline, glutamine, ischemia-reperfusion injury.","Postoperative renal failure is a common complication after open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The amino acid arginine is formed in the kidneys from its precursor citrulline, and citrulline is formed from glutamine in the intestines. Arginine enhances the function of the immune and cardiovascular systems, which is important for recovery after surgery. We hypothesized that renal arginine production is diminished after ischemia-reperfusion injury caused by clamping of the aorta during open abdominal aortic surgery and that parenteral glutamine supplementation might compensate for this impaired arginine synthesis. This open-label clinical trial randomized patients who underwent clamping of the aorta during open abdominal aortic surgery to receive a perioperative supplement of intravenous alanyl-glutamine (0.5 g·kg(-1)·day(-1); group A, n = 5) or no supplement (group B, n = 5). One day after surgery, stable isotopes and tracer methods were used to analyze the metabolism and conversion of glutamine, citrulline, and arginine. Whole body plasma flux of glutamine, citrulline, and arginine was significantly higher in group A than in group B (glutamine: 391 ± 34 vs. 258 ± 19 μmol·kg(-1)·h(-1), citrulline: 5.7 ± 0.4 vs. 2.8 ± 0.4 μmol·kg(-1)·h(-1), and arginine: 50 ± 4 vs. 26 ± 2 μmol·kg(-1)·h(-1), P < 0.01), as was the synthesis of citrulline from glutamine (4.8 ± 0.7 vs. 1.6 ± 0.3 μmol·kg(-1)·h(-1)), citrulline from arginine (2.3 ± 0.3 vs. 0.96 ± 0.1 μmol·kg(-1)·h(-1)), and arginine from glutamine (7.7 ± 0.4 vs. 2.8 ± 0.2 μmol·kg(-1)·h(-1)), respectively (P < 0.001 for all). In conclusion, the production of citrulline and arginine is severely reduced after clamping during aortic surgery. This study shows that an intravenous supplement of glutamine increases the production of citrulline and arginine and compensates for the inhibitory effect of ischemia-reperfusion injury."

      On the basis of low-quality evidence, international critical care nutrition guidelines recommend a wide range of protein doses. The effect of delivering high-dose protein during critical illness is unknown. We aimed to test the hypothesis that a higher dose of protein provided to critically ill patients would improve their clinical outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This international, investigator-initiated, pragmatic, registry-based, single-blinded, randomised trial was undertaken in 85 intensive care units (ICUs) across 16 countries. We enrolled nutritionally high-risk adults (≥18 years) undergoing mechanical ventilation to compare prescribing high-dose protein (≥2·2 g/kg per day) with usual dose protein (≤1·2 g/kg per day) started within 96 h of ICU admission and continued for up to 28 days or death or transition to oral feeding. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to high-dose protein or usual dose protein, stratified by site. As site personnel were involved in both prescribing and delivering protein dose, it was not possible to blind clinicians, but patients were not made aware of the treatment assignment. The primary efficacy outcome was time-to-discharge-alive from hospital up to 60 days after ICU admission and the secondary outcome was 60-day morality. Patients were analysed in the group to which they were randomly assigned regardless of study compliance, although patients who dropped out of the study before receiving the study intervention were excluded. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03160547.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Jan 17, 2018, and Dec 3, 2021, 1329 patients were randomised and 1301 (97·9%) were included in the analysis (645 in the high-dose protein group and 656 in usual dose group). By 60 days after randomisation, the cumulative incidence of alive hospital discharge was 46·1% (95 CI 42·0%-50·1%) in the high-dose compared with 50·2% (46·0%-54·3%) in the usual dose protein group (hazard ratio 0·91, 95% CI 0·77-1·07; p=0·27). The 60-day mortality rate was 34·6% (222 of 642) in the high dose protein group compared with 32·1% (208 of 648) in the usual dose protein group (relative risk 1·08, 95% CI 0·92-1·26). There appeared to be a subgroup effect with higher protein provision being particularly harmful in patients with acute kidney injury and higher organ failure scores at baseline.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Delivery of higher doses of protein to mechanically ventilated critically ill patients did not improve the time-to-discharge-alive from hospital and might have worsened outcomes for patients with acute kidney injury and high organ failure scores.

      Measures of kidney tubule health are risk markers for acute kidney injury (AKI) in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD) during hypertension treatment, but their associations with other adverse events (AEs) are unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Among 2377 Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) participants with CKD, we measured at baseline eight urine biomarkers of kidney tubule health and two serum biomarkers of mineral metabolism pathways that act on the kidney tubules. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate biomarker associations with risk of a composite of pre-specified serious AEs (hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, AKI, bradycardia and injurious falls) and outpatient AEs (hyperkalemia and hypokalemia).
    


          Results:
        
      
      At baseline, the mean age was 73 ± 9 years and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 46 ± 11 mL/min/1.73 m2. During a median follow-up of 3.8 years, 716 (30%) participants experienced the composite AE. Higher urine interleukin-18, kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), lower urine uromodulin (UMOD) and higher serum fibroblast growth factor-23 were individually associated with higher risk of the composite AE outcome in multivariable-adjusted models including eGFR and albuminuria. When modeling biomarkers in combination, higher NGAL [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.08 per 2-fold higher biomarker level, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.13], higher MCP-1 (HR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.03-1.19) and lower UMOD (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97) were each associated with higher composite AE risk. Biomarker associations did not vary by intervention arm (P > 0.10 for all interactions).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among persons with CKD, several kidney tubule biomarkers are associated with higher risk of AEs during hypertension treatment, independent of eGFR and albuminuria."

      The study comprised of a cluster-randomized, controlled trial to assess the impact of a multifaceted intervention of education, guideline development, elimination of recurring laboratory orders, unbundling of laboratory panels, and redesign of the daily progress note on laboratory test ordering. The population included all patients hospitalized ""general medicine"" was duplicated during 2 consecutive months on a general medicine teaching service within a 999-bed tertiary care hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. The primary outcome was the total number of commonly used laboratory tests per patient day during 2 months in 2008.

          Results:
        
      
      A total of 5392 patient days were captured. The intervention produced a 9% decrease in aggregate laboratory use (rate ratio, 0.91; P = .021; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.98). Six instances of delayed diagnosis of acute kidney injury and 11 near misses were reported in the intervention arm.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A bundled educational and administrative intervention promoting rational ordering of laboratory tests on a single academic general medicine service led to a modest but significant decrease in laboratory use. To our knowledge, this was the first study to examine the daily progress note as a tool to limit excessive test ordering. Unadjudicated near misses and possible harm were reported with this intervention. This finding warrants further study."
Using machine learning methods to predict 28-day mortality in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.,"Zhe Zhang#, Jian Wang#, Wei Han, Li Zhao, Zhe Zhanget al.",2023 Apr 6,BMC Gastroenterol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37024814/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with marked increases in morbidity and mortality for cirrhosis patients. This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models to predict 28-day mortality for patients with HE.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients from MIMIC-IV were randomized into training and validation cohorts in a ratio of 7:3. Training cohort was used for establishing the model while validation cohort was used for validation. The outcome was defined as 28-day mortality. Predictors were identified by recursive feature elimination (RFE) within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve were used to determine the predictive performance of different ML models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the MIMIC-IV database, 601 patients were eventually diagnosed with HE. Of these, 112 (18.64%) experienced death within 28 days. Acute physiology score III (APSIII), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), international normalized ratio (INR), total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), acute kidney injury (AKI) and mechanical ventilation were identified as independent risk factors. Validation set indicated that the artificial neural network (NNET) model had the highest AUC of 0.837 (95% CI:0.774-0.901). Furthermore, in the calibration curve, the NNET model was also well-calibrated (P = 0.323), which means that it can better predict the 28-day mortality in HE patients. Additionally, the performance of the NNET is superior to existing scores, including Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this study, the NNET model demonstrated better discrimination in predicting 28-day mortality as compared to other models. This developed model could potentially improve the early detection of HE with high mortality, subsequently improving clinical outcomes in these patients with HE, but further external prospective validation is still required."

      There is controversy regarding the optimal renal-replacement therapy (RRT) modality for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a secondary analysis of the STandard versus Accelerated Renal Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury (STARRT-AKI) trial to compare outcomes among patients who initiated RRT with either continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). We generated a propensity score for the likelihood of receiving CRRT and used inverse probability of treatment with overlap-weighting to address baseline inter-group differences. The primary outcome was a composite of death or RRT dependence at 90-days after randomization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 1590 trial participants who initially received CRRT and 606 who initially received IHD. The composite outcome of death or RRT dependence at 90-days occurred in 823 (51.8%) patients who commenced CRRT and 329 (54.3%) patients who commenced IHD (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-1.09). After balancing baseline characteristics with overlap weighting, initial receipt of CRRT was associated with a lower risk of death or RRT dependence at 90-days compared with initial receipt of IHD (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.66-0.99). This association was predominantly driven by a lower risk of RRT dependence at 90-days (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.39-0.94).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In critically ill patients with severe AKI, initiation of CRRT, as compared to IHD, was associated with a significant reduction in the composite outcome of death or RRT dependence at 90-days."
Pilot multi-centre randomised trial of the impact of pre-operative focused cardiac ultrasound on mortality and morbidity in patients having surgery for femoral neck fractures (ECHONOF-2 pilot).,"D J Canty, J Heiberg, Y Yang, A G Royse, S Margale, N Nanjappa, D Scott, A Maier, D I Sessler, A Chuan, A Palmer, A Bucknill, C French, C F Royse, D J Cantyet al.",2018 Apr,Anaesthesia,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29226957/,"echocardiography, hip fracture surgery, pre-operative assessment.","Hip fracture surgery is common, usually occurs in elderly patients who have multiple comorbidities, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Pre-operative focused cardiac ultrasound can alter diagnosis and management, but its impact on outcome remains uncertain. This pilot study assessed feasibility and group separation for a proposed large randomised clinical trial of the impact of pre-operative focused cardiac ultrasound on patient outcome after hip fracture surgery. Adult patients requiring hip fracture surgery in four teaching hospitals in Australia were randomly allocated to receive focused cardiac ultrasound before surgery or not. The primary composite outcome was any death, acute kidney injury, non-fatal myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism or cardiopulmonary arrest within 30 days of surgery. Of the 175 patients screened, 100 were included as trial participants (screening:recruitment ratio 1.7:1), 49 in the ultrasound group and 51 as controls. There was one protocol failure among those recruited. The primary composite outcome occurred in seven of the ultrasound group patients and 12 of the control group patients (relative group separation 39%). Death, acute kidney injury and cerebrovascular accident were recorded, but no cases of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism or cardiopulmonary arrest ocurred. Focused cardiac ultrasound altered the management of 17 participants, suggesting an effect mechanism. This pilot study demonstrated that enrolment and the protocol are feasible, that the primary composite outcome is appropriate, and that there is a treatment effect favouring focused cardiac ultrasound - and therefore supports a large randomised clinical trial."
A model-based analysis of the predictive performance of different renal function markers for cefepime clearance in the ICU.,"Stijn Jonckheere, Nikolaas De Neve, Hans De Beenhouwer, Mario Berth, An Vermeulen, Jan Van Bocxlaer, Pieter Colin, Stijn Jonckheereet al.",2016 Sep,J Antimicrob Chemother,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27246236/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Several population pharmacokinetic models for cefepime in critically ill patients have been described, which all indicate that variability in renal clearance is the main determinant of the observed variability in exposure. The main objective of this study was to determine which renal marker best predicts cefepime clearance.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM based on 208 plasma and 51 urine samples from 20 ICU patients during a median follow-up of 3 days. Four serum-based kidney markers (creatinine, cystatin C, urea and uromodulin) and two urinary markers [measured creatinine clearance (CLCR) and kidney injury molecule-1] were evaluated as covariates in the model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A two-compartment model incorporating a renal and non-renal clearance component along with an additional term describing haemodialysis clearance provided an adequate description of the data. The Cockcroft-Gault formula was the best predictor for renal cefepime clearance. Compared with the base model without covariates, the objective function value decreased from 1971.7 to 1948.1, the median absolute prediction error from 42.4% to 29.9% and the between-subject variability in renal cefepime clearance from 135% to 50%. Other creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae and measured CLCR performed similarly. Monte Carlo simulations using the Sanford guide dose recommendations indicated an insufficient dose reduction in patients with a decreased kidney function, leading to potentially toxic levels.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The Cockcroft-Gault formula was the best predictor for cefepime clearance in critically ill patients, although other creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae and measured CLCR performed similarly."

      Delayed graft function due to ischaemia-reperfusion injury is a frequent complication in deceased donor renal transplantation. Experimental evidence indicates that remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) provides systemic protection against ischaemia-reperfusion injury in various tissues.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      'Remote ischaemic conditioning in renal transplantation--effect on immediate and extended kidney graft function' (the CONTEXT study) is an investigator initiated, multicentre, randomised controlled trial investigating whether RIC of the leg of the recipient improves short and long-term graft function following deceased donor kidney transplantation. The study will include 200 kidney transplant recipients of organ donation after brain death and 20 kidney transplant recipients of organ donation after circulatory death. Participants are randomised in a 1:1 design to RIC or sham-RIC (control). RIC consists of four cycles of 5 min occlusion of the thigh by a tourniquet inflated to 250 mm Hg, separated by 5 min of deflation. Primary end point is the time to a 50% reduction from the baseline plasma creatinine, estimated from the changes of plasma creatinine values 30 days post-transplant or 30 days after the last performed dialysis post-transplant. Secondary end points are: need of dialysis post-transplant, measured and estimated-glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 3 and 12 months after transplantation, patient and renal graft survival, number of rejection episodes in the first year, and changes in biomarkers of acute kidney injury and inflammation in plasma, urine and graft tissue.

      Fluid overload has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a diuretic strategy to overcome positive fluid balance in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Design: Multicenter, single-blind, randomized-controlled study. Patients were randomized into a diuretic (furosemide) or a control group. Patients were eligible in case of fluid overload defined as in-ICU weight increase ≥ 3%, invasive mechanical ventilation (FiO2 ≤ 60% and PEEP ≤ 10 cm H2O on inclusion) and hemodynamic stabilization. The primary outcome was fluid balance, defined as weight variation from reference weight to successful extubation. The main secondary outcome was the safety of diuretic.
    


          Results:
        
      
      171 patients were randomized. After 5 exclusions, 166 patients were included in the analysis: 77 in the diuretic and 89 in the control group. Fluid balance was 1.4 [- 2.5 to 4.5] kg in the diuretic and 6.4 [0.5-11.2] kg in the control group (p < 0.001). In the multiple imputation analysis, fluid balance was significantly decreased in the diuretic group (mean difference = - 4.8 95% CI [- 7.3 to - 2.5], p < 0.001). Eleven (14%) patients died in the diuretic group and 16 (18%) patients in the control group (p = 0.5). There was a worsening of Acute Kidney Injury in 67 (75.3%) patients of the control group versus 46 (59.7%) patients in the diuretic group (p = 0.03).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this multicenter randomized-controlled study, protocolized diuretic therapy reduced fluid accumulation in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.

A predictive model for the risk of sepsis within 30 days of admission in patients with traumatic brain injury in the intensive care unit: a retrospective analysis based on MIMIC-IV database.,"Fangqi Hu#, Jiaqiu Zhu#, Sheng Zhang, Cheng Wang, Liangjia Zhang, Hui Zhou, Hui Shi, Fangqi Huet al.",2023 Aug 18,Eur J Med Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596695/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are at a high risk of infection and sepsis. However, there are few studies on predicting secondary sepsis in TBI patients in the ICU. This study aimed to build a prediction model for the risk of secondary sepsis in TBI patients in the ICU, and provide effective information for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using the MIMIC IV database version 2.0 (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV), we searched data on TBI patients admitted to ICU and considered them as a study cohort. The extracted data included patient demographic information, laboratory indicators, complications, and other clinical data. The study cohort was divided into a training cohort and a validation cohort. In the training cohort, variables were screened by LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression and stepwise Logistic regression to assess the predictive ability of each feature on the incidence of patients. The screened variables were included in the final Logistic regression model. Finally, the decision curve, calibration curve, and receiver operating character (ROC) were used to test the performance of the model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Finally, a total of 1167 patients were included in the study, and these patients were randomly divided into the training (N = 817) and validation (N = 350) cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. In the training cohort, seven features were identified as key predictors of secondary sepsis in TBI patients in the ICU, including acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia, invasive ventilation, GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) score, lactic acid, and blood calcium level, which were included in the final model. The areas under the ROC curve in the training cohort and the validation cohort were 0.756 and 0.711, respectively. The calibration curve and ROC curve show that the model has favorable predictive accuracy, while the decision curve shows that the model has favorable clinical benefits with good and robust predictive efficiency.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We have developed a nomogram model for predicting secondary sepsis in TBI patients admitted to the ICU, which can provide useful predictive information for clinical decision-making."
Effect of Preoperative Beta-Blocker Use on Outcomes Following Cardiac Surgery.,"Jason B O'Neal, Frederic T Billings th, Xulei Liu, Matthew S Shotwell, Yafen Liang, Ashish S Shah, Jesse M Ehrenfeld, Jonathan P Wanderer, Andrew D Shaw, Jason B O'Nealet al.",2017 Oct 15,Am J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28826895/,No keywords found,"Recent studies suggest that the use of preoperative β blockers in cardiac surgery may not provide improved mortality rates and may even contribute to negative clinical outcomes. We therefore assessed the role of β blockers on several outcomes after cardiac surgery (delirium, acute kidney injury [AKI], stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), mortality, and hospital length of stay) in 4,076 patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary artery bypass grafting + valve, or valve cardiac surgery from November 1, 2009, to September 30, 2015, at Vanderbilt Medical Center. Clinical data from 2 prospectively collected datasets at our institution were reviewed: the Cardiac Surgery Perioperative Outcomes Database and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database. Preoperative β-blocker use was defined by Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines as patients receiving a β blocker within 24 hours preceding surgery. Of the included patients, 2,648 (65.0%) were administered a β blocker within 24 hours before surgery. Adjusting for possible confounders, preoperative β-blocker use was associated with increased odds of AKI stage 2 (odds ratio 1.96, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 3.24, p <0.01). There was no evidence that β-blocker use had an independent association with postoperative delirium, AKI stages 1 and 3, stroke, AF, mortality, or prolonged length of stay. A secondary propensity score analysis did not show a marginal association between β-blocker use and any outcome. In conclusion, we did not find significant evidence that preoperative β-blocker use was associated with postoperative delirium, AF, AKI, stroke, or mortality."

      Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The role of immediate coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after restoration of spontaneous circulation following cardiac arrest in the absence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains debated.
    


          Hypothesis:
        
      
      We hypothesize that immediate CAG and PCI, if indicated, will improve 90-day survival in post-cardiac arrest patients without signs of STEMI.
    


          Design:
        
      
      In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial, 552 post-cardiac arrest patients with restoration of spontaneous circulation and without signs of STEMI will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to immediate CAG and PCI (within 2 hours) versus initial deferral with CAG and PCI after neurological recovery. The primary end point of the study is 90-day survival. The secondary end points will include 90-day survival with good cerebral performance or minor/moderate disability, myocardial injury, duration of inotropic support, occurrence of acute kidney injury, need for renal replacement therapy, time to targeted temperature control, neurological status at intensive care unit discharge, markers of shock, recurrence of ventricular tachycardia, duration of mechanical ventilation, and reasons for discontinuation of treatment.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The COACT trial is a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study that will evaluate the effect of an immediate invasive coronary strategy in post-cardiac arrest patients without STEMI on 90-day survival."
Single-center outcomes of combined heart and liver transplantation in the failing Fontan.,"Benjamin A D'Souza, Stephanie Fuller, Lacey P Gleason, Nicole Hornsby, Joyce Wald, Karen Krok, Abraham Shaked, Lee R Goldberg, Alberto Pochettino, Kim M Olthoff, Yuli Y Kim, Benjamin A D'Souzaet al.",2017 Mar,Clin Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27988989/,"Fontan, combined heart and liver transplantation, congenital heart disease, liver cirrhosis, single ventricle.","Long-term outcomes of the Fontan operation include Fontan failure and liver disease. Combined heart-liver transplantation (CHLT) is an option for select patients although limited data exist on this strategy. A retrospective review of Fontan patients 18 years or older referred for cardiac transplant evaluation between 2000 and 2013 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania was performed. All patients were considered for potential CHLT. Clinical variables such as demographics, perioperative factors, and short-term outcomes were reviewed. Of 17 referrals for cardiac transplantation, seven Fontan patients underwent CHLT. All patients who underwent CHLT had either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis on liver biopsy. There were no perioperative deaths. The most common postoperative morbidity was acute kidney injury. Short-term complications include one episode of acute liver rejection but no cardiac rejection greater than 1R. CHLT is an acceptable therapeutic option for patients with failing Fontan physiology who exhibit concomitant advanced liver fibrosis. However, optimal patient selection is currently undefined, and long-term outcomes are not known."

      One of the important factors in the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among renal transplant patients (RTPs) is ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). The current study aimed at determining the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of melatonin on the complications of IRI and the level of Klotho expression in these patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 40 renal transplant candidates were randomly assigned into placebo or melatonin group receiving the same dose of 3 mg/day. In order to measure serum melatonin levels, inflammatory and oxidative stress factors, renal function biomarkers, and Klotho gene/protein expression, venous blood samples were taken from patients over two different time points, i e, 24 h before the transplantation and at discharge from hospital.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Melatonin was associated with improvement in renal transplantation, since the serum level of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, as a renal functional marker, significantly decreased (P < .001). The effect of melatonin as a suppressor of inflammation and oxidative stress was also evident in the melatonin group due to a significant reduction in the serum levels of MDA, CP, 8-OHdG, and TNF-α markers (P < .001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Reduction in serum levels of renal function and oxidative stress/inflammatory markers in the melatonin group indicates that melatonin can inhibit IRI outcomes in RTPs through its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, these properties do not appear as a result of influence on the level of Klotho gene/protein expression."
The Effects of Angiotensin II versus Norepinephrine on Pulmonary Vascular Resistance in Cardiac Surgery: Post Hoc Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Jolene Lim, Kathy Zhang, Lachlan Miles, Rinaldo Bellomo, Tim G Coulson, Jolene Limet al.",2024 Dec,J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39489662/,No keywords found,"Objectives:

          Participants:

      Angiotensin II infusion compared with norepinephrine infusion.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of PVR both intraoperatively and postoperatively between the angiotensin II group and the norepinephrine group. The study drug (angiotensin II or norepinephrine) infusion rate was associated with a small increase in PVR (β = 0.08; p = 0.01). The strongest association with PVR was the random effect (ie, patient effect) (p < 0.001). This effect was consistent across secondary outcomes. Randomization to norepinephrine instead of to angiotensin II was associated with reduced mean systemic arterial to mean pulmonary arterial pressure ratio postoperatively (β = -0.65; p = 0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results of this study suggest that in cardiac surgery patients and at doses used in the prior feasibility study, angiotensin II did not have significant effects on the pulmonary vasculature compared with norepinephrine. Moreover, at doses used in this study, neither drug appeared to have a substantial effect on the pulmonary circulation relative to surgical and patient factors."
The utility of repeat kidney biopsy in systemic immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis.,"Avital Angel-Korman, Aala Jaberi, Vaishali Sanchorawala, Andrea Havasi, Avital Angel-Kormanet al.",2020 Mar,Amyloid,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31595786/,"AL amyloidosis, Systemic light chain amyloidosis, kidney biopsy, renal amyloidosis, repeat biopsy.","Background: The diagnostic utility of repeat kidney biopsy in AL amyloidosis patients in complete (CR) or very good partial hematologic response (VGPR) but with renal organ relapse is not clear.Methods: We present eight patients with AL amyloidosis who had a repeat kidney biopsy performed.Results: AL amyloidosis was initially diagnosed by a kidney biopsy. All patients had a favorable response to treatment (CR/VGPR) and five of them also had initially a renal organ response. A repeat kidney biopsy was done due to gradual deterioration of kidney function and/or proteinuria while maintaining a hematologic response. Repeat kidney biopsies showed findings consistent with amyloid deposits in all patients. Seven patients had renal progression with four of them requiring dialysis initiation. Only one patient had a favorable renal outcome. This patient had subacute kidney injury with decreasing proteinuria and was found to have granulomatous interstitial nephritis in addition to amyloid deposits and responded well to steroid treatment with rapid improvement in renal function.Conclusions: In AL amyloidosis patients who achieve a favorable hematologic response to treatment (CR/VGPR) but subsequently develop worsening renal insufficiency or proteinuria, a repeat kidney biopsy should generally not be performed. Amyloid deposits persist in the kidneys even after successful hematologic treatment and it is impossible to differentiate between new versus old amyloid deposits, which makes performing a repeat kidney biopsy unnecessary in most cases. Demonstration of amyloid deposits on repeat kidney biopsy would not aid in the decision making regarding re-initiation of hematologic treatment. A kidney biopsy should be considered only in cases when a specific alternative diagnosis is suspected."

      Liver cirrhosis is a major healthcare problem and the mortality rate is high. During recent years, systemic inflammation has been recognized as a major driver of hepatic decompensation and progression of liver cirrhosis to acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). The aim of the CYTOHEP study is to assess the impact of extracorporeal hemoadsorption with the CytoSorb adsorber on serum bilirubin concentrations, humoral inflammation parameters, liver function parameters, and patient survival in patients with ACLF and acute kidney injury (AKI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The CYTOHEP study is a prospective, single-center, open-label, three-arm, randomized, controlled intervention trial. Patients with ACLF and AKI stage 3 according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria will be randomized into three groups to be treated with (1) continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and CytoSorb, (2) CRRT without CytoSorb, and (3) without both, CRRT and CytoSorb. In the hemoadsorption group, CytoSorb will be used for 72 h. The other groups receive standard of care with early or late initiation of CRRT, respectively. Primary endpoint of the study is serum bilirubin concentration after 72 h, important secondary endpoints are 30-day survival and a panel of inflammatory parameters.

Empagliflozin to prevent post-operative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Rationale and design of the EMPOAF trial.,"Maryam Aghakouchakzadeh, Kaveh Hosseini, Majid Haghjoo, Parastoo Mirzabeigi, Masih Tajdini, Azita H Talasaz, Arash Jalali, Amir Askarinejad, Erfan Kohansal, Behnam Hedayat, Ehsan Parvas, Ali Bozorgi, Jamshid Bagheri, Nader Givtaj, Naser Hadavand, Alireza Hajighasemi, Seyed Hossein Ahmadi Tafti, Saeid Hosseini, Parham Sadeghipour, Hessam Kakavand, Maryam Aghakouchakzadehet al.",2024 Aug,Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38946138/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is one of the most common types of acute AF and can complicate the treatment course of approximately one third of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are among the newest antidiabetic drugs which can be therapeutic options for preventing POAF by different mechanisms.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Empagliflozin to Prevent POAF (EMPOAF) is an interventional, investigator-initiated, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized controlled trial which will be conducted in two referral teaching cardiology hospitals in Tehran. Four-hundred ninety-two adult patients who are scheduled for elective isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery will be randomly assigned to one of the groups of intervention (empagliflozin 10 mg daily) or placebo starting at least 3 days before surgery until discharge. Key exclusion criteria are a history of diabetes mellitus, AF, ketoacidosis, or recurrent urinary tract infections along with severe renal or hepatic impairment, unstable hemodynamics, and patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors for another indication. The primary outcome will be the incidence of POAF. Key secondary endpoints will be the composite rate of life-threatening arrhythmias, postoperative acute kidney injury, hospitalization length, in-hospital mortality, stroke, and systemic embolization. Key safety endpoints will be the rate of life-threatening and/or genitourinary tract infections, hypoglycemia, and ketoacidosis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      EMPOAF will prospectively evaluate whether empagliflozin 10 mg daily can reduce the rate of POAF in patients undergoing elective CABG. Enrolment into this study has started by November 2023 and is expected to be ended before the end of 2025."

      A total of 120 CKD patients who received kidney plain scan plus enhanced examination in the CT room of the Medical Imaging Department of our hospital from June 2019 to September 2019 were selected and randomly divided into the experimental group (n = 60) and the control group (n = 60). Patients in the control group received the conventional CT plain scan and enhanced scan, and for patients in the experimental group, CT plain scan was performed first, the range of 640-slice CT dynamic volume scan was determined, and after bolus injection of contrast agent, dynamic volume scan was performed for scanning in the cortical phase, myeloid phase, and secretory phase. The imaging quality and effective scanning dose were compared between the two modalities, and the relationship between CT values obtained from 640-slice CT scan and conventional CT scan and the renal impairment was analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared with the control group, the image quality of 640-slice CT scan conducted in the experimental group was significantly better (P < 0.05); the effective radiation doses of the experimental group and the control group were, respectively, (1.89 ± 0.32) mSv and (3.26 ± 0.47) mSv, indicating that the dose was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (t = 18.664, P < 0.001), and the correlation analysis showed that the relationship between the sum of CT values in the cortical phase of both kidneys and kidney injury in the experimental group was r = 0.835, P < 0.001.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Both 640-slice CT kidney scan and conventional CT scan can be used in the diagnosis of CKD. 640-slice CT has a lower radiation dose, better image quality, and higher application value."
A Bayesian reanalysis of the Standard versus Accelerated Initiation of Renal-Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury (STARRT-AKI) trial.,"Fernando G Zampieri, Bruno R da Costa, Suvi T Vaara, François Lamontagne, Bram Rochwerg, Alistair D Nichol, Shay McGuinness, Danny F McAuley, Marlies Ostermann, Ron Wald, Sean M Bagshaw                              ;, STARRT-AKI Investigators, Fernando G Zampieriet al.",2022 Aug 25,Crit Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36008827/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Timing of initiation of kidney-replacement therapy (KRT) in critically ill patients remains controversial. The Standard versus Accelerated Initiation of Renal-Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury (STARRT-AKI) trial compared two strategies of KRT initiation (accelerated versus standard) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and found neutral results for 90-day all-cause mortality. Probabilistic exploration of the trial endpoints may enable greater understanding of the trial findings. We aimed to perform a reanalysis using a Bayesian framework.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a secondary analysis of all 2927 patients randomized in multi-national STARRT-AKI trial, performed at 168 centers in 15 countries. The primary endpoint, 90-day all-cause mortality, was evaluated using hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression. A spectrum of priors includes optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic priors, along with priors informed from earlier clinical trials. Secondary endpoints (KRT-free days and hospital-free days) were assessed using zero-one inflated beta regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The posterior probability of benefit comparing an accelerated versus a standard KRT initiation strategy for the primary endpoint suggested no important difference, regardless of the prior used (absolute difference of 0.13% [95% credible interval [CrI] - 3.30%; 3.40%], - 0.39% [95% CrI - 3.46%; 3.00%], and 0.64% [95% CrI - 2.53%; 3.88%] for neutral, optimistic, and pessimistic priors, respectively). There was a very low probability that the effect size was equal or larger than a consensus-defined minimal clinically important difference. Patients allocated to the accelerated strategy had a lower number of KRT-free days (median absolute difference of - 3.55 days [95% CrI - 6.38; - 0.48]), with a probability that the accelerated strategy was associated with more KRT-free days of 0.008. Hospital-free days were similar between strategies, with the accelerated strategy having a median absolute difference of 0.48 more hospital-free days (95% CrI - 1.87; 2.72) compared with the standard strategy and the probability that the accelerated strategy had more hospital-free days was 0.66.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In a Bayesian reanalysis of the STARRT-AKI trial, we found very low probability that an accelerated strategy has clinically important benefits compared with the standard strategy. Patients receiving the accelerated strategy probably have fewer days alive and KRT-free. These findings do not support the adoption of an accelerated strategy of KRT initiation."

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel theranostic agent, 177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Thirty-one mCRPC patients with progressive disease despite second-line hormonal therapy and/or docetaxel chemotherapy were recruited for the study. All patients underwent diagnostic68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CCPET/CT, prior to inclusion for therapy. Included patients then underwent quarterly 177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy. Hematological, kidney function, liver function tests, and serum PSA levels were recorded before and after therapy at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 month intervals. Biochemical response was assessed with trend in serum PSA levels. Metabolic response was assessed by PERCIST 1 criteria. Clinical response was assessed by visual analogue score (VASmax) analgesic score (AS), Karanofsky performance status (KPS), and ttoxicity and response criteria of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean age of patients was 65.93 ± 9.77 years (range: 38-81 years). The mean activity administered in the 31 patients was 5069 ± 1845 MBq ranging from one to four cycles. There was a decline in the mean serum PSA levels from the baseline (baseline: 275 ng/mL, post 1st cycle therapy: 141.75 ng/mL). Based on biochemical response criteria 2/31, 20/31, 3/31, and 6/31 had complete response (CR), partial response(PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD), respectively. Metabolic response revealed 2/6 patients with CR, and the remaining 3/6 patients with PR and 1/6 patients with SD. The mean VASmax score decreased from 7.5 to 3. The mean analgesic score decreased from 2.5 to 1.8 after therapy. The mean KPS score improved from 50.32 to 65.42 after therapies. The mean ECOG performance status improved from 2.54 to 1.78 after therapy. Two patients experienced grade I and grade II hemoglobin toxicity each. None of the patients experienced nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity.
    


          Conclusion:
        
177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 radionuclide therapy is a safe and effective approach in the treatment of mCRPC patients."
The role of cystatin C in the prognosis of adverse outcomes after the coronary artery bypass graft surgery during hospitalisation.,"Kristina S Shafranskaya, Vasiliy V Kashtalap, Olga V Gruzdeva, Anton G Kutikhin, Olga L Barbarash, Leonid S Barbarash, Kristina S Shafranskayaet al.",2015 Feb,Heart Lung Circ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25194959/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      This study has been aimed to assess clinical significance of cystatin C in the prognosis of a risk of hospital complications among the patients with coronary artery disease CAD who have undergone coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We have recruited 719 consecutive Caucasian (Russian) patients who underwent CABG in 2011-2012.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No statistically significant differences in the serum creatinine concentration (sCr) and glomerular filtration rate before and seven days after the surgery have been found among the patients belonging to different EuroSCORE risk groups. A statistically significant elevation of serum cystatin C concentration (sCC) before and seven days after the surgery has been demonstrated in EuroSCORE medium- and high-risk groups in comparison with the low-risk group. In addition, we have revealed increased pre-surgical levels of sCC in patients who had died earlier than seven days after CABG. Regarding the cardiovascular complications, a statistically significant elevation of sCC has been observed in patients with and without myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or acute kidney injury (AKI) in the postoperative period.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We suggest that the determination of sCC before and after CABG surgery may help in the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes after the CABG surgery."
Cerebral Embolic Protection during Transcatheter Aortic-Valve Replacement.,"Samir R Kapadia, Raj Makkar, Martin Leon, Mohamed Abdel-Wahab, Thomas Waggoner, Steffen Massberg, Wolfgang Rottbauer, Samuel Horr, Lars Sondergaard, Juhana Karha, Robert Gooley, Lowell Satler, Robert C Stoler, Steven R Messé, Suzanne J Baron, Julia Seeger, Susheel Kodali, Amar Krishnaswamy, Vinod H Thourani, Katherine Harrington, Stuart Pocock, Rodrigo Modolo, Dominic J Allocco, Ian T Meredith, Axel Linke                              ;, PROTECTED TAVR Investigators, Samir R Kapadiaet al.",2022 Oct 6,N Engl J Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36121045/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) for the treatment of aortic stenosis can lead to embolization of debris. Capture of debris by devices that provide cerebral embolic protection (CEP) may reduce the risk of stroke.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We randomly assigned patients with aortic stenosis in a 1:1 ratio to undergo transfemoral TAVR with CEP (CEP group) or without CEP (control group). The primary end point was stroke within 72 hours after TAVR or before discharge (whichever came first) in the intention-to-treat population. Disabling stroke, death, transient ischemic attack, delirium, major or minor vascular complications at the CEP access site, and acute kidney injury were also assessed. A neurology professional examined all the patients at baseline and after TAVR.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 3000 patients across North America, Europe, and Australia underwent randomization; 1501 were assigned to the CEP group and 1499 to the control group. A CEP device was successfully deployed in 1406 of the 1489 patients (94.4%) in whom an attempt was made. The incidence of stroke within 72 hours after TAVR or before discharge did not differ significantly between the CEP group and the control group (2.3% vs. 2.9%; difference, -0.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.7 to 0.5; P = 0.30). Disabling stroke occurred in 0.5% of the patients in the CEP group and in 1.3% of those in the control group. There were no substantial differences between the CEP group and the control group in the percentage of patients who died (0.5% vs. 0.3%); had a stroke, a transient ischemic attack, or delirium (3.1% vs. 3.7%); or had acute kidney injury (0.5% vs. 0.5%). One patient (0.1%) had a vascular complication at the CEP access site.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVR, the use of CEP did not have a significant effect on the incidence of periprocedural stroke, but on the basis of the 95% confidence interval around this outcome, the results may not rule out a benefit of CEP during TAVR.

"Remote ischaemic preconditioning does not modulate the systemic inflammatory response or renal tubular stress biomarkers after endotoxaemia in healthy human volunteers: a single-centre, mechanistic, randomised controlled trial.","J Zwaag, R Beunders, M C Warlé, J A Kellum, N P Riksen, P Pickkers, M Kox, J Zwaaget al.",2019 Aug,Br J Anaesth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31084985/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) consists of repeated cycles of limb ischaemia and reperfusion, which may reduce perioperative myocardial ischaemic damage and kidney injury. We hypothesised that RIPC may be beneficial by attenuating the systemic inflammatory response. We investigated whether RIPC affects the response in humans to bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) by measuring plasma cytokines and renal cell-cycle arrest mediators, which reflect renal tubular stress.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Healthy male volunteers were randomised to receive either daily RIPC for 6 consecutive days (RIPCmultiple, n=10) plus RIPC during the 40 min preceding i.v. LPS (2 ng kg-1), RIPC only during the 40 min before LPS (RIPCsingle, n=10), or no RIPC preceding LPS (control, n=10). As a surrogate marker of renal tubular stress, the product of urinary concentrations of two cell-cycle arrest markers was calculated (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 [TIMP2]*insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 [IGFBP7]). Data are presented as median (inter-quartile range).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In both RIPC groups, RIPC alone increased [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7]. LPS administration resulted in fever, flu-like symptoms, and haemodynamic alterations. Plasma cytokine concentrations increased profoundly during endotoxaemia (control group: tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] from 14 [9-16] pg ml-1 at baseline to 480 [284-709] pg ml-1 at 1.5 h after LPS; interleukin-6 [IL-6] from 4 [4-4] pg ml-1 at baseline to 659 [505-1018] pg ml-1 at 2 h after LPS). LPS administration also increased urinary [TIMP2[*[IGFBP7]. RIPC had no effect on LPS-induced cytokine release or [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7].
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RIPC neither modulated systemic cytokine release nor attenuated inflammation-induced tubular stress after LPS. However, RIPC alone induced renal markers of cell-cycle arrest.

Blood Pressure Variability Predicts Adverse Events and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease: A Post-Hoc Analysis of the SPRINT Trial.,"Kenechukwu Mezue, Abhinav Goyal, Gregg S Pressman, Jay C Horrow, Janani Rangaswami, Kenechukwu Mezueet al.",2017 Dec 8,Am J Hypertens,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28985328/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Visit-to-visit blood pressure variability has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Using the SPRINT trial data set, we explored the relationship between blood pressure variability, cardiovascular outcomes, and hypoperfusion-related adverse events of antihypertensive therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) enrolled in the study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The analyses included patients with CKD randomized in SPRINT who reached the target systolic blood pressure for their respective groups (intensive <120 mm Hg; standard <140 mm Hg). Coefficients of variation (CV) for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for each subject characterized variability. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent predictors of the SPRINT primary outcome (including acute coronary syndrome, stroke, acute heart failure, and death from cardiovascular causes) and the 3 major side effects of therapy-hypotension, syncope, and acute kidney injury (AKI). P <0.15 on univariate analysis was required to enter the model, and P <0.05 to remain in it.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 2,488 subjects (1,273 standard; 1,124 intensive) met inclusion criteria. DBP CV predicted a greater hazard for primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 1.126, P < 0.0001) in the overall model as well as in separate analyses by treatment arms (standard group HR 1.107, P < 0.0001; intensive group HR 1.100, P = 0.0004). DBP CV also independently predicted a greater hazard for AKI (HR 1.117), syncope (HR 1.111), and hypotensive events (HR 1.104).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Visit-to-visit DBP variability independently predicts worse cardiovascular outcomes and hypoperfusion-related adverse events in patients with CKD enrolled in SPRINT."
Comparison of the Transarterial and Transthoracic Approaches in Nontransfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"Mathurin Beve, Vincent Auffret, Reda Belhaj Soulami, Jacques Tomasi, Amedeo Anselmi, Antoine Roisne, Dominique Boulmier, Marc Bedossa, Guillaume Leurent, Erwan Donal, Hervé Le Breton, Jean-Philippe Verhoye, Mathurin Beveet al.",2019 May 1,Am J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30777318/,No keywords found,"Transfemoral approach stands as the reference access-route for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Nonetheless, alternatives approaches are still needed in a significant proportion of patients. This study aimed at comparing outcomes between transthoracic-approach (transapical or transaortic) and transarterial-approach (transcarotid or subclavian) TAVI. Data from 191 consecutive patients who underwent surgical-approach TAVI from May 2009 to September 2017 were analyzed. Patients were allocated in 2 groups according to the approach. The primary end point was the 30-day composite of death of any cause, need for open surgery, tamponade, stroke, major or life-threatening bleeding, stage 2 or 3 acute kidney injury, coronary obstruction, or major vascular complications. During the study period, 104 patients underwent transthoracic TAVI (transapical: 60.6%, transaortic: 39.4%) whereas 87 patients underwent transarterial TAVI (subclavian: 83.9%, transcarotid: 16.1%). Logistic EuroSCORE I tended to be higher in transthoracic-TAVI recipients. In-hospital and 30-day composite end point rates were 25.0% and 11.5% (p = 0.025), and 26.0% and 14.9% (p = 0.075) for the transthoracic and transarterial cohorts, respectively. Propensity score-adjusted logistic regression demonstrated no significant detrimental association between the 30-day composite end point and transthoracic access (odds ratio 2.12 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 6.42; p = 0.18). Transarterial TAVI was associated with a shorter length of stay (median: 6 vs 7 days, p <0.001). TAVI approach was not an independent predictor of midterm mortality. In conclusion, nontransfemoral transarterial-approach TAVI is safe, feasible, and associated with comparable rates of major perioperative complications, and midterm mortality compared with transthoracic-approach TAVI."
"Evaluation of Safety, Biodistribution, and Dosimetry of a Long-Acting Radiolabeled Somatostatin Analog 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE With and Without Amino Acid Infusion.","Yuanyuan Jiang, Qingxing Liu, Guochang Wang, Jingjing Zhang, Zhaohui Zhu, Xiaoyuan Chen, Yuanyuan Jianget al.",2023 Jun 1,Clin Nucl Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37075254/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Kidney is considered to be one of the dose-limiting organs in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Amino acid cocktail infusion has been applied to reduce renal absorbed dose by inhibiting the proximal tubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. An Evans blue-modified 177 Lu-labeled octreotate ( 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE) has an extended circulation in the blood, which may make the amino acid infusion unnecessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, biodistribution, and dosimetry of 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE with and without amino acid infusion.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Ten patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors were randomly divided into 2 groups. The effect of amino acid infusion on renal uptake was assessed in a crossover randomized setting. Group A received 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE at a dose of 3.7 GBq without amino acid infusion for the first cycle and with amino acid infusion for the second cycle; group B received 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE at a dose of 3.7 GBq with amino acid infusion for the first cycle and without amino acid infusion for the second cycle. All patients underwent serial whole-body planar imaging at 1, 24, 96, and 168 hours and SPECT scan at 24 hours after radioligand administration. Abdominal CT was performed 2 days before PRRT for SPECT/CT fusion. The dosimetry was calculated using the HERMES software. Dosimetry evaluation was compared on a between-group and intrapatient basis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Administrations of 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE with or without amino acids were well tolerated. No grade 4 hematotoxicity was observed in any of the patients. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was reported in 1 patient. No nephrotoxicity of any grade was recorded. No significant difference was observed in creatinine (75.1 ± 21.7 vs 67.5 ± 18.1 μmol/L, P = 0.128), blood urea nitrogen (4.5 ± 0.8 vs 5.1 ± 1.4 mmol/L, P = 0.612), or GFR (109.3 ± 25.2 vs 100.9 ± 24.9 mL/min, P = 0.398) before and after PRRT. For each cycle, there was no significant difference in whole-body effective dose, kidney effective dose, as well as residence time of the kidneys between group A and B ( P > 0.05). By intrapatient comparison, without and with amino acid infusion also did not show significant difference in whole-body effective dose (0.14 ± 0.05 vs 0.12 ± 0.04 mSv/MBq, P = 0.612), kidney effective dose (1.09 ± 0.42 vs 0.73 ± 0.31 mSv/MBq, P = 0.093), and residence time of the kidneys (2.95 ± 1.58 vs 3.13 ± 1.11 hours, P = 0.674).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE PRRT with and without amino acid infusion demonstrated a favorable safety profile in neuroendocrine tumor patients. Administration of 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE without amino acid infusion has acceptable slightly increased kidney absorbed dose and residence time of the kidneys, and does not affect kidney function. Further investigation in a larger cohort and long-term follow-up are warranted."
Prognostic value of intraoperative measurements of renal tissue oxygenation and microcirculation on renal function in partial nephrectomy.,"Matthias Maruschke, Katja Hagel, Oliver Hakenberg, Thomas Scheeren, Matthias Maruschkeet al.",2018 Jun,Clin Exp Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29197972/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Partial nephrectomy (PNx) can be associated with macrocirculatory and microcirculatory alterations, ultimately leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). Measuring kidney tissue oxygenation (μHbO2) and microcirculation during open PNx might be feasible to early detect these alterations and prevent postoperative AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      μHbO2 and microcirculation were measured in 45 patients undergoing PNx by reflectance spectrophotometry and laser Doppler flowmetry (O2C™, Lea, Germany), related to ischemia time and tumour size. Pre- and postoperative creatinine levels were determined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      μHbO2 was lower after reperfusion than before clamping (72 vs. 75%), while microcirculation and regional haemoglobin did not differ. Ischemia time was 15.7 min on average. μHbO2 was higher without ischemia (80 vs. 70%, p = 0.109) and in T1a- than T1b-tumours, independent of ischemia time and reperfusion. The renal collecting system (RCS) was opened in 19/45 patients with μHbO2 of 68% after reperfusion compared to 74% with intact RCS. Postoperative complications occurred in 6/45 patients (13%). μHbO2 was 68% before clamping vs. 75% without complications. Serum creatinine of patients with T1b was higher compared to T1a (103 vs. 87 µmol/L). Patients with larger tumours had higher postoperative creatinine levels (173 vs. 124 µmol/L; p = 0.052).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We showed for the first time that the method is feasible to monitor renal tissue oxygenation at the level of microcirculation non-invasively and reproducibly during PNx. Tumour size seems to have a decisive influence on oxygenation and postoperative renal function. Our results imply that postoperative complications may be predicted by low intraoperative renal oxygenation and microcirculatory flow measurements."
Kidney Pathology after Hematologic Cell Transplantation-A Single-Center Observation Study of Indication Biopsies and Autopsies.,"Michael Girsberger, Jörg P Halter, Helmut Hopfer, Michael Dickenmann, Thomas Menter, Michael Girsbergeret al.",2018 Mar,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29155318/,"GVHD, Hematopoietic cell transplantation, Kidney biopsy, Thrombotic microangiopathy.","Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an increasingly used treatment for hematologic malignancies as well as for nonmalignant diseases. Kidney impairment remains an important early and late post-transplantation complication. Although numerous histopathological changes have been reported, the pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, correlations between clinical findings and morphological changes have not been well studied. Between 2000 and 2016, 17 recipients of allogeneic (n = 12) or autologous (n = 5) HCT underwent kidney biopsy for either proteinuria or deterioration of kidney function at our center. The most common biopsy findings were therapy-related changes with thrombotic microangiopathy (n = 5), calcineurin inhibitor toxicity (n = 4), and membranous glomerulonephritis (n = 3), representing the majority of cases in this category. In addition, kidney findings from 137 autopsies performed between 1995 and March 2017 were analyzed. The most common changes were acute kidney injury (n = 55), most likely due to the patients' premortal deteriorated state, and thrombotic microangiopathy (n = 14). Several cases demonstrated involvement by either infectious agents (n = 6) or tumors (n = 9). Distinct kidney diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, were rare (3% of cases). Uncommon and yet rarely described diagnoses for this patient cohort were IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis and fibrillary nephritis. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the histomorphological findings in kidney biopsy specimens from HCT recipients. Along with treatment-related complications, one putative correlate of chronic GVHD of the kidney could be documented: membranous glomerulonephritis. In contrast, no morphological correlate of acute GVHD of the kidney was identified. Findings at the time of autopsy varied greatly, spanning a wider range than those of indication biopsies."

      In continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)-treated patients, a net ultrafiltration (NUF) rate >1.75 mL/kg/h has been associated with increased mortality. However, there may be heterogeneity of effect of NUF rate on mortality, according to patient characteristics.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To investigate the presence and impact of heterogeneity of effect, we performed a secondary analysis of the ""Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level of Renal Replacement Therapy"" (RENAL) trial. Exposure was NUF rate (weight-adjusted fluid volume removed per hour) stratified into tertiles (<1.01 mL/kg/h; 1.01-1.75 mL/kg/h; or >1.75 mL/kg/h). Primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Patients were clustered according to baseline characteristics. Heterogeneity of effect was assessed according to clusters and baseline edema and related to the additional impact of baseline cardiovascular Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. We excluded patients with missing values for baseline weight and/or treatment duration.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 2 clusters. The largest (cluster 1; n = 941) included more severely ill patients, with more sepsis, more edema, and more vasopressor therapy (all p < 0.001). Compared to the middle tertile, the probability of harm was greater with the high tertile of NUF rate in patients in cluster 1 and in patients with baseline edema (probability of harm, cluster 1: 99.9%; edema: 99.1%). Moreover, higher baseline cardiovascular SOFA score also increased mortality risk with both high and low compared to middle NUF rates in cluster 1 patients and in patients with edema.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In CRRT patients, both high and low NUF rates may be harmful, especially in those with edema, sepsis, and greater illness severity. Cardiovascular SOFA scores modulate this association. Additional studies are needed to test these hypotheses, and targeted trials of NUF rates based on risk stratification appear justified.

Early Clinical Predictors of Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome after Myeloablative Stem Cell Transplantation.,"Lindsey E Roeker, Haesook T Kim, Brett Glotzbecker, Prashant Nageshwar, Sarah Nikiforow, John Koreth, Philippe Armand, Corey Cutler, Edwin P Alyea, Joseph H Antin, Paul G Richardson, Robert J Soiffer, Vincent T Ho, Lindsey E Roekeret al.",2019 Jan,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30081073/,"Defibrotide, SOS, Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, Tacrolimus, VOD, Veno-occlusive disease.","Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), is a serious complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with mortality in its severe form exceeding 80%. Although the incidence of VOD/SOS has fallen with contemporary transplantation practices, the increasing use of inotuzumab, the return of gemtuzumab, and the popularity of pharmacokinetic-guided high-dose busulfan may impact incidence. Early intervention with defibrotide improves survival, but prompt diagnosis can be difficult. We aimed to identify clinical parameters that could aid in early detection of VOD/SOS in a large, retrospective, cohort study. Of the 1823 adult patients who underwent myeloablative HSCT between 1996 and 2015 in our center, 205 (11%) developed VOD/SOS, with a median onset of day +14. We compared parameters in the 7 days preceding VOD/SOS onset for cases to 447 randomly selected control subjects in an analogous time frame to determine those with predictive value. Between 7 days before and the day of diagnosis, VOD/SOS patients had higher serum creatinine levels and were more likely to develop acute kidney injury (61% versus 33%, P < .0001), more commonly experienced refractoriness to platelet transfusion (48% versus 24%, P < .0001), and had higher trough serum tacrolimus levels (7 days before VOD/SOS onset: median 8.8 versus 7.3, P = .0002; day of onset: median 9.3 versus 7.2, P < .0001) compared with control subjects. Acute renal dysfunction, platelet refractoriness, and elevated or abnormal tacrolimus levels are dynamic clinical markers that should alert clinicians to the development of VOD/SOS before the presence of classical diagnostic criteria. Using these clinical features to recognize VOD/SOS earlier in its clinical course could promote earlier treatment and lead to improved outcomes of this potentially serious complication."
Early High-Volume Hemofiltration versus Standard Care for Post-Cardiac Surgery Shock. The HEROICS Study.,"Alain Combes, Nicolas Bréchot, Julien Amour, Nathalie Cozic, Guillaume Lebreton, Catherine Guidon, Elie Zogheib, Jean-Claude Thiranos, Jean-Christophe Rigal, Olivier Bastien, Hamina Benhaoua, Bernard Abry, Alexandre Ouattara, Jean-Louis Trouillet, Alain Mallet, Jean Chastre, Pascal Leprince, Charles-Edouard Luyt, Alain Combeset al.",2015 Nov 15,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26167637/,No keywords found,"Rationale:
        
      
      Post-cardiac surgery shock is associated with high morbidity and mortality. By removing toxins and proinflammatory mediators and correcting metabolic acidosis, high-volume hemofiltration (HVHF) might halt the vicious circle leading to death by improving myocardial performance and reducing vasopressor dependence.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To determine whether early HVHF decreases all-cause mortality 30 days after randomization.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trial included patients with severe shock requiring high-dose catecholamines 3-24 hours post-cardiac surgery who were randomized to early HVHF (80 ml/kg/h for 48 h), followed by standard-volume continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) until resolution of shock and recovery of renal function, or conservative standard care, with delayed CVVHDF only for persistent, severe acute kidney injury.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      On Day 30, 40 of 112 (36%) HVHF and 40 of 112 (36%) control subjects (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.56; P = 1.00) had died; only 57% of the control subjects had received renal-replacement therapy. Between-group survivors' Day-60, Day-90, intensive care unit, and in-hospital mortality rates, Day-30 ventilator-free days, and renal function recovery were comparable. HVHF patients experienced faster correction of metabolic acidosis and tended to be more rapidly weaned off catecholamines but had more frequent hypophosphatemia, metabolic alkalosis, and thrombocytopenia.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      For patients with post-cardiac surgery shock requiring high-dose catecholamines, the early HVHF onset for 48 hours, followed by standard volume until resolution of shock and recovery of renal function, did not lower Day-30 mortality and did not impact other important patient-centered outcomes compared with a conservative strategy with delayed CVVHDF initiation only for patients with persistent, severe acute kidney injury.

"Design and rationale of the ATHENA study--A 12-month, multicentre, prospective study evaluating the outcomes of a de novo everolimus-based regimen in combination with reduced cyclosporine or tacrolimus versus a standard regimen in kidney transplant patients: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.","Claudia Sommerer, Barbara Suwelack, Duska Dragun, Peter Schenker, Ingeborg A Hauser, Björn Nashan, Friedrich Thaiss, Claudia Sommereret al.",2016 Feb 17:17:92.,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26888217/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors remains the mainstay of treatment after kidney transplantation; however, long-term use of these drugs may be associated with nephrotoxicity. In this regard, the current approach is to optimise available immunosuppressive regimens to reduce the calcineurin inhibitor dose while protecting renal function without affecting the efficacy. The ATHENA study is designed to evaluate renal function in two regimens: an everolimus and reduced calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen versus a standard treatment protocol with mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus in de novo kidney transplant recipients.
    


          Method/design:
        
      
      ATHENA is a 12-month, multicentre, open-label, prospective, randomised, parallel-group study in de novo kidney transplant recipients (aged 18 years or older) receiving renal allografts from deceased or living donors. Eligible patients are randomised (1:1:1) prior to transplantation to one of the following three treatment arms: everolimus (starting dose 1.5 mg/day; C0 3-8 ng/mL) with cyclosporine or everolimus (starting dose 3 mg/day; C0 3-8 ng/mL) with tacrolimus or mycophenolic acid (enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium at 1.44 g/day or mycophenolate mofetil at 2 g/day) with tacrolimus; in combination with corticosteroids. All patients receive induction therapy with basiliximab. The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of renal function (eGFR by the Nankivell formula) in one of the everolimus arms compared with the standard group at month 12 post transplantation. The key secondary objective is to assess the incidence of treatment failure, defined as biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death, among the treatment groups. Other objectives include assessment of the individual components of treatment failure, incidence and severity of viral infections, incidence and duration of delayed graft function, incidence of indication biopsies, slow graft function and wound healing complications, and overall safety and tolerability. Exploratory objectives include evaluation of left ventricular hypertrophy assessed by the left ventricular mass index, evolution of human leukocyte antigen and non-human leukocyte antigen antibodies, and a cytomegalovirus substudy.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      As one of the largest European multicentre kidney transplant studies, ATHENA will determine whether a de novo everolimus-based regimen can preserve renal function versus the standard of care. This study further assesses a number of clinical issues which impact long-term outcomes post transplantation; hence, its results will have a major clinical impact.

Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Prior Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.,"John V Conte, Thomas G Gleason, Jon R Resar, David H Adams, G Michael Deeb, Jeffrey J Popma, G Chad Hughes, George L Zorn, Michael J Reardon, John V Conteet al.",2016 Jan,Ann Thorac Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26433523/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are treatment options for aortic stenosis in patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We assessed the major clinical outcomes of such patients enrolled in the CoreValve High Risk (CHR) study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Of the 795 CHR study patients, 226 had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery; 115 underwent TAVR and 111 underwent SAVR. The primary endpoint was a comparison of all-cause mortality at 1 year. Important secondary clinical endpoints were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 9.6% for TAVR versus 18.1% for SAVR (p = 0.06); cardiovascular mortality was 7.0% for TAVR versus 13.8% for SAVR (p = 0.09). A combination of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score greater than 7 and age greater than 80 years was a significant predictor of mortality, with TAVR demonstrating a survival advantage (p = 0.03). No differences were seen for stroke. The SAVR group had longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, increased incidence of acute kidney injury, life-threatening or disabling bleeding, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (p < 0.05). Pacemaker implantation and paravalvular regurgitation were greater with TAVR at all timepoints.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      For patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery and aortic stenosis, TAVR offers a significant morbidity advantage and a strong trend toward improved survival over SAVR at 1 year."
Platelet number and graft function predict intensive care survival in allogeneic stem cell transplantation patients.,"Amin T Turki, Wolfgang Lamm, Christoph Schmitt, Evren Bayraktar, Ferras Alashkar, Martin Metzenmacher, Philipp Wohlfarth, Dietrich W Beelen, Tobias Liebregts, Amin T Turkiet al.",2019 Feb,Ann Hematol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30406350/,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation, Anemia, Complications, Graft function, Intensive care treatment, Platelets, Thrombocytopenia.","Despite significant advances in the treatment of complications requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU mortality remains high for patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We evaluated the role of thrombocytopenia and poor graft function in allogeneic stem cell recipients receiving ICU treatments along with established prognostic ICU markers in order to identify patients at risk for severe complications. At ICU admission, clinical and laboratory data of 108 allogeneic stem cell transplanted ICU patients were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Platelet counts (≤ 50,000/μl, p < 0.0005), hemoglobin levels (≤ 8.5 mg/dl, p = 0.019), and leukocyte count (≤ 1500/μl, p = 0.025) along with sepsis (p = 0.002) and acute myeloid leukemia (p < 0.0005) correlated significantly with survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed thrombocytopenia (hazard ratio (HR) 2.79 (1.58-4.92, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and anemia (HR 1.82, 1.06-3.11, 95% CI) as independent mortality risk factors. Predominant ICU diagnoses were acute respiratory failure (75%), acute kidney injury (47%), and septic shock (30%). Acute graft versus host disease was diagnosed in 42% of patients, and 47% required vasopressors. Low platelet (≤ 50,000/μl) and poor graft function are independent prognostic factors for impaired survival in critically ill stem cell transplanted patients. The underlying pathophysiology of poor graft function is not fully understood and currently under investigation. High-risk patients may be identified and ICU treatments stratified according to allogeneic stem cell patients' individual risk profiles. In contrast to previous studies involving medical or surgical ICU patients, the fraction of thrombocytopenic patients was larger and low platelets were a better differentiating factor in multivariate analysis than any other parameter."

      To determine the prognostic impact of anemia in patients randomized to bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin (UFH) during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
    


          Background:
        
      
      Whether the periprocedural use of bivalirudin as compared with UFH in anemic patients undergoing TAVR has an impact on outcomes remains unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The BRAVO-3 trial compared the use of bivalirudin versus UFH in 802 high risk patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Patients were stratified according to the presence (defined as hemoglobin levels <13 g/dl in men and <12 g/dl in women) or absence of anemia. The primary outcomes were net adverse cardiac events (NACE; a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or bleeding) and major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ≥3b) at 30 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 798 patients with available baseline hemoglobin levels, 427 (54%) were anemic of whom 221 (52%) received bivalirudin. There were no significant differences in NACE and major bleeding at 30 days between patients with and without anemia, irrespective of the type of anticoagulant used (pinteraction = 0.71 for NACE, pinteraction = 1.0 for major bleeding). However, anemic patients had a higher risk of major vascular complications (adjusted OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.42-4.16, p = 0.001), and acute kidney injury (adjusted OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.16-2.59, p = 0.007) compared to non-anemic patients at 30 days.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Anemia was not associated with a higher risk of NACE or major bleeding at 30 days after TAVR without modification of the treatment effects of periprocedural anticoagulation with bivalirudin versus UFH."
Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) in Urine Identifies Patients with Short-Term Risk of eGFR Loss.,"Stephen Zewinger, Thomas Rauen, Michael Rudnicki, Giuseppina Federico, Martina Wagner, Sarah Triem, Stefan J Schunk, Ioannis Petrakis, David Schmit, Stefan Wagenpfeil, Gunnar H Heine, Gert Mayer, Jürgen Floege, Danilo Fliser, Hermann-Josef Gröne, Thimoteus Speer, Stephen Zewingeret al.",2018 Nov,J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30279273/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The individual course of CKD may vary, and improved methods for identifying which patients will experience short-term eGFR loss are needed. Assessing urinary Dickkopf-3 (DKK3), a stress-induced tubular epithelia-derived profibrotic glycoprotein, may provide information about ongoing tubulointerstitial fibrosis and short-term eGFR loss.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To investigate urinary DKK3's potential as a biomarker of short-term eGFR loss (over 12 months), we prospectively assessed eGFR and urinary DKK3 levels in patients with CKD of various etiologies at baseline and annual follow-ups. We also measured urinary DKK3 in a general population sample and patients with diagnostic kidney biopsies or IgA nephropathy under treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median urinary DKK3-to-creatinine concentration at baseline was significantly higher in patients with CKD than the general population sample (431 versus 33 pg/mg). In the CKD cohort, having a urinary DKK3-to-creatinine level >4000 pg/mg was independently and significantly associated after multiple adjustments with mean annual decline in eGFR of 7.6% over 12 months. Urinary DKK3 significantly improved prediction of kidney function decline compared with eGFR or albuminuria alone. Urinary DKK3-to-creatinine levels were related to the extent of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in kidney biopsies. In patients with IgA nephropathy, a rise in urinary DKK3 was associated with significant eGFR decline within 6 months, whereas stable or decreasing urinary DKK3 indicated a more favorable course.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Urinary DKK3 levels identify patients at high risk for eGFR decline over the next 12 months regardless of the cause of kidney injury and beyond established biomarkers, potentially providing a tool to monitor CKD progression and assess effects of interventions."
TAVR in Intermediate-Risk Patients: A Review of the PARTNER 2 Trial and its Future Implications.,"Sameer Arora, Cassandra J Ramm, Jacob A Misenheimer, John P Vavalle, Sameer Aroraet al.",2016 Nov,J Heart Valve Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28290162/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Following publication of the results of the PARTNER trial, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recognized the success of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) by incorporating it as a feasible option in high-surgical risk patients, and recommending it as the standard of care for patients at prohibitive risk of surgery. Although this was recognized as a major success in the field of percutaneous valve replacement, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) continued to be realized as the procedure of choice for low and intermediate surgical risk patients. Meanwhile, observational studies - predominantly from Europe - showed encouraging results for TAVR in lower-risk populations. With a lack of any large randomized controlled clinical trial, however, the advantages of TAVR continued to be limited to only a minority of patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Between December 2011 and November 2013, the PARTNER 2 investigators enrolled a total of 2,032 intermediate-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis at 57 centers in the United States and Canada. Patients were randomized 1:1 to undergo either TAVR or SAVR. The primary end point was death and neurological events after two years.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study results showed similar rates for death and neurological events in the TAVR and SAVR groups. The TAVR group was found to have a larger valve area and a lower incidence of acute kidney injury, bleeding events, and atrial fibrillation. Conversely, the SAVR group experienced fewer vascular complications and lower rates of paravalvular regurgitation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results of the PARTNER 2 trial are reviewed, and its implications for the future discussed."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with HF and secondary mitral regurgitation who develop persistent WRF within 30 days following TEER, and whether this development portends a worse prognosis. Methods and Results In the COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients With Functional Mitral Regurgitation) trial, 614 patients with HF and severe secondary mitral regurgitation were randomized to TEER with the MitraClip plus guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) versus GDMT alone. WRF was defined as serum creatinine increase ≥1.5× or ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline persisting to day 30 or requiring renal replacement therapy. All-cause death and HF hospitalization rates between 30 days and 2 years were compared in patients with and without WRF. WRF at 30 days was present in 11.3% of patients (9.7% in the TEER plus GDMT group and 13.1% in the GDMT alone group; P=0.23). WRF was associated with all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.98 [95% CI, 1.3-3.03]; P=0.001) but not HF hospitalization (HR, 1.47 [ 95% CI, 0.97-2.24]; P=0.07) between 30 days and 2 years. Compared with GDMT alone, TEER reduced both death and HF hospitalization consistently in patients with and without WRF (Pinteraction=0.53 and 0.57, respectively). Conclusions Among patients with HF and severe secondary mitral regurgitation, the incidence of WRF at 30 days was not increased after TEER compared with GDMT alone. WRF was associated with greater 2-year mortality but did not attenuate the treatment benefits of TEER in reducing death and HF hospitalization compared with GDMT alone.

      In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned older patients with myocardial infarction and multivessel disease who were undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the culprit lesion to receive either physiology-guided complete revascularization of nonculprit lesions or to receive no further revascularization. Functionally significant nonculprit lesions were identified either by pressure wire or angiography. The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any revascularization at 1 year. The key secondary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Safety was assessed as a composite of contrast-associated acute kidney injury, stroke, or bleeding.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1445 patients underwent randomization (720 to receive complete revascularization and 725 to receive culprit-only revascularization). The median age of the patients was 80 years (interquartile range, 77 to 84); 528 patients (36.5%) were women, and 509 (35.2%) were admitted for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A primary-outcome event occurred in 113 patients (15.7%) in the complete-revascularization group and in 152 patients (21.0%) in the culprit-only group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.93; P = 0.01). Cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction occurred in 64 patients (8.9%) in the complete-revascularization group and in 98 patients (13.5%) in the culprit-only group (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.88). The safety outcome did not appear to differ between the groups (22.5% vs. 20.4%; P = 0.37).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients who were 75 years of age or older with myocardial infarction and multivessel disease, those who underwent physiology-guided complete revascularization had a lower risk of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or ischemia-driven revascularization at 1 year than those who received culprit-lesion-only PCI.

Impact of Aortic Atherosclerosis Burden on Outcomes of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Alexander Iribarne, Stephanie Pan, Jock N McCullough, Joseph P Mathew, Judy Hung, Xin Zeng, Pierre Voisine, Patrick T O'Gara, Nancy M Sledz, Annetine C Gelijns, Wendy C Taddei-Peters, Steven R Messé, Alan J Moskowitz, Vinod H Thourani, Michael Argenziano, Mark A Groh, Gennaro Giustino, Jessica R Overbey, J Michael DiMaio, Peter K Smith, Alexander Iribarneet al.",2020 Feb,Ann Thorac Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31400333/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Epiaortic ultrasound detects and localizes ascending aortic atherosclerosis. In this analysis we investigated the association between epiaortic ultrasound-based atheroma grade during surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and perioperative adverse outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      SAVR patients in a randomized trial of 2 embolic protection devices underwent a protocol-defined 5-view epiaortic ultrasound read at a core laboratory. Aortic atherosclerosis was quantified with the Katz atheroma grade, and patients were categorized as mild (grade I-II) or moderate/severe (grade III-V). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations between atheroma grade and adverse outcomes, including death, clinically apparent stroke, cerebral infarction on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, delirium, and acute kidney injury (AKI) by 7 and 30 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Precannulation epiaortic ultrasound data were available for 326 of 383 randomized patients (85.1%). Of these, 106 (32.5%) had moderate/severe Katz atheroma grade at any segment of the ascending aorta. Although differences in the composite of death, stroke, or cerebral infarction on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging by 7 days were not statistically significant, moderate/severe atheroma grade was associated with a greater risk of AKI by 7 days (adjusted odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-5.58; P = .01). At 30 days, patients with moderate/severe atheroma grade had a greater risk of death, stroke, or AKI (adjusted odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.71; P = .04).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Moderate/severe aortic atherosclerosis was associated with an increased risk of adverse events after SAVR. Epiaortic ultrasound may serve as a useful adjunct for identifying patients who may benefit from strategies to reduce atheroembolic complications during SAVR."
Urinary TIMP-2 Predicts the Presence and Duration of Delayed Graft Function in Donation After Circulatory Death Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"Jonna R Bank, Renée Ruhaak, Darius Soonawala, Oleg Mayboroda, Fred P Romijn, Cees van Kooten, Christa M Cobbaert, Johan W de Fijter, Jonna R Banket al.",2019 May,Transplantation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30300282/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP7) have been validated as biomarkers for acute kidney injury. We investigated the performance of both markers in predicting the occurrence and duration of functionally defined delayed graft function (fDGF) in donation after circulatory death (DCD) kidney transplant recipients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Urine samples of 74 DCD recipients were analyzed. TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 were measured with ELISA on postoperative days 1 to 7, day 10, week 6, and month 6, and values were corrected for osmolality (mOsm). Immunosuppression consisted of anti-CD25 antibody induction and triple maintenance therapy (steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and calcineurin inhibitor). Statistical analysis included receiver operating characteristic curves and multivariate logistic regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-one (69%) renal transplant recipients had fDGF, of which 14 experienced prolonged fDGF (≥21 days). TIMP-2/mOsm on day-1 and day-10 adequately identified patients with fDGF (area under the curve [AUC], 0.91) and prolonged fDGF (AUC, 0.80), respectively, whereas IGFBP7/mOsm did not (AUC, 0.63 and 0.60). Multivariate analysis on day 1 identified 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion and TIMP-2/mOsm as significant predictors of fDGF (AUC, 0.90, 95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.98). The best predictors of prolonged fDGF on day 10 were 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion, TIMP-2/mOsm, and total warm ischemia time with an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.95). Consecutive TIMP-2/mOsm values showed a decrease in TIMP-2/mOsm before an increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate, enabling us to monitor fDGF and predict resolution of fDGF.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Urinary TIMP-2, but not IGFBP7, is a promising biomarker to predict the occurrence and duration of fDGF in DCD kidney transplant recipients."
Dose escalation of an Evans blue-modified radiolabeled somatostatin analog 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE in the treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.,"Qingxing Liu, Yuejuan Cheng, Jie Zang, Huimin Sui, Hao Wang, Orit Jacobson, Zhaohui Zhu, Xiaoyuan Chen, Qingxing Liuet al.",2020 Apr,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31832728/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE, a radiolabeled somatostatin analog modified by Evans blue, at escalating doses, was used to increase tumor retention in patients with progressive metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Thirty-three patients with metastatic NETs were prospectively enrolled into four groups: group A (n = 6, 43 ± 12 years) administered approximately 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) 177Lu-DOTATATE as controls; group B (n = 7, 55 ± 7 years) administered approximately 1.11 GBq (30 mCi) 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE; group C (n = 6, 55 ± 10 years) administered approximately 1.85 GBq (50 mCi) 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE; group D (n = 14, 50 ± 10 years) administered approximately 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE. Treatment-related adverse events were graded according to the CTCAE v.5.0. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT were performed at baseline and 2-3 months after treatment for response evaluation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Administration was well tolerated. No CTC 3/4 hematotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, or hepatotoxicity was observed during or after treatment in groups A-C. In group D, CTC-3 hematotoxicity was recorded in 2 patients with multicourse chemotherapy previously. After one-cycle treatment, the SUVmax decreased in group C (Δ% = - 17.4 ± 29.3%) and group D (Δ% = - 15.1 ± 39.1%), but greatly increased in group B (Δ% = 30.0 ± 68.0%) and mildly increased in group A (Δ% = 5.4 ± 45.9%). Referring to EORTC criteria, 16.7% (1/6), 0% (0/7), 50% (3/6), and 50% (7/14) were evaluated as partial response in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. When selecting lesions with comparable baseline SUVmax ranging from 15 to 40, SUVmax showed no significant decrease in group B (Δ% = - 7.3 ± 24.5%) (P = 0.214), significant decrease in group C (Δ% = - 34.9 ± 12.4%) (P = 0.001), and in group D (Δ% = - 17.9 ± 19.7%) (P = 0.012) as compared with group A with increased SUVmax (Δ% = 8.4 ± 48.8%). SUVmax significantly decreased in the EBTATE groups (groups B-D combined) (Δ% = - 19.0 ± 21.5%) as compared with the TATE group (P = 0.045).
    


          Conclusion:
        
177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE is well tolerated and is more effective than 177Lu-DOTATATE. Both 1.85 GBq (50 mCi) and 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) doses appear to be more effective than 1.11 GBq (30 mCi) dose. Further investigation with more cycles of 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE treatment and longer follow-up is warranted.

Renal function following xenon anesthesia for partial nephrectomy-An explorative analysis of a randomized controlled study.,"Ana Stevanovic, Patrick Schaefer, Mark Coburn, Rolf Rossaint, Christian Stoppe, Peter Boor, David Pfister, Axel Heidenreich, Hildegard Christ, Martin Hellmich, Astrid V Fahlenkamp, Ana Stevanovicet al.",2017 Jul 18,PLoS One,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28719609/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Perioperative preservation of renal function has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality in kidney surgery. Nephroprotective effects of the anesthetic xenon on ischemia-reperfusion injury were found in several experimental studies.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We aimed to explore whether xenon anesthesia can reduce renal damage in humans undergoing partial nephrectomy and to gather pilot data of possible nephroprotection in these patients.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A prospective randomized, single-blinded, controlled study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Single-center, University Hospital of Aachen, Germany between July 2013-October 2015.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Forty-six patients with regular renal function undergoing partial nephrectomy.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive xenon- (n = 23) or isoflurane (n = 23) anesthesia.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Primary outcome was the maximum postoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline within seven days after surgery. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative and tumor-related data, assessment of further kidney injury markers, adverse events and optional determination of renal function after 3-6 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Unexpected radical nephrectomy was performed in 5 patients, thus they were excluded from the per-protocol analysis, but included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The maximum postoperative GFR decline was attenuated by 45% in the xenon-group (10.9 ml min-1 1.73 cm-2 versus 19.7 ml min-1 1.73 cm-2 in the isoflurane group), but without significance (P = 0.084). Occurrence of adverse events was reduced (P = 0.003) in the xenon group. Renal function was similar among the groups after 3-6 months.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Xenon anesthesia was feasible and safe in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy with regard to postoperative renal function. We found no significant effect on early renal function but less adverse events in the xenon group. Larger randomized controlled studies in more heterogeneous collectives are required, to confirm or refute the possible clinical benefit on renal function by xenon.

      Clinical trials in nephrology are enriched for patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria to enroll patients at risk of kidney failure. However, patients with normoalbuminuria can also progress to kidney failure. TNF receptor-1, TNF receptor-2, and kidney injury marker-1 (KIM-1) are known to be associated with kidney disease progression in patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria. We assessed the value of TNF receptor-1, TNF receptor-2, and KIM-1 as prognostic biomarkers for CKD progression in patients with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      TNF receptor-1, TNF receptor-2, and KIM-1 were measured using immunoassays in plasma samples from patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk participating in the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study trial. We used multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards analyses to estimate hazard ratios per doubling of each biomarker for the kidney outcome, stratified the population by the fourth quartile of each biomarker distribution, and assessed the number of events and event rates.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In patients with normoalbuminuria (n=2553), 51 kidney outcomes were recorded during a median follow-up of 6.1 (interquartile range, 5.8-6.4) years (event rate, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 4.6 per 1000 patient-years). Each doubling of baseline TNF receptor-1 (hazard ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 9.6) and TNF receptor-2 (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.6) was associated with a higher risk for the kidney outcome. Baseline KIM-1, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, and eGFR were not associated with kidney outcomes. The event rates in the highest quartile of TNF receptor-1 (≥2992 ng/ml) and TNF receptor-2 (≥11,394 ng/ml) were 5.6 and 7.0 events per 1000 patient-years, respectively, compared with 2.8 and 2.3, respectively, in the lower three quartiles.

      Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is an early marker of renal tubular damage. We investigated the incidence and possible implications of elevated NGAL levels (suggesting renal damage) compared to both functional and damage markers (manifested as serum creatinine [sCr] elevation) and no NGAL/sCr change, among -ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We included 131 patients with STEMI treated with PCI. Blood samples for plasma NGAL were drawn 24 h following PCI. We used the terms NGAL(-) or NGAL(+) with levels ≥100 ng/mL suggesting renal tubular damage and the terms. sCr(-) or sCr(+) to consensus diagnostic increases in sCr defining acute kidney injury. Patients were also assessed for in hospital-adverse outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the study patients, 56 (42%) were NGAL(-)/sCr(-), 58 (44%) NGAL(+)/sCr(-), and 18 (14%) were both NGAL(+)/sCr(+). According to the 3 study groups, there was a stepwise increase in the proportion of left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45% (43 vs. 60. vs. 72%; p = 0.04), in-hospital adverse outcomes (9 vs. 14 vs. 56%; p < 0.001) and their combination. Specifically, more NGAL(+)/sCr(-) patients developed the composite endpoint when compared to NGAL(-)/sCr(-) patients (64 vs. 46%; OR 2.1, [95% CI 1.1-4.5], p = 0.05). A similar and consistent increase was observed in peak sCr, length of hospital stay, and C-reactive protein levels.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Elevated NGAL levels suggesting renal tubular damage, increased inflammation, or both are common among STEMI patients and are associated with adverse outcomes even in the absence of diagnostic increase in sCr."

      This was a prospective, single-blinded cohort study conducted for 1 year from July 2018 to June 2019.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      The study setting was the Department of Transfusion Medicine, along with Cardiac Anaesthesia, Cardiac Surgery and Cardiac biochemistry departments in a tertiary care cardiac centre.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      A total of 150 patients undergoing cardiac surgery during the study period were divided into three groups (50 in each): Leukofiltered (LR), Buffy coat depleted (BCD) and Non-leukoreduced (NLR).
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      The intervention was intra- and postoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) having different amounts of leukocytes.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Patient details about length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, blood usage, inotropic drug duration, mechanical ventilation, urine output and infection were recorded from the patient data sheet, whereas patients were followed up for 30 days post-operation, and any mortality was noted. Haematological parameters and biochemical parameters for renal function test were analysed on pre- and post-surgical days 1, 3, 5 and 7, whereas on postoperative days 1 and 7, cytokine-like FAS ligands, Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Interferon-γ (INF-γ) were tested. Patients in all three groups received an average of four, two and two units of packed red blood cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma, respectively. There was a statistically significant (P < .05) rise in total leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte count in all three groups from day 0 to day 3, but it reduced to preoperative level on day 5. There was shorter ICU and hospital stay in the LR group of patients (46 ± 19.9 hours and 7.5 ± 2.4 days) compared to NLR (52.1 ± 24.2 hours and 7.9 ± 4.1 days) and BCD (53.3 ± 26.7 hours and 8.8 ± 3.1 days) group of patients, but it was statistically non-significant. The duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly lesser in LR group patients (10.2 ± 6.2 hours) as compared to NLR group (14.7 ± 12.7 hours). On risk ratio calculation of developing postoperative kidney injury, the NLR group had 1.3 and 2.6 times more risk compared to the BCD and LR groups, respectively. On postoperative days 1 and 7, FAS-L levels significantly increased in all three group of patients, whereas IL-10 increased in the NLR and BCD groups and decreased in the LR group non-significantly. The INF-γ levels decreased on day 1 in the NLR and BCD groups but increased in the LR group, but it was inversed on day 7.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Depletion of leukocytes decreased Transfusion Related Immunomodulation (TRIM) effects in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but this also depends on the degree of leukoreduction. As found in our study, leukofiltration is more effective compared to buffy-coat depletion only."
Effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery: a randomised controlled clinical trial.,"Luciano Candilio, Abdul Malik, Cono Ariti, Matthew Barnard, Carmelo Di Salvo, David Lawrence, Martin Hayward, John Yap, Neil Roberts, Amir Sheikh, Shyam Kolvekar, Derek J Hausenloy, Derek M Yellon, Luciano Candilioet al.",2015 Feb,Heart,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25252696/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), using brief cycles of limb ischaemia/reperfusion, is a non-invasive, low-cost intervention that may reduce perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We investigated whether RIPC can also improve short-term clinical outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred and eighty patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and/or valve surgery were randomised to receive either RIPC (2-5 min cycles of simultaneous upper arm and thigh cuff inflation/deflation; N=90) or control (uninflated cuffs placed on the upper arm and thigh; N=90). The study primary end point was PMI, measured by 72 h area under the curve (AUC) serum high-sensitive troponin-T (hsTnT); secondary end point included short-term clinical outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      RIPC reduced PMI magnitude by 26% (-9.303 difference (CI -15.618 to -2.987) 72 h hsTnT-AUC; p=0.003) compared with control. There was also evidence that RIPC reduced the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation by 54% (11% RIPC vs 24% control; p=0.031) and decreased the incidence of acute kidney injury by 48% (10.0% RIPC vs 21.0% control; p=0.063), and intensive care unit stay by 1 day (2.0 days RIPC (CI 1.0 to 4.0) vs 3.0 days control (CI 2.0 to 4.5); p=0.043). In a post hoc analysis, we found that control patients administered intravenous glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) intraoperatively sustained 39% less PMI compared with those not receiving GTN, and RIPC did not appear to reduce PMI in patients given GTN.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RIPC reduced the extent of PMI in patients undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery. RIPC may also have beneficial effects on short-term clinical outcomes, although this will need to be confirmed in future studies.

Urinary Biomarkers in the Prediction of Prognosis and Treatment Response in IgA Nephropathy.,"Julia Neuhaus, Frederic Bauer, Christina Fitzner, Ralf-Dieter Hilgers, Felix Seibert, Nina Babel, Adrian Doevelaar, Frank Eitner, Jürgen Floege, Thomas Rauen, Timm H Westhoff, Julia Neuhauset al.",2018,Kidney Blood Press Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30347407/,No keywords found,"Background/aims:
        
      
      The addition of immunosuppression to supportive care reduces proteinuria in a subset of patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) but is associated with an increased rate of adverse events. The present work investigates whether urinary biomarkers are able to identify subjects who benefit from immunosuppression and to predict the progression of disease in a sub-cohort of the STOP-IgAN trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), calprotectin, and the product of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (TIMP2•IGFBP7) were measured in all available urine samples obtained at the time point of enrollment in the STOP-IgAN trial (n=113).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Biomarker concentrations in both the overall study population and the subgroup with additional immunosuppression did not differ in subjects reaching vs. not reaching full clinical remission, eGFR loss ≥ 15, or 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 over the 3-year trial phase (p> 0.05 each). Receiver-operating characteristic curves showed a poor predictive accuracy of each biomarker for the above-mentioned parameters in the overall study population (areas under the curve ≤0.611). Accordingly, there was neither a significant correlation of any biomarker and adverse outcome in linear regression analysis, nor between biomarker concentrations at enrollment and change in the eGFR over the 3-year observation period.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      NGAL, KIM-1, calprotectin, and [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] had neither a prognostic value for the progression of IgAN, nor for the response to immunosuppression in the present sub-cohort of the STOP-IgAN trial. The search for appropriate biomarkers for an individualized treatment strategy in IgAN continues."
Impact of diabetes mellitus on short term vascular complications after TAVR: Results from the BRAVO-3 randomized trial.,"Ridhima Goel, David Power, Didier Tchetche, Rishi Chandiramani, Paul Guedeney, Bimmer E Claessen, Samantha Sartori, Davide Cao, Nicolas Meneveau, Christophe Tron, Nicolas Dumonteil, Julian D Widder, Christian Hengstenberg, Markus Ferrari, Roberto Violini, Pieter R Stella, Raban Jeger, Prodromos Anthopoulos, Efthymios N Deliargyris, Roxana Mehran, George D Dangas, Ridhima Goelet al.",2019 Dec 15:297:22-29.,Int J Cardiol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31630816/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      The impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of DM on short-term clinical outcomes after TAVR in a large randomized trial population.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      BRAVO-3 trial randomized 802 patients undergoing trans-femoral TAVR to procedural anticoagulation with bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin. The study population was divided according to the presence of DM, and further stratified according to the use of insulin. Net adverse cardiovascular outcomes (NACE - death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or major bleeding by Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 3b or above) was the primary outcome in-hospital and at 30-days. Of the total 802 randomized patients, 239 (30%) had DM at baseline, with 87 (36%) being treated with insulin. At 30-days, DM patients experienced numerically higher rates of net adverse cardiovascular events (16.3% vs. 14.4%, p=0.48) and acute kidney injury (19.7% vs. 15.1%, p=0.11), while non-DM (NDM) patients had numerically higher rates of cerebrovascular accidents (3.6% vs. 1.7%, p=0.22). After multivariable adjustment, DM patients had higher odds of vascular complications at 30-days (OR 1.57, p=0.03) and life-threatening bleeding both in-hospital (OR 1.50, p=0.046) and at 30-days (OR 1.50, p=0.03) with the excess overall risk primarily attributed to the higher rates observed among non-insulin dependent DM patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with DM had higher adjusted odds of vascular and bleeding complications up to 30-days post-TAVR. Overall, there was no significant association between DM and early mortality following TAVR."

      Suicide and suicide attempts are persistent and increasing public health problems. Observational studies and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials have suggested that lithium may prevent suicide in patients with bipolar disorder or depression.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess whether lithium augmentation of usual care reduces the rate of repeated episodes of suicide-related events (repeated suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide) in participants with bipolar disorder or depression who have survived a recent event.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial assessed lithium vs placebo augmentation of usual care in veterans with bipolar disorder or depression who had survived a recent suicide-related event. Veterans at 29 VA medical centers who had an episode of suicidal behavior or an inpatient admission to prevent suicide within 6 months were screened between July 1, 2015, and March 31, 2019.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants were randomized to receive extended-release lithium carbonate beginning at 600 mg/d or placebo.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Time to the first repeated suicide-related event, including suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations specifically to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trial was stopped for futility after 519 veterans (mean [SD] age, 42.8 [12.4] years; 437 [84.2%] male) were randomized: 255 to lithium and 264 to placebo. Mean lithium concentrations at 3 months were 0.54 mEq/L for patients with bipolar disorder and 0.46 mEq/L for patients with major depressive disorder. No overall difference in repeated suicide-related events between treatments was found (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.77-1.55). No unanticipated safety concerns were observed. A total of 127 participants (24.5%) had suicide-related outcomes: 65 in the lithium group and 62 in the placebo group. One death occurred in the lithium group and 3 in the placebo group.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      In this randomized clinical trial, the addition of lithium to usual Veterans Affairs mental health care did not reduce the incidence of suicide-related events in veterans with major depression or bipolar disorders who experienced a recent suicide event. Therefore, simply adding lithium to existing medication regimens is unlikely to be effective for preventing a broad range of suicide-related events in patients who are actively being treated for mood disorders and substantial comorbidities.

Safety and efficacy of a self-expanding versus a balloon-expandable bioprosthesis for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a randomised non-inferiority trial.,"Jonas Lanz, Won-Keun Kim, Thomas Walther, Christof Burgdorf, Helge Möllmann, Axel Linke, Simon Redwood, Christian Thilo, Michael Hilker, Michael Joner, Holger Thiele, Lars Conzelmann, Lenard Conradi, Sebastian Kerber, Gerhard Schymik, Bernard Prendergast, Oliver Husser, Stefan Stortecky, Dik Heg, Peter Jüni, Stephan Windecker, Thomas Pilgrim                              ;, SCOPE I investigators, Jonas Lanzet al.",2019 Nov 2,Lancet,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570258/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is the preferred treatment option for older patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Differences in the properties of available TAVR systems can affect clinical outcomes. Among patients undergoing TAVR, we compared the self-expanding ACURATE neo TAVR system with the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 TAVR system with regard to early safety and efficacy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomised non-inferiority trial, patients (aged ≥75 years) undergoing transfemoral TAVR for treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, and who were deemed to be at increased surgical risk, were recruited at 20 tertiary heart valve centres in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the UK. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment with the ACURATE neo or the SAPIEN 3 with a computer-based randomly permuted block scheme, stratified by study centre and Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) category. The primary composite safety and efficacy endpoint comprised all-cause death, any stroke, life-threatening or disabling bleeding, major vascular complications, coronary artery obstruction requiring intervention, acute kidney injury (stage 2 or 3), rehospitalisation for valve-related symptoms or congestive heart failure, valve-related dysfunction requiring repeat procedure, moderate or severe prosthetic valve regurgitation, or prosthetic valve stenosis within 30 days of the procedure. Endpoint assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Non-inferiority of ACURATE neo compared with SAPIEN 3 was assessed in the intention-to-treat population on the basis of a risk-difference margin of 7·7% for the primary composite endpoint, with a one-sided α of 0·05. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT03011346) and is ongoing but not recruiting.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Feb 8, 2017, and Feb 2, 2019, up to 5132 patients were screened and 739 (mean age 82·8 years [SD 4·1]; median STS-PROM score 3·5% [IQR 2·6-5·0]) were enrolled. 30-day follow-up was available for 367 (99%) of 372 patients allocated to the ACURATE neo group, and 364 (99%) of 367 allocated to the SAPIEN 3 group. Within 30 days, the primary endpoint occurred in 87 (24%) patients in the ACURATE neo and in 60 (16%) in the SAPIEN 3 group; thus, non-inferiority of the ACURATE neo was not met (absolute risk difference 7·1% [upper 95% confidence limit 12·0%], p=0·42). Secondary analysis of the primary endpoint suggested superiority of the SAPIEN 3 device over the ACURATE neo device (95% CI for risk difference -1·3 to -12·9, p=0·0156). The ACURATE neo and SAPIEN 3 groups did not differ in incidence of all-cause death (nine patients [2%] vs three [1%]) and stroke (seven [2%] vs 11 [3%]); whereas acute kidney injury (11 [3%] vs three [1%]) and moderate or severe prosthetic aortic regurgitation (34 [9%] vs ten [3%]) were more common in the ACURATE neo group.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      TAVR with the self-expanding ACURATE neo did not meet non-inferiority compared to the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 device in terms of early safety and clinical efficacy outcomes. An early composite safety and efficacy endpoint was useful in discriminating the performance of different TAVR systems.

      To compare the safety of on- vs off-clamp robotic partial nephrectomy (RAPN).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      302 patients with RENAL masses ≤ 10 were randomized to undergo on-clamp (150) vs off-clamp (152) RAPN (CLOCK trial-ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02287987) at seven institutions by one experienced surgeon per institution. Intra-operative data, complications, and positive surgical margins were compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Due to a relevant rate of shift from the assigned treatment, the per-protocol analysis only was considered and the data from 129 on-clamp vs 91 off-clamp RAPNs analyzed. Tumor size (off-clamp vs on-clamp, 2.2 vs 3.0 cm, p < 0.001) and RENAL score (5 vs 6, p < 0.001) significantly differed. At univariate analysis, no differences were found regarding intra-operative estimated blood loss (off- vs on-clamp, 100 vs 100 ml, p = 0.7), post-operative complications rate (19% vs 26%, p = 0.2), post-operative anemia (Hb decrease > 2.5 g/dl 26% vs 27%, p = 0.9; transfusion rate 3.4% vs 6.3%, p = 0.5; re-intervention due to bleeding 1.1% vs 4%, p = 0.4), acute kidney injury (4% vs 6%, p = 0.8), and positive surgical margins (3.5% vs 8.2%, p = 0.1). At multivariate analysis accounting for tumor diameter and complexity, considering the on-clamp group as the reference category, a significant difference was noted in the off-clamp group exclusively for blood loss (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.09-0.52, p = 0.008).
    


          Conclusions:

      Intraoperative and postoperative hypotension are associated with myocardial and kidney injury and 30-day mortality. Intraoperative blood pressure is measured frequently, but blood pressure on surgical wards is usually measured only every 4 to 6 h, leaving long intervals during which hypotension and hypertension may be undetected. This study evaluated the incidence and severity of postoperative hypotension and hypertension in adults recovering from abdominal surgery and the extent to which serious perturbations were missed by routine vital-sign assessments.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Blood pressure was recorded at 1-min intervals during the initial 48 h in adults recovering from abdominal surgery using a continuous noninvasive monitor. Caregivers were blinded to these measurements and depended on routine vital-sign assessments. Hypotension and hypertension were characterized as time under and above various mean arterial pressure thresholds.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 502 available patients, 312 patients with high-quality records were analyzed, with a median measurement time of 48 [interquartile range: 41, 48] postoperative hours. Nearly a quarter experienced an episode of mean arterial pressure of less than 70 mm Hg lasting at least 30 min (24%; 95% CI, 20%, 29%), and 18% had an episode of mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg lasting at least 15 min. Nearly half the patients who had mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg for at least 15 min (47%; 95% CI, 34%, 61%) were undetected by routine vital-sign assessments. Episodes of mean arterial pressure greater than 110 mm Hg lasting at least 30 min were observed in 42% (95% CI, 37%, 48%) of patients; 7% had mean arterial pressure greater than 130 mm Hg for at least 30 min, 96% of which were missed by routine assessments. Episodes of mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg and mean arterial pressure greater than 110 mm Hg captured by routine vital-sign assessments but not by continuous monitoring occurred in 34 and 8 patients, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Postoperative hypotension and hypertension were common, prolonged, profound, and largely undetected by routine vital-sign assessments in a cohort of adults recovering from abdominal surgery. Frequent or continuous blood pressure monitoring may detect hemodynamic perturbations more effectively and potentially facilitate treatment."
Expression of HO1 and PER2 can predict the incidence of delirium in trauma patients with concomitant brain injury.,"Matti Steimer, Sandra Kaiser, Felix Ulbrich, Johannes Kalbhenn, Hartmut Bürkle, Nils Schallner, Matti Steimeret al.",2021 Jul 28,Sci Rep,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34321570/,No keywords found,"Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired delirium is associated with adverse outcome in trauma patients with concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), but diagnosis remains challenging. Quantifying circadian disruption by analyzing expression of the circadian gene period circadian regulator 2 (PER2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), which determines heme turnover, may prove to be potential diagnostic tools. Expression of PER2 and HO1 was quantified using qPCR from blood samples 1 day and 7 days after trauma. Association analysis was performed comparing mRNA expression levels with parameters of trauma (ISS-injury severity score), delirium, acute kidney injury (AKI) and length of ICU stay. 48 polytraumatized patients were included (equal distribution of TBI versus non-TBI) corrected for ISS, age and gender using a matched pairs approach. Expression levels of PER2 and HO1 were independent of age (PER2: P = 0.935; HO1: P = 0.988), while expression levels were significantly correlated with trauma severity (PER2: P = 0.009; HO1: P < 0.001) and longer ICU length of stay (PER2: P = 0.018; HO1: P < 0.001). High expression levels increased the odds of delirium occurrence (PER2: OR = 4.32 [1.14-13.87]; HO1: OR = 4.50 [1.23-14.42]). Patients with TBI showed a trend towards elevated PER2 (OR = 3.00 [0.84-9.33], P = 0.125), but not towards delirium occurrence (P = 0.556). TBI patients were less likely to develop AKI compared to non-TBI (P = 0.022). Expression levels of PER2 and HO1 correlate with the incidence of delirium in an age-independent manner and may potentially improve diagnostic algorithms when used as delirium biomarkers.Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register (Trial-ID DRKS00008981; Universal Trial Number U1111-1172-6077; Jan. 18, 2018)."
The efficacy and safety of quantitative flow ratio-guided complete revascularization in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and multivessel disease: A pilot randomized controlled trial.,"Jing Zhang, Mingyan Yao, Xinwei Jia, Huiping Feng, Jingjing Fu, Wei Tang, Hongliang Cong, Jing Zhanget al.",2023,Cardiol J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34581424/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and multivessel disease (MVD), the treatment strategy for non-infarct-related artery (non-IRA) remains controversial. Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a new angiography-based physiological assessment index. However, there is little evidence on the practical clinical application of QFR.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two hundred and twenty-nine patients with STEMI and MVD were recruited for this study. Patients were randomly assigned to either receive QFR-guided complete revascularization (QFR-G-CR) of non-IRA or receive no further invasive treatment. The primary (1°) endpoint analyzed included death due to all causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and ischemia-induced revascularization at 12 months post-surgery. Secondary (2°) endpoints included cardiovascular death, unstable angina, stent thrombosis, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure, and stroke at 1 year post surgery. Massive bleeding and contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CAKI) were used as safety endpoints.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Around the 12 month follow up, the 1o outcome was recorded in 11/115 patients (9.6%) in the QFR-G-CR population, relative to 23/114 patients (20.1%) in the IRA-only PCI population (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22-0.92; p = 0.025). Unstable angina in 6 (5.2%) and 16 (14.0%) patients (HR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14-0.92; p = 0.026), respectively. No marked alterations were found in the massive bleeding and CAKI categories.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In conclusion, STEMI and MVD patients can benefit from QFR-G-CR of non-IRA lesions in the initial stages of acute MI. This can help reduce incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events and unstable angina, relative to IRA treatment only. Chinese Clinical Trial Registration number: ChiCTR2100044120."

Research has proven that imaging-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduces contrast volume significantly; however, only short-term clinical benefits have been reported. Minimum-contrast (MINICON) studies are based on the registry design pattern to enroll PCI results in patients with advanced CKD stage 4 or 5 comorbid with coronary artery disease. We excluded cases of emergency PCI or maintenance dialysis from this study. In this study, we compared the intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided MINICON PCI group (n = 98) with the angiography-guided standard PCI group (n = 86). Enrollment of the MINICON studies started in 2006. Before 2012, IVUS-guided MINICON PCI was performed only in 14% (stage 1), but it was 100% after 2012 (stage 2). The enrollment finished in 2016. The IVUS-guided MINICON PCI group exhibited a significantly reduced contrast volume (22 ± 20 vs. 130 ± 105 mL; P < 0.0001) and contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI; 2% vs. 15%; P = 0.001). The PCI success rate was similarly high (100% vs. 99%; P = 0.35). At 1 year (follow-up rate, 100%), we observed less induction of renal replacement therapy (RRT; 2.7% vs. 13.6%; P = 0.01), but all-cause mortality or myocardial infarction was similar in both groups.

      Procedural details of 3,532 patients were examined to determine whether BPD was performed after self-expanding TAVR. ""Best practice"" guidelines recommended BPD for treatment of suboptimal intraprocedural valve function, primarily manifested by moderate or severe residual aortic regurgitation (AR).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Procedural BPD was performed in 782 patients (22%) patients. The most common (58.1%) indication was greater than or equal to moderate AR following valve deployment. Greater baseline aortic valve gradients (p < 0.001), higher grades of baseline AR (p < 0.001), larger annular diameters (p < 0.001), and lower device to annular ratios (p < 0.001) were more common in patients who underwent BPD. BPD was performed less often with the 26-mm valve (17.9%) compared to the 31 mm (38.1%) (p < 0.05). BPD reduced moderate or severe AR by 75.6% from 58.1% to 14.2%. Thirty-day and 1-year clinical events were similar in the 2 groups, although acute kidney injury was more common in patients undergoing BPD (p = 0.026). In-hospital major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event rates were 9.3% in the BPD group versus 7.5% for others (p = NS). There was no increase in neurological events.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      BPD of the self-expanding bioprosthesis was performed in 22% of patients in the CoreValve US Clinical Trials most commonly to reduce the degree of residual AR. BPD was effective in acutely improving valve performance without an associated increase in neurologic events.

Hyperhydration to Improve Kidney Outcomes in Children with Shiga Toxin-Producing E. coli Infection: a multinational embedded cluster crossover randomized trial (the HIKO STEC trial).,"Stephen B Freedman, David Schnadower, Myka Estes, T Charles Casper, Stuart L Goldstein, Silviu Grisaru, Andrew T Pavia, Benjamin S Wilfond, Melissa Metheney, Kadyn Kimball, Phillip I Tarr                              ;, Hyperhydration to Improve Kidney Outcomes in children with Shiga Toxin-producing E. Coli infection (HIKO-STEC) Study Team, Stephen B Freedmanet al.",2023 May 27,Trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37245030/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infections affect children and adults worldwide, and treatment remain solely supportive. Up to 15-20% of children infected by high-risk STEC (i.e., E. coli that produce Shiga toxin 2) develop hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure (i.e., hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)), over half of whom require acute dialysis and 3% die. Although no therapy is widely accepted as being able to prevent the development of HUS and its complications, several observational studies suggest that intravascular volume expansion (hyperhydration) may prevent end organ damage. A randomized trial is needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We will conduct a pragmatic, embedded, cluster-randomized, crossover trial in 26 pediatric institutions to determine if hyperhydration, compared to conservative fluid management, improves outcomes in 1040 children with high-risk STEC infections. The primary outcome is major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30), a composite measure that includes death, initiation of new renal replacement therapy, or persistent kidney dysfunction. Secondary outcomes include life-threatening, extrarenal complications, and development of HUS. Pathway eligible children will be treated per institutional allocation to each pathway. In the hyperhydration pathway, all eligible children are hospitalized and administered 200% maintenance balanced crystalloid fluids up to targets of 10% weight gain and 20% reduction in hematocrit. Sites in the conservative fluid management pathway manage children as in- or outpatients, based on clinician preference, with the pathway focused on close laboratory monitoring, and maintenance of euvolemia. Based on historical data, we estimate that 10% of children in our conservative fluid management pathway will experience the primary outcome. With 26 clusters enrolling a mean of 40 patients each with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.11, we will have 90% power to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      HUS is a devastating illness with no treatment options. This pragmatic study will determine if hyperhydration can reduce morbidity associated with HUS in children with high-risk STEC infection.

Predictors of overall survival among patients treated with sirolimus/tacrolimus vs methotrexate/tacrolimus for GvHD prevention.,"F Khimani, J Kim, L Chen, E Dean, V Rizk, B Betts, T Nishihori, F Locke, A Mishra, L Perez, E Ayala, M Kharfan-Dabaja, M Nieder, H Fernandez, C Anasetti, J Pidala, F Khimaniet al.",2017 Jul,Bone Marrow Transplant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28368376/,No keywords found,"Sirolimus (SIR)/tacrolimus (TAC) is an alternative to methotrexate (MTX)/TAC. However, rational selection among these GvHD prophylaxis approaches to optimize survival of individual patients is not possible based on current evidence. We compared SIR/TAC (n=293) to MTX/TAC (n=414). The primary objective was to identify unique predictors of overall survival (OS). Secondary objective was to compare acute and chronic GvHD, relapse, non-relapse mortality, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD/SOS), and acute kidney injury. Day 100 grades II-IV acute GvHD was significantly reduced in SIR/TAC vs MTX/TAC group (63 vs 73%, P=0.02). An interaction between GvHD prophylaxis groups and comorbidity index (hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)-CI) significantly impacted OS. Patients with HCT-CI⩾4 had significantly worse OS with MTX/TAC (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.14-3.04, P=0.01) while no such effect was seen for SIR/TAC (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48-1.26, P=0.31). Other end points did not significantly differ between groups except TMA and VOD/SOS were increased in the SIR/TAC group, but excess death from these complications was not observed. We conclude, GvHD prophylaxis approach of SIR/TAC is associated with reduced grades II-IV acute GvHD, comparable toxicity profile to MTX/TAC, and improved OS among patients with HCT-CI⩾4."
Effects of Reduced Dietary Sodium and the DASH Diet on GFR: The DASH-Sodium Trial.,"Martha Catalina Morales-Alvarez, Voravech Nissaisorakarn, Lawrence J Appel, Edgar R Miller rd, Robert H Christenson, Heather Rebuck, Sylvia E Rosas, Jeffrey H William, Stephen P Juraschek, Martha Catalina Morales-Alvarezet al.",2024 Apr 1,Kidney360,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38326949/,No keywords found,"Key Points:
        
Sodium reduction over a 4-week period decreased eGFR.Combining sodium reduction with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet resulted in larger reductions in eGFR.Changes in diastolic BP seem partially responsible for the observed dietary effects.



          Background:
        
      
      A potassium-rich Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet combined with low sodium reduces BP. However, the effects of sodium reduction in combination with the DASH diet on kidney function are unknown. We determined the effects of sodium reduction and the DASH diet, on eGFR using cystatin C.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      DASH-sodium was a controlled, feeding study in adults with elevated or stage 1 hypertension, randomly assigned to the DASH or a control diet. On their assigned diet, participants consumed each of three sodium levels for 30 days after a 2-week run-in period of a high sodium-control diet. The three sodium levels were low (50 mmol/d), medium (100 mmol/d), and high (150 mmol/d). The primary outcome was change in eGFR based on cystatin C.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Cystatin C was measured in 409 of the original 412 participants, of which 207 were assigned the DASH diet and 202 to the control diet. Compared with control, the DASH diet did not affect eGFR (β=−0.96 ml/min per 1.73 m2; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.74 to 0.83). By contrast, low versus high sodium intake decreased eGFR (β=−2.36 ml/min per 1.73 m2; 95% CI, −3.64 to −1.07). Together, compared with the high sodium-control diet, the low sodium-DASH diet decreased eGFR by 3.10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (95% CI, −5.46 to −0.73). This effect was attenuated with adjustment for diastolic BP and 24-hour urinary potassium excretion.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A combined low sodium-DASH diet reduced eGFR over a 4-week period. Future research should focus on the effect of these dietary interventions on subclinical kidney injury and their long-term effect on progression to CKD.

Perioperative individualized hemodynamic optimization according to baseline mean arterial pressure in cardiac surgery patients: Rationale and design of the OPTIPAM randomized trial.,"Richard Descamps, Julien Amour, Emmanuel Besnier, Adrien Bougle, Hélène Charbonneau, Martin Charvin, Bernard Cholley, Olivier Desebbe, Jean-Luc Fellahi, Denis Frasca, François Labaste, Diane Lena, Yazine Mahjoub, Paul-Michel Mertes, Serge Molliex, Pierre-Henri Moury, Mouhamed Djahoum Moussa, Jean-Ferreol Oilleau, Alexandre Ouattara, Sophie Provenchere, Bertand Rozec, Jean-Jacques Parienti, Marc-Olivier Fischer                              ;, OPTIPAM investigators, Richard Descampset al.",2023 Jul:261:10-20.,Am Heart J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36934980/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Postoperative morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) remain high despite recent advances in both anesthesia and perioperative management. Among modifiable risk factors for postoperative complications, optimal arterial pressure during and after surgery has been under debate for years. Recent data suggest that optimizing arterial pressure to the baseline of the patient may improve outcomes. We hypothesize that optimizing the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to the baseline MAP of the patient during cardiac surgery with CPB and during the first 24 hours postoperatively may improve outcomes.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      The OPTIPAM trial (NCT05403697) will be a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial testing the superiority of optimized MAP management as compared with a MAP of 65 mm Hg or more during both the intraoperative and postoperative periods in 1,100 patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with CPB. The primary composite end point is the occurrence of acute kidney injury, neurological complications including stroke or postoperative delirium, and death. The secondary end points are hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, Day 7 and Day 90 mortality, postoperative cognitive dysfunction on Day 7 and Day 90, and quality of life at Day 7 and Day 90. Two interim analyses will assess the safety of the intervention.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The OPTIPAM trial will assess the effectiveness of an individualized target of mean arterial pressure in cardiac surgery with CPB in reducing postoperative morbidity.

      Corticosteroids are widely used in pediatric cardiac surgery to blunt systemic inflammatory response and to reduce complications; nevertheless, their clinical efficacy is uncertain.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether intraoperative administration of dexamethasone is more effective than placebo for reducing major complications and mortality during pediatric cardiac surgery.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      The Intraoperative Dexamethasone in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery was an investigator-initiated, double-blind, multicenter randomized trial that involved 4 centers in China, Brazil, and Russia. A total of 394 infants younger than 12 months, undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled from December 2015 to October 2018, with follow-up completed in November 2018.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      The dexamethasone group (n = 194) received 1 mg/kg of dexamethasone; the control group (n = 200) received an equivolume of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously after anesthesia induction.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary end point was a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, acute kidney injury, prolonged mechanical ventilation, or neurological complications within 30 days after surgery. There were 17 secondary end points, including the individual components of the primary end point, and duration of mechanical ventilation, inotropic index, intensive care unit stay, readmission to intensive care unit, and length of hospitalization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All of the 394 patients randomized (median age, 6 months; 47.2% boys) completed the trial. The primary end point occurred in 74 patients (38.1%) in the dexamethasone group vs 91 patients (45.5%) in the control group (absolute risk reduction, 7.4%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 15.3%; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.10; P = .20). Of the 17 prespecified secondary end points, none showed a statistically significant difference between groups. Infections occurred in 4 patients (2.0%) in the dexamethasone group vs 3 patients (1.5%) in the control group.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among infants younger than 12 months undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, intraoperative administration of dexamethasone, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce major complications and mortality at 30 days. However, the study may have been underpowered to detect a clinically important difference.

Association of Urine Biomarkers of Kidney Tubule Injury and Dysfunction With Frailty Index and Cognitive Function in Persons With CKD in SPRINT.,"Lindsay M Miller, Dena Rifkin, Alexandra K Lee, Manjula Kurella Tamura, Nicholas M Pajewski, Daniel E Weiner, Tala Al-Rousan, Michael Shlipak, Joachim H Ix, Lindsay M Milleret al.",2021 Oct,Am J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33647393/,No keywords found,"Rationale & objective:
        
      
      The associations of the glomerular markers of kidney disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria, with frailty and cognition are well established. However, the relationship of kidney tubule injury and dysfunction with frailty and cognition is unknown.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Observational cross-sectional study.
    


          Setting & participants:
        
      
      2,253 participants with eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2 in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).
    


          Exposure:
        
      
      Eight urine biomarkers: interleukin 18 (IL-18), kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), α1-microglobulin (A1M), β2-microglobulin (B2M), and uromodulin (Umod).
    


          Outcome:
        
      
      Frailty was measured using a previously validated frailty index (FI), categorized as fit (FI≤0.10), less fit (0.10<FI≤0.21), and frail (FI>0.21). Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
    


          Analytical approach:
        
      
      Associations between kidney tubule biomarkers with categorical FI were evaluated using multinomial logistic regression with the fit group as the reference. Cognitive function was evaluated using linear regression. Models were adjusted for demographic, behavioral, and clinical variables including eGFR and urine albumin.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Three of the 8 urine biomarkers of tubule injury and dysfunction were independently associated with FI. Each 2-fold higher level of urine KIM-1, a marker of tubule injury, was associated with a 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01-1.49) greater odds of being in the frail group. MCP-1, a marker of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, was associated with a 1.30 (95% CI, 1.04-1.64) greater odds of being in the frail group, and A1M, a marker of tubule reabsorptive capacity, was associated with a 1.48 (95% CI, 1.11-1.96) greater odds of being in the frail group. These associations were independent of confounders including eGFR and urine albumin, and were stronger than those of urine albumin with FI (1.15 [95% CI, 0.99-1.34]). Higher urine B2M, another marker of tubule reabsorptive capacity, was associated with worse cognitive scores at baseline (β: -0.09 [95% CI, -0.17 to-0.01]). Urine albumin was not associated with cognitive function.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Cross-sectional design, and FI may not be generalizable in other populations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Urine biomarkers of tubule injury, fibrosis, and proximal tubule reabsorptive capacity are variably associated with FI and worse cognition, independent of glomerular markers of kidney health. Future studies are needed to validate these results among other patient populations."

          Methods:
        
      
      Thirteen patients with pararenal or extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms were prospectively enrolled at five U.S sites and one non-U.S. site from 2014 to 2016. The TAMBE included four portals with either retrograde or antegrade renal portal configuration and used GORE VIABAHN Balloon-Expandable Endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore & Associates) for stenting of the renal and mesenteric arteries. The primary end point was procedural safety at 30 days, defined by absence of major adverse events, including any-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, paraplegia, bowel ischemia, respiratory failure, severe acute kidney injury (>50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate), dialysis, and procedural blood loss >1000 mL.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 11 male and two female patients with a mean age of 69 ± 8 years. Mean aneurysm diameter was 61 ± 13 mm. A total of 52 renal and mesenteric arteries were incorporated (4 vessels/patient). Technical success was achieved in 12 patients (92%). One patient had inadvertent occlusion of a right renal artery due to dissection. There was no mortality, aneurysm rupture, conversion to open repair, dialysis, or spinal cord injury. Mean length of hospital stay was 5 ± 3 days. At 30 days, four patients (31%) had major adverse events, all due to procedural blood loss >1000 mL. One patient had a type I endoleak at the distal renal branch, which was successfully treated by placement of an additional renal stent before dismissal. Computed tomography angiography at 30 days showed patent target vessels and no type I or type III endoleak.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study confirms the early feasibility of the TAMBE for treatment of pararenal and extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. The high technical success, no mortality, and low morbidity rate support continuation of clinical investigation in a larger population of patients."

      The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of the SAPIEN XT versus SAPIEN systems (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) in patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (AS) who were not candidates for surgery.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the standard of care for inoperable patients with severe, symptomatic AS. In the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) IB trial, a reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in patients undergoing TAVR with the balloon-expandable SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve compared with standard therapy, but the SAPIEN valve was associated with adverse periprocedural complications, including vascular complications, major bleeding, and paravalvular regurgitation. The newer, low-profile SAPIEN XT system was developed to reduce these adverse events.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 560 patients were enrolled at 28 sites in the United States from April 2011 to February 2012. Patients were randomized to receive the SAPIEN or SAPIEN XT systems. The primary endpoint was a nonhierarchical composite of all-cause mortality, major stroke, and rehospitalization at 1 year in the intention-to-treat population, assessed by noninferiority testing. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included cardiovascular death, New York Heart Association functional class, myocardial infarction, stroke, acute kidney injury, vascular complications, bleeding, 6-min walk distance, and valve performance (by echocardiography).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Both overall and major vascular complications were higher at 30 days in patients undergoing TAVR with SAPIEN compared with SAPIEN XT (overall: 22.1% vs. 15.5%; p = 0.04; major: 15.2% vs. 9.5%; p = 0.04). Bleeding requiring blood transfusions was also more frequent with SAPIEN compared with SAPIEN XT (10.6% vs. 5.3%; p = 0.02). At 1-year follow-up, the nonhierarchical composite of all-cause mortality, major stroke, or rehospitalization was similar (37.7% SAPIEN vs. 37.2% SAPIEN XT; noninferiority p value <0.002); no differences in the other major pre-specified endpoints were found.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In inoperable patients with severe, symptomatic AS, the lower-profile SAPIEN XT is noninferior to SAPIEN with fewer vascular complications and a lesser need for blood transfusion. (The PARTNER II Trial: Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER Valves; NCT01314313)."
Association of fibrinolysis phenotype with patient outcomes following traumatic brain injury.,"Samantha Durbin, Alexandra Brito, Alicia Johnson, Bryan Cotton, Susan Rowell, Martin A Schreiber, Samantha Durbinet al.",2024 Mar 1,J Trauma Acute Care Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37700441/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Impaired coagulation is associated with elevated risk of mortality in trauma patients. Prior studies have demonstrated increased mortality in patients with hyperfibrinolysis (HF) and fibrinolysis shutdown (SD). In addition, prior studies have demonstrated no effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) on fibrinolysis phenotypes. We examined the association of admission fibrinolysis phenotype with traumatic brain injury (TBI) patient outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were extracted from a placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial. Patients ≥15 years with TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score, 3-12) and systolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg were randomized in the out-of-hospital setting to receive placebo bolus/placebo infusion (Placebo), 1 gram (g) TXA bolus/1 g TXA infusion (bolus maintenance [BM]); or 2 g TXA bolus/placebo infusion (bolus only [BO]). Fibrinolysis phenotypes on admission were determined by clot lysis at 30 minutes (LY30): SD, ≤0.8%; physiologic, 0.9% to 2.9%; HF, ≥3%. Logistic regression was used to control for age, sex, penetrating injury, Injury Severity Score, maximum head AIS, and TXA treatment group.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seven hundred forty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. Fibrinolysis shutdown was the most common phenotype in all treatment groups and was associated with increased age, Injury Severity Score, and presence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Inpatient mortality was 15.2% for SD and HF, and 10.6% for physiologic ( p = 0.49). No differences in mortality, disability rating scale at 6 months, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or multi-organ failure were noted between fibrinolysis phenotypes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      SD is the most common phenotype expressed in moderate to severe TBI. In TBI, there is no association between fibrinolysis phenotype and mortality or other major complications.

Incidence and prognostic impact of bleeding and transfusion after coronary surgery in low-risk patients.,"Eeva-Maija Kinnunen, Marisa De Feo, Daniel Reichart, Tuomas Tauriainen, Giuseppe Gatti, Francesco Onorati, Luca Maschietto, Ciro Bancone, Francesca Fiorentino, Sidney Chocron, Karl Bounader, Magnus Dalén, Peter Svenarud, Giuseppe Faggian, Ilaria Franzese, Giuseppe Santarpino, Theodor Fischlein, Daniele Maselli, Carmelo Dominici, Saverio Nardella, Riccardo Gherli, Francesco Musumeci, Antonino S Rubino, Carmelo Mignosa, Giovanni Mariscalco, Filiberto G Serraino, Francesco Santini, Antonio Salsano, Francesco Nicolini, Tiziano Gherli, Marco Zanobini, Matteo Saccocci, Vito G Ruggieri, Jean Philippe Verhoye, Andrea Perrotti, Fausto Biancari, Eeva-Maija Kinnunenet al.",2017 Jan,Transfusion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27774615/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Excessive bleeding and blood transfusion are associated with adverse outcome after cardiac surgery, but their mechanistic effects are difficult to disentangle in patients with increased operative risk. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and prognostic impact of bleeding and transfusion of blood products in low-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
    


          Study design and methods:
        
      
      Sixteen tertiary European centers of cardiac surgery contributed to the prospective European registry of CABG (E-CABG). The severity of bleeding was defined by the E-CABG bleeding severity classification and universal definition of perioperative bleeding (UDPB) classification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 1213 patients with EuroSCORE II of less than 2% (mean, 1.1 ± 0.4%), 18.5% suffered from mild bleeding (E-CABG bleeding Grade 1) and 3.4% experienced severe bleeding (E-CABG bleeding Grade 2-3). Similarly, 19.7% had UDPB Class 2 and 5.9% had UDPB Classes 3 and 4. Mild and severe bleeding defined by the E-CABG and UDPB classifications were associated with an increased risk of several adverse events as adjusted by multiple covariates. The risk of death, stroke, and acute kidney injury was particularly increased in patients with severe bleeding.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Severe bleeding is rather uncommon in low-risk patients undergoing CABG, but it is associated with an increased risk of major adverse events. Prevention of excessive perioperative bleeding and patient blood management may improve the outcome of cardiac surgery also in low-risk patients."
Atorvastatin for reduction of 28-day mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients: a randomized controlled trial.,"Naglaa Hamdi Eltahan#, Neamat Hamdy Elsawy#, Kholoud M Abdelaaty#, Amal Salah Elhamaky, Ahmed H Hassan, Moataz Maher Emara, Naglaa Hamdi Eltahanet al.",2024 Feb 22,Respir Res,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38389078/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      COVID-19 is an abnormal host response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is associated with endothelial dysfunction and multi-organ failure. Atorvastatin has been proposed to reduce COVID-19 severity and mortality in chronic and de-novo users.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This randomized double-blind trial included 220 COVID-19 patients admitted to Mansoura University's isolation hospital in Egypt. One hundred and ten cases were given 40 mg of atorvastatin once daily for 28 days (group A), while 110 received a placebo (group B). All patients received treatment as per hospital protocol. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at 28 days. We also tracked 6-month mortality, time to clinical improvement, the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, potential adverse events, and hospital and intensive care length of stay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The 28-day all-cause mortality was 52/104 (50%) in group A vs. 54/103 (52.4%) in group B, odds ratio (OR) = 0.907 (0.526, 1.565), P = 0.727; adjusted OR = 0.773 (0.407, 1.47), P = 0.433. Six-month mortality occurred in 53/102 (52%) and 59/79 (60.8%) in group A vs. B, respectively, P = 0.208. Among hospital survivors in group A vs. group B, the median time to clinical improvement was 10 days (7-14) vs. 10 (7-15), P = 0.715; the duration of hospital stay was 10 days (7-14) vs. 10 (8-17), P = 0.378. Discontinuation was higher in group B (four vs. one), but statistically insignificant, P = 0.369.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In adults with severe or critical COVID-19, atorvastatin did not reduce the risk of 28-day or 6-month mortality and did not shorten the length of hospital stay or time to clinical improvement.

Terlipressin improves renal function in some patients with HRS-1, while liver transplantation (LT) is a curative treatment for advanced chronic liver disease. Renal failure post-LT requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a major risk factor for graft and patient survival. A post hoc analysis with a 12-month follow-up of LT recipients from a placebo-controlled trial of terlipressin (CONFIRM; NCT02770716) was conducted to evaluate the need for RRT and overall survival. Patients with HRS-1 were treated with terlipressin plus albumin or placebo plus albumin for up to 14 days. RRT was defined as any type of procedure that replaced kidney function. Outcomes compared between groups included the incidence of HRS-1 reversal, the need for RRT (pretransplant and posttransplant), and overall survival. Of the 300 patients in CONFIRM (terlipressin n = 199; placebo, n = 101), 70 (23%) underwent LT alone (terlipressin, n = 43; placebo, n = 27) and 5 had simultaneous liver-kidney transplant (terlipressin, n = 3, placebo, n = 2). The rate of HRS reversal was significantly higher in the terlipressin group compared with the placebo group (37%, n = 16 vs. 15%, n = 4; p = 0.033). The pretransplant need for RRT was significantly lower among those who received terlipressin ( p = 0.007). The posttransplant need for RRT, at 12 months, was significantly lower among those patients who received terlipressin and were alive at Day 365, compared to placebo ( p = 0.009).

      Immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplantation is associated with numerous toxicities. CD28-mediated T-cell costimulation blockade using belatacept may reduce long-term nephrotoxicity, compared with calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression. The efficacy and safety of simultaneous calcineurin inhibitor avoidance and rapid steroid withdrawal were tested in a randomized, prospective, multicenter study.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      This study reports the 2-year results of a randomized clinical trial of 316 recipients of a new kidney transplant. All kidney transplants were performed using rapid steroid withdrawal immunosuppression. Recipients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive belatacept with alemtuzumab induction, belatacept with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) induction, or tacrolimus with rATG induction. The composite end point consisted of death, kidney allograft loss, or an eGFR of <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at 2 years.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The composite end point was observed for 11 of 107 (10%) participants assigned to belatacept/alemtuzumab, 13 of 104 (13%) participants assigned to belatacept/rATG, and 21 of 105 (21%) participants assigned to tacrolimus/rATG (for belatacept/alemtuzumab versus tacrolimus/rATG, P=0.99; for belatacept/rATG versus tacrolimus/rATG, P=0.66). Patient and graft survival rates were similar between all groups. An eGFR of <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was observed for nine of 107 (8%) participants assigned to belatacept/alemtuzuab, eight of 104 (8%) participants assigned to belatacept/rATG, and 20 of 105 (19%) participants assigned to tacrolimus/rATG (P<0.05 for each belatacept group versus tacrolimus/rATG). Biopsy sample-proven acute rejection was observed for 20 of 107 (19%) participants assigned to belatacept/alemtuzuab, 26 of 104 (25%) participants assigned to belatacept/rATG, and seven of 105 (7%) participants assigned to tacrolimus/rATG (for belatacept/alemtuzumab versus tacrolimus/rATG, P=0.006; for belatacept/rATG versus tacrolimus/rATG, P<0.001). Gastrointestinal and neurologic adverse events were less frequent with belatacept versus calcineurin-based immunosuppression.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall 2-year outcomes were similar when comparing maintenance immunosuppression using belatacept versus tacrolimus, and each protocol involved rapid steroid withdrawal. The incidence of an eGFR of <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was significantly lower with belatacept compared with tacrolimus, but the incidence of biopsy sample-proven acute rejection significantly higher.

      Minimizing the use of blood component can reduce known and unknown blood transfusion risks, preserve blood bank resources, and decrease healthcare costs. Red Blood Cell (RBC) transfusion is common after cardiac surgery and associated with adverse perioperative outcomes, including mortality. Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) may reduce bleeding and the need for blood product transfusion after cardiac surgery. However, its blood-saving effect and impact on major outcomes remain uncertain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a single-blinded, multinational, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio conducted in Tertiary and University hospitals. The study is designed to enroll patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with planned cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients are randomized to receive ANH before CPB or the best available treatment without ANH. We identified an ANH volume of at least 650 ml as the critical threshold for clinically relevant benefits. Larger ANH volumes, however, are allowed and tailored to the patient's characteristics and clinical conditions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The primary outcome is the percentage of patients receiving RBCs transfusion from randomization until hospital discharge, which we hypothesize will be reduced from 35% to 28% with ANH. Secondary outcomes are all-cause 30-day mortality, acute kidney injury, bleeding complications, and ischemic complications.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The trial is designed to determine whether ANH can safely reduce RBC transfusion after elective cardiac surgery with CPB.

Peritoneal Dialysis vs Furosemide for Prevention of Fluid Overload in Infants After Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"David M Kwiatkowski, Stuart L Goldstein, David S Cooper, David P Nelson, David L S Morales, Catherine D Krawczeski, David M Kwiatkowskiet al.",2017 Apr 1,JAMA Pediatr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28241247/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      Fluid overload after congenital heart surgery is frequent and a major cause of morbidity and mortality among infants. Many programs have adopted the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) for fluid management; however, its benefits compared with those of traditional diuretic administration are unknown.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether infants randomized to PD vs furosemide for the treatment of oliguria have a higher incidence of negative fluid balance on postoperative day 1, as well as avoidance of 10% fluid overload; shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, and inotrope use; and fewer electrolyte abnormalities.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This single-center, unblinded, randomized clinical trial compared methods of fluid removal after cardiac surgery from October 1, 2011, through March 13, 2015, in a large tertiary pediatric hospital in Ohio. The parents or guardians of all eligible infants (aged <6 months) undergoing cardiac surgery with catheter placement for PD were approached for inclusion. No patients were withdrawn for adverse effects. Recruitment was powered for the primary outcome, and analysis was based on intention to treat. Patients randomized to PD were hypothesized to have superior outcomes.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Infants received intravenous furosemide (1 mg/kg every 6 hours) or a standardized PD regimen.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary end point was incidence of negative fluid balance on postoperative day 1. Secondary end points included incidence of fluid overload, duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay, electrolyte abnormalities and repletion doses, duration of inotropic administration, and mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-three patients (47 boys [64%] and 26 girls [35%]; median age, 8 [interquartile range (IQR), 6-14] days) received treatment and completed the trial. No difference was found between the PD and furosemide groups in the incidence of negative fluid balance on the first postoperative day. The furosemide group was 3 times more likely to have 10% fluid overload (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3-6.9), was more likely to have prolonged ventilator use (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2-8.2), and had a longer duration of inotrope use (median, 5.5 [IQR, 4-8] vs 4.0 [IQR, 3-6] days) and higher electrolyte abnormality scores (median, 6 [IQR, 4-7] vs 3 [IQR, 2-5]) compared with the PD group. No statistically significant differences in mortality (3 patients [9.4%] in the furosemide group vs 1 patient [3.1%] in the PD group) or length of cardiac intensive care unit (median, 7 [IQR, 6-12] vs 9 [IQR, 5-15] days) or hospital (15 [IQR, 10-28] vs 14 [IQR, 9-22] days) stay were observed. No serious complications were observed. Dialysis was discontinued early in 9 of 41 patients in the PD group for pleural-peritoneal communication.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Use of PD is safe and allows for superior fluid management with improved clinical outcomes compared with diuretic administration. Use of PD should be strongly considered among infants at high risk for postoperative acute kidney injury and fluid overload.

      To assess whether pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) modified the relationship between the strategy for renal-replacement theraphy (RRT) initiation and clinical outcomes in the STARRT-AKI trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a secondary analysis of a multi-national randomized trial. We included patients who had documented pre-existing estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) data prior to hospitalization, and we defined CKD as an eGFR ≤ 59 mL/min/1.73 m2. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included RRT dependence and RRT-free days at 90 days. We used logistic and linear regression and interaction testing to explore the effect of RRT initiation strategy on outcomes by CKD status.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We studied 1121 patients who had pre-hospital measures of kidney function. Of these, 432 patients (38.5%) had CKD. The median (IQR) baseline serum creatinine was 130 (114-160) and 76 (64-90) µmol/L for those with and without CKD, respectively. Patients with CKD were older and more likely to have cardiovascular comorbidities and diabetes mellitus. Patients with CKD had higher 90-day mortality (47% vs. 40%, p < 0.001) compared to those without CKD, though this was not significant after covariate adjustment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.79-1.41). Patients with CKD were more likely to remain RRT dependent at 90 days (14% vs. 8%; aOR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.05-3.43). CKD status did not modify the effect of RRT initiation strategy on 90-day mortality. Among patients with CKD, allocation to the accelerated strategy conferred more than threefold greater odds of RRT dependence at 90 days (aOR 3.18; 95% CI, 1.41-7.91) compared with the standard strategy, whereas RRT initiation strategy had no effect on this outcome among those without CKD (aOR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.34-1.47, p value for interaction, 0.009).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this secondary analysis of the STARRT-AKI trial, an accelerated strategy of RRT initiation conferred a higher risk of 90-day RRT dependence among patients with pre-existing CKD; however, no effect was observed in the absence of CKD."

      Eligible patients in this multi-centre, prospective, consecutively enrolled, non-randomised, clinical trial, received transcatheter aortic valve replacement via femoral artery access. Follow-up visits were at discharge, 30 days, and 6, 12, and 24 months. The primary endpoint was Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 composite safety at 30 days: all-cause mortality, all stroke, life-threatening bleeding, acute kidney injury-Stage 3, coronary artery obstruction requiring intervention, major vascular complication, and valve-related dysfunction requiring repeat procedure. Other endpoints were device success (successful vascular access, delivery, and deployment; correct position; intended performance mean aortic valve gradient <20 mmHg, mild or less paravalvular aortic regurgitation [PAR]; and only one valve implanted) and New York Heart Association functional class (NYHA).

"The Infant KIdney Dialysis and Utrafiltration (I-KID) Study: A Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomized Study in Infants, Comparing Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration, and Newcastle Infant Dialysis Ultrafiltration System, a Novel Infant Hemodialysis Device.","Heather Lambert, Shaun Hiu, Malcolm G Coulthard, John N S Matthews, Eva-Maria Holstein, Jean Crosier, Rachel Agbeko, Thomas Brick, Heather Duncan, David Grant, Quen Mok, Andrew Gustaf Nyman, John Pappachan, Chris Boucher, Joe Bulmer, Denise Chisholm, Kirsten Cromie, Victoria Emmet, Richard G Feltbower, Arunoday Ghose, Michael Grayling, Rebecca Harrison, Ciara A Kennedy, Elaine McColl, Kevin Morris, Lee Norman, Julie Office, Roger Parslow, Christine Pattinson, Shriya Sharma, Jonathan Smith, Alison Steel, Rachel Steel, Jayne Straker, Lamprini Vrana, Jenn Walker, Paul Wellman, Mike Whitaker, Jim Wightman, Nina Wilson, Lucy Wirz, Ruth Wood, Heather Lambertet al.",2023 Jul 1,Pediatr Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36892305/,No keywords found,"Objectives:
        
      
      Renal replacement therapy (RRT) options are limited for small babies because of lack of available technology. We investigated the precision of ultrafiltration, biochemical clearances, clinical efficacy, outcomes, and safety profile for a novel non-Conformité Européenne-marked hemodialysis device for babies under 8 kg, the Newcastle Infant Dialysis Ultrafiltration System (NIDUS), compared with the current options of peritoneal dialysis (PD) or continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
    


          Design:
        
      
      Nonblinded cluster-randomized cross-sectional stepped-wedge design with four periods, three sequences, and two clusters per sequence.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Clusters were six U.K. PICUs.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Babies less than 8 kg requiring RRT for fluid overload or biochemical disturbance.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      In controls, RRT was delivered by PD or CVVH, and in interventions, NIDUS was used. The primary outcome was precision of ultrafiltration compared with prescription; secondary outcomes included biochemical clearances.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      At closure, 97 participants were recruited from the six PICUs (62 control and 35 intervention). The primary outcome, obtained from 62 control and 21 intervention patients, showed that ultrafiltration with NIDUS was closer to that prescribed than with control: sd controls, 18.75, intervention, 2.95 (mL/hr); adjusted ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.71; p = 0.018. Creatinine clearance was smallest and least variable for PD (mean, sd ) = (0.08, 0.03) mL/min/kg, larger for NIDUS (0.46, 0.30), and largest for CVVH (1.20, 0.72). Adverse events were reported in all groups. In this critically ill population with multiple organ failure, mortality was lowest for PD and highest for CVVH, with NIDUS in between.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      NIDUS delivers accurate, controllable fluid removal and adequate clearances, indicating that it has important potential alongside other modalities for infant RRT."
Comparing clinical judgment with the MySurgeryRisk algorithm for preoperative risk assessment: A pilot usability study.,"Meghan Brennan, Sahil Puri, Tezcan Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Zheng Feng, Matthew Ruppert, Haleh Hashemighouchani, Petar Momcilovic, Xiaolin Li, Daisy Zhe Wang, Azra Bihorac, Meghan Brennanet al.",2019 May,Surgery,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30792011/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Major postoperative complications are associated with increased cost and mortality. The complexity of electronic health records overwhelms physicians' abilities to use the information for optimal and timely preoperative risk assessment. We hypothesized that data-driven, predictive-risk algorithms implemented in an intelligent decision-support platform simplify and augment physicians' risk assessments.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 20 physicians at a quaternary academic medical center compared the usability and accuracy of preoperative risk assessment between physicians and MySurgeryRisk, a validated, machine-learning algorithm, using a simulated workflow for the real-time, intelligent decision-support platform. We used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to compare the accuracy of physicians' risk assessment for six postoperative complications before and after interaction with the algorithm for 150 clinical cases.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the MySurgeryRisk algorithm ranged between 0.73 and 0.85 and was significantly better than physicians' initial risk assessments (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.47 and 0.69) for all postoperative complications except cardiovascular. After interaction with the algorithm, the physicians significantly improved their risk assessment for acute kidney injury and for an intensive care unit admission greater than 48 hours, resulting in a net improvement of reclassification of 12% and 16%, respectively. Physicians rated the algorithm as easy to use and useful.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Implementation of a validated, MySurgeryRisk computational algorithm for real-time predictive analytics with data derived from the electronic health records to augment physicians' decision-making is feasible and accepted by physicians. Early involvement of physicians as key stakeholders in both design and implementation of this technology will be crucial for its future success."
MicroRNA-21 in glomerular injury.,"Jennifer Y Lai, Jinghui Luo, Christopher O'Connor, Xiaohong Jing, Viji Nair, Wenjun Ju, Ann Randolph, Iddo Z Ben-Dov, Regina N Matar, Daniel Briskin, Jiri Zavadil, Robert G Nelson, Thomas Tuschl, Frank C Brosius rd, Matthias Kretzler, Markus Bitzer, Jennifer Y Laiet al.",2015 Apr,J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25145934/,"TGF-β, cell survival, diabetic glomerulopathy, molecular biology, podocyte.","TGF-β(1) is a pleotropic growth factor that mediates glomerulosclerosis and podocyte apoptosis, hallmarks of glomerular diseases. The expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21) is regulated by TGF-β(1), and miR-21 inhibits apoptosis in cancer cells. TGF-β(1)-transgenic mice exhibit accelerated podocyte loss and glomerulosclerosis. We determined that miR-21 expression increases rapidly in cultured murine podocytes after exposure to TGF-β(1) and is higher in kidneys of TGF-β(1)-transgenic mice than wild-type mice. miR-21-deficient TGF-β(1)-transgenic mice showed increased proteinuria and glomerular extracellular matrix deposition and fewer podocytes per glomerular tuft compared with miR-21 wild-type TGF-β(1)-transgenic littermates. Similarly, miR-21 expression was increased in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, and loss of miR-21 in these mice was associated with increased albuminuria, podocyte depletion, and mesangial expansion. In cultured podocytes, inhibition of miR-21 was accompanied by increases in the rate of cell death, TGF-β/Smad3-signaling activity, and expression of known proapoptotic miR-21 target genes p53, Pdcd4, Smad7, Tgfbr2, and Timp3. In American-Indian patients with diabetic nephropathy (n=48), albumin-to-creatinine ratio was positively associated with miR-21 expression in glomerular fractions (r=0.6; P<0.001) but not tubulointerstitial fractions (P=0.80). These findings suggest that miR-21 ameliorates TGF-β(1) and hyperglycemia-induced glomerular injury through repression of proapoptotic signals, thereby inhibiting podocyte loss. This finding is in contrast to observations in murine models of tubulointerstitial kidney injury but consistent with findings in cancer models. The aggravation of glomerular disease in miR-21-deficient mice and the positive association with albumin-to-creatinine ratio in patients with diabetic nephropathy support miR-21 as a feedback inhibitor of TGF-β signaling and functions."

Methods and Results In ISCHEMIA-CKD (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches-Chronic Kidney Disease), 777 participants with advanced CKD and moderate or severe ischemia were randomized to either an initial invasive or conservative management strategy. Herein, we compare the proportion of randomized participants with non-dialysis-requiring CKD at baseline (n=362) who initiated dialysis and compare the time to dialysis initiation between invasive versus conservative management arms. Using multivariable Cox regression analysis, we also sought to identify the effect of invasive versus conservative chronic coronary disease management strategies on dialysis initiation. At a median follow-up of 23 months (25th-75th interquartile range, 14-32 months), dialysis was initiated in 18.9% of participants (36/190) in the invasive strategy and 16.9% of participants (29/172) in the conservative strategy (P=0.22). The median time to dialysis initiation was 6.0 months (interquartile range, 3.0-16.0 months) in the invasive group and 18.2 months (interquartile range, 12.2-25.0 months) in the conservative group (P=0.004), with no difference in procedural acute kidney injury rates between the groups (7.8% versus 5.4%; P=0.26). Baseline clinical factors associated with earlier dialysis initiation were lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (hazard ratio [HR] associated with 5-unit decrease, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.72-2.56]; P<0.001), diabetes (HR, 2.30 [95% CI, 1.28-4.13]; P=0.005), hypertension (HR, 7.97 [95% CI, 1.09-58.21]; P=0.041), and Hispanic ethnicity (HR, 2.34 [95% CI, 1.22-4.47]; P=0.010). Conclusions In participants with non-dialysis-requiring CKD in ISCHEMIA-CKD, randomization to an invasive chronic coronary disease management strategy (relative to a conservative chronic coronary disease management strategy) is associated with an accelerated time to initiation of maintenance dialysis for kidney failure.

Angiopoietin-2 in acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock--a biomarker substudy of the IABP-SHOCK II-Trial.,"Janine Pöss, Georg Fuernau, Daniel Denks, Steffen Desch, Ingo Eitel, Suzanne de Waha, Andreas Link, Gerhard Schuler, Volker Adams, Michael Böhm, Holger Thiele, Janine Pösset al.",2015 Nov,Eur J Heart Fail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26333723/,No keywords found,"Aims:
        
      
      Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a mediator of capillary leakage, and increased Ang-2 levels were associated with poor in-hospital outcome in a pilot study in cardiogenic shock (CS). In this larger study, we followed this hypothesis and aimed at assessing the predictive role of Ang-2 on short- and long-term mortality, investigating the effect of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) treatment on Ang-2 levels, and identifying clinical and procedural predictors of increased Ang-2.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      In the IABP-SHOCK II-trial, 600 patients with CS complicating acute myocardial infarction were assigned to therapy with or without IABP. This substudy included 189 randomized patients with serial blood sampling performed at days 1, 2, and 3. No significant differences in Ang-2 levels were found between patients with or without IABP. The Ang-2 levels above the median at day 1 were associated with 30-day [hazard ratio (HR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-3.10, P = 0.002) and 1-year mortality (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.49-3.27, P < 0.001). Stratification of patients according to Ang-2 levels at day 3 increased these associations (30 days HR 5.15, 95% CI 2.80-9.45, P < 0.001; 1 year HR 5.24, 95% CI 3.19-8.58, P < 0.001). The Ang-2 concentrations were independent predictors for mortality in multivariate analysis (30 days HR 4.82, 95% CI 1.52-15.23, P = 0.007; 1 year HR 2.01, 95%CI 1.24-3.24, P = 0.005). Predictors of increased Ang-2 levels at day 3 were baseline Ang-2, development of acute kidney injury, bleeding events or transfusion, and impaired reperfusion.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In CS, high levels of Ang-2 are independently associated with poor short- and long-term outcome and associated with the reperfusion success as well as complications.

      To assess clinical and biochemical measurements that can identify people with dysglycaemia (i.e. diabetes or pre-diabetes) who remain free of serious outcomes during follow-up.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We conducted exploratory analyses using data from the Outcomes Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) study to identify independent determinants of outcome-free status in 12 537 middle-aged and older adults with prediabetes and early type 2 diabetes from 40 countries. Serious outcome-free status was defined as the absence of major cardiovascular outcomes, kidney or retinal outcomes, peripheral artery disease, dementia, cancer, any hospitalization, or death during follow-up.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 3328 (26.6%) participants remained free of serious outcomes during a median follow-up of 6.2 years (IQR 5.8, 6.7). Independent clinical determinants of outcome-free status included younger age, female sex, non-White ethnicity, shorter diabetes duration, absence of previous cardiovascular disease, current or former smokers, higher grip strength, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and ankle-brachial index, lower body mass index and kidney disease index, and non-use of renin-angiotensin system drugs and beta-blockers. In a subset of 8401 people with baseline measurements of 238 biomarkers, growth differentiation factor 15, kidney injury molecule-1, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, uromodulin, C-reactive protein, factor VII and ferritin were independent determinants. The combination of clinical determinants and biomarkers best identified participants who remained outcome-free (C-statistics 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.70-0.73; net reclassification improvement 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.48-0.58).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A set of routinely measured clinical characteristics and seven protein biomarkers identify middle-aged and older people with prediabetes or early type 2 diabetes as least likely to experience serious outcomes during follow-up."

      Across guidelines, protein dosing for critically ill patients with obesity varies considerably. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate whether this population would benefit from higher doses of protein.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A post hoc subgroup analysis of the effect of higher protein dosing in critically ill patients with high nutritional risk (EFFORT Protein): an international, multicenter, pragmatic, registry-based randomized trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Eighty-five adult ICUs across 16 countries.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Patients with obesity defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 ( n = 425).
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      In the primary study, patients were randomized into a high-dose (≥ 2.2 g/kg/d) or usual-dose protein group (≤ 1.2 g/kg/d).
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      Protein intake was monitored for up to 28 days, and outcomes (time to discharge alive [TTDA], 60-d mortality, days of mechanical ventilation [MV], hospital, and ICU length of stay [LOS]) were recorded until 60 days post-randomization. Of the 1301 patients in the primary study, 425 had a BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 . After adjusting for sites and covariates, we observed a nonsignificant slower rate of TTDA with higher protein that ruled out a clinically important benefit (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58-1.05; p = 0.10). We found no evidence of difference in TTDA between protein groups when subgroups with different classes of obesity or patients with and without various nutritional and frailty risk variables were examined, even after the removal of patients with baseline acute kidney injury. Overall, 60-day mortality rates were 31.5% and 28.2% in the high protein and usual protein groups, respectively (risk difference, 3.3%; 95% CI, -5.4 to 12.1; p = 0.46). Duration of MV and LOS in hospital and ICU were not significantly different between groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In critically ill patients with obesity, higher protein doses did not improve clinical outcomes, including those with higher nutritional and frailty risk."
Cohort profile of PLUTO: a perioperative biobank focusing on prediction and early diagnosis of postoperative complications.,"Nikki de Mul, Diede Verlaan, Jelle P Ruurda, Wilhelmina M U van Grevenstein, Jeroen Hagendoorn, Gert-Jan de Borst, Menno R Vriens, Remco de Bree, Ronald P Zweemer, Charles Vogely, Jelle L G Haitsma Mulier, Lisette M Vernooij, Johannes B Reitsma, Marcel R de Zoete, Janetta Top, Jan A J Kluijtmans, Imo E Hoefer, Peter Noordzij, Thijs Rettig, Marije Marsman, Anne Marie G A de Smet, Lennie Derde, Judith van Waes, Mienke Rijsdijk, Willem Jan M Schellekens, Marc J M Bonten, Arjen J C Slooter, Olaf L Cremer, Nikki de Mulet al.",2023 Apr 19,BMJ Open,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37076142/,No keywords found,"Purpose:
        
      
      Although elective surgery is generally safe, some procedures remain associated with an increased risk of complications. Improved preoperative risk stratification and earlier recognition of these complications may ameliorate postoperative recovery and improve long-term outcomes. The perioperative longitudinal study of complications and long-term outcomes (PLUTO) cohort aims to establish a comprehensive biorepository that will facilitate research in this field. In this profile paper, we will discuss its design rationale and opportunities for future studies.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Patients undergoing elective intermediate to high-risk non-cardiac surgery are eligible for enrolment. For the first seven postoperative days, participants are subjected to daily bedside visits by dedicated observers, who adjudicate clinical events and perform non-invasive physiological measurements (including handheld spirometry and single-channel electroencephalography). Blood samples and microbiome specimens are collected at preselected time points. Primary study outcomes are the postoperative occurrence of nosocomial infections, major adverse cardiac events, pulmonary complications, acute kidney injury and delirium/acute encephalopathy. Secondary outcomes include mortality and quality of life, as well as the long-term occurrence of psychopathology, cognitive dysfunction and chronic pain.
    


          Findings to date:
        
      
      Enrolment of the first participant occurred early 2020. During the inception phase of the project (first 2 years), 431 patients were eligible of whom 297 patients consented to participate (69%). Observed event rate was 42% overall, with the most frequent complication being infection.
    


          Future plans:
        
      
      The main purpose of the PLUTO biorepository is to provide a framework for research in the field of perioperative medicine and anaesthesiology, by storing high-quality clinical data and biomaterials for future studies. In addition, PLUTO aims to establish a logistical platform for conducting embedded clinical trials.

Intraoperative use of tranexamic acid to reduce blood loss during cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer: A randomized controlled clinical trial.,"Xijun Yang, Mao Chai, Lingfang Xia, Zhiyong He, Xiaohua Wu, Jun Zhang, Xijun Yanget al.",2023 Jul,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37029431/,No keywords found,"Introduction:
        
      
      Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss and allogeneic transfusion requirements in various surgical procedures. The role of tranexamic acid during cytoreductive procedures in advanced ovarian cancer is not clear.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      This was a single center randomized, controlled, three-armed clinical trial. A total of 150 ovarian cancer patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery were recruited and assigned to three groups (n = 50/group): the control group (normal saline), low-dose group (10 mg/kg bolus + 1 mg/kg continuous infusion of tranexamic acid), and high-dose group (20 mg/kg bolus + 5 mg/kg continuous infusion of tranexamic acid). The primary endpoint was intraoperative blood loss volume and total blood loss volume, and secondary endpoints included intraoperative blood transfusion volumes, vasoactive agent consumption, admission into the intensive care unit, and incidence of postoperative complications within postoperative 30 days. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04360629.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The patients in the high-dose group had less intraoperative (median [IQR]: 625.3 mL [343.5-1210.5]) and total blood loss volume (748.9 mL [292.2-1650.2]) than those in the control group (1015.5 mL [679.4-1015.5], p = 0.012; and 1700.7 mL [458.7-2419.8], p = 0.004, respectively). In contrast, the intraoperative (992.5 mL [539.0-1404.0], p = 0.874) and total blood loss volume (1025.0 mL [381.8-1819.9], p = 0.113) was not significantly reduced in the low-dose group when compared with the control group. Correspondingly, the relative risk of blood transfusion (RR [95% CI], 0.405 [0.180-0.909], p = 0.028) was reduced in the high-dose group and required less intraoperative noradrenaline (881.0 ± 438.3 mg) to maintain stable hemodynamics than the control group (1548.0 ± 349.8 mg, p = 0.001). Furthermore, compared with the control group, the two tranexamic acid groups had decreased intensive care unit admission rates (p = 0.016) without increasing the incidence of postoperative seizure, acute kidney injury, and thromboembolism.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      High-dose tranexamic acid is more effective in reducing blood loss and blood transfusion without increasing the risk of postoperative complications. The high-dose regime tended to have a better risk-benefit profile."
Impact of propofol versus desflurane anesthesia on postoperative hepatic and renal functions in infants with living-related liver transplantation: a randomized controlled trial.,"Wei Liu#, Min Du#, Mingman Zhang, Xiaoke Dai, Haoming Wang, Ying Le, Shenshen Zhi, Lin Bo, Junjun Quan, Wei Liuet al.",2024 Sep 16,BMC Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39285414/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      The effects of anesthetics on liver and kidney functions after infantile living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or desflurane-based inhalation anesthesia on postoperative liver and kidney functions in infant recipients after LRLT and to evaluate hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seventy-six infants with congenital biliary atresia scheduled for LRLT were randomly divided into two anesthesia maintenance groups: group D with continuous inhalation of desflurane and group P with an infusion of propofol. The primary focus was to assess alterations of liver transaminase and serum creatinine (Scr) levels within the first 7 days after surgery. And the peak aminotransferase level within 72 h post-surgery was used as a surrogate marker for HIRI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no differences in preoperative hepatic and renal functions between the two groups. Upon the intensive care unit (ICU) arrival, the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST, P = 0.001) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT, P = 0.005) in group P were significantly lower than those in group D. These changes persisted until the fourth and sixth days after surgery. The peak AST and ALT levels within 72 h after surgery were also lower in group P than in group D (856 (552, 1221) vs. 1468 (732, 1969) U/L, P = 0.001 (95% CI: 161-777) and 517 (428, 704) vs. 730 (541, 1100) U/L, P = 0.006, (95% CI: 58-366), respectively). Patients in group P had lower levels of Scr upon the ICU arrival and on the first day after surgery, compared to group D (17.8 (15.2, 22.0) vs. 23.0 (20.8, 30.8) μmol/L, P < 0.001 (95% CI: 3.0-8.7) and 17.1 (14.9, 21.0) vs. 20.5 (16.5, 25.3) μmol/L, P = 0.02 (95% CI: 0.0-5.0) respectively). Moreover, the incidence of severe acute kidney injury was significantly lower in group P compared to that in group D (15.8% vs. 39.5%, P = 0.038).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Propofol-based TIVA might improve liver and kidney functions after LRLT in infants and reduce the incidence of serious complications, which may be related to the reduction of HIRI. However, further biomarkers will be necessary to prove these associations."
Effect of glycemic index and carbohydrate intake on kidney function in healthy adults.,"Stephen P Juraschek, Alex R Chang, Lawrence J Appel, Cheryl A M Anderson, Deidra C Crews, Letitia Thomas, Jeanne Charleston, Edgar R Miller rd, Stephen P Jurascheket al.",2016 Jul 8,BMC Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27391484/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Replacing carbohydrate with protein acutely increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR) but is associated with faster, long-term kidney disease progression. The effects of carbohydrate type (i.e. glycemic index, GI) on kidney function are unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted an ancillary study of a randomized, crossover feeding trial in overweight/obese adults without diabetes or kidney disease (N = 163). Participants were fed each of four healthy, DASH-like diets for 5 weeks, separated by 2-week washout periods. Weight was kept constant. The four diets were: high GI (GI ≥65) with high %carb (58 % kcal) (reference diet), low GI (≤45) with low %carb (40 % kcal), low GI with high %carb; and high GI with low %carb. Plasma was collected at baseline and after each feeding period. Study outcomes were cystatin C, β2-microglobulin (β2M), and estimated GFR based on cystatin C (eGFRcys).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean (SD) age was 52 (11) years; 52 % were women; 50 % were black. At baseline, mean (SD) cystatin C, β2M, and eGFRcys were 0.8 (0.1) mg/L, 1.9 (0.4) mg/L, and 104 (16) mL/min/1.73 m(2). Compared to the high GI/high %carb diet, reducing GI, %carb, or both increased eGFRcys by 1.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (95 % CI: 1.1, 2.7; P < 0.001), 3.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (1.9, 4.0; P < 0.001), and 4.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (3.5, 5.4; P < 0.001), respectively. Increases in eGFRcys from reducing GI were significantly associated with increases in eGFRcys from reducing %carb (P < 0.001). Results for cystatin C and β2M reflected eGFRcys.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Reducing GI increased GFR. Reducing %carb by increasing calories from protein and fat, also increased GFR. Future studies on GI should examine the long-term effects of this increase in GFR on kidney injury markers and clinical outcomes.

Effects of Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering on Kidney Tubule Injury in CKD: A Longitudinal Subgroup Analysis in SPRINT.,"Rakesh Malhotra, Timothy Craven, Walter T Ambrosius, Anthony A Killeen, William E Haley, Alfred K Cheung, Michel Chonchol, Mark Sarnak, Chirag R Parikh, Michael G Shlipak, Joachim H Ix                              ;, SPRINT Research Group, Rakesh Malhotraet al.",2019 Jan,Am J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291012/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Random assignment to the intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) arm (<120mmHg) in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) resulted in more rapid declines in estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) than in the standard arm (SBP<140mmHg). Whether this change reflects hemodynamic effects or accelerated intrinsic kidney damage is unknown.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Longitudinal subgroup analysis of clinical trial participants.
    


          Settings & participants:
        
      
      Random sample of SPRINT participants with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2 by the CKD-EPI (CKD Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine-cystatin C equation at baseline.
    


          Outcomes & measurements:
        
      
      Urine biomarkers of tubule function (β2-microglobulin [B2M], α1-microglobulin [A1M]), and uromodulin), injury (interleukin 18, kidney injury molecule 1, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), inflammation (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), and repair (human cartilage glycoprotein 40) at baseline, year 1, and year 4. Biomarkers were indexed to urine creatinine concentration and changes between arms were evaluated using mixed-effects linear models and an intention-to-treat approach.
    


          Results:
        
      
      978 SPRINT participants (519 in the intensive and 459 in the standard arm) with prevalent CKD were included. Mean age was 72±9 years and eGFR was 46.1±9.4mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline. Clinical characteristics, eGFR, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, and all 8 biomarker values were similar across arms at baseline. Compared to the standard arm, eGFR was lower by 2.9 and 3.3mL/min/1.73m2 in the intensive arm at year 1 and year 4. None of the 8 tubule marker levels was higher in the intensive arm compared to the standard arm at year 1 or year 4. Two tubule function markers (B2M and A1M) were 29% (95% CI, 10%-43%) and 24% (95% CI, 10%-36%) lower at year 1 in the intensive versus standard arm, respectively.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Exclusion of persons with diabetes, and few participants had advanced CKD.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among participants with CKD in SPRINT, random assignment to the intensive SBP arm did not increase any levels of 8 urine biomarkers of tubule cell damage despite loss of eGFR. These findings support the hypothesis that eGFR declines in the intensive arm of SPRINT predominantly reflect hemodynamic changes rather than intrinsic damage to kidney tubule cells."
Effect of Intraoperative Low Tidal Volume vs Conventional Tidal Volume on Postoperative Pulmonary Complications in Patients Undergoing Major Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Dharshi Karalapillai, Laurence Weinberg, Philip Peyton, Louise Ellard, Raymond Hu, Brett Pearce, Chong O Tan, David Story, Mark O'Donnell, Patrick Hamilton, Chad Oughton, Jonathan Galtieri, Anthony Wilson, Ary Serpa Neto, Glenn Eastwood, Rinaldo Bellomo, Daryl A Jones, Dharshi Karalapillaiet al.",2020 Sep 1,JAMA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32870298/,No keywords found,"Importance:
        
      
      In patients who undergo mechanical ventilation during surgery, the ideal tidal volume is unclear.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether low-tidal-volume ventilation compared with conventional ventilation during major surgery decreases postoperative pulmonary complications.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Single-center, assessor-blinded, randomized clinical trial of 1236 patients older than 40 years undergoing major noncardiothoracic, nonintracranial surgery under general anesthesia lasting more than 2 hours in a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia, from February 2015 to February 2019. The last date of follow-up was February 17, 2019.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Patients were randomized to receive a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight (n = 614; low tidal volume group) or a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg predicted body weight (n = 592; conventional tidal volume group). All patients received positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cm H2O.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was a composite of postoperative pulmonary complications within the first 7 postoperative days, including pneumonia, bronchospasm, atelectasis, pulmonary congestion, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or unplanned requirement for postoperative invasive or noninvasive ventilation. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pulmonary complications including development of pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, acute kidney injury, wound infection (superficial and deep), rate of intraoperative need for vasopressor, incidence of unplanned intensive care unit admission, rate of need for rapid response team call, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 1236 patients who were randomized, 1206 (98.9%) completed the trial (mean age, 63.5 years; 494 [40.9%] women; 681 [56.4%] undergoing abdominal surgery). The primary outcome occurred in 231 of 608 patients (38%) in the low tidal volume group compared with 232 of 590 patients (39%) in the conventional tidal volume group (difference, -1.3% [95% CI, -6.8% to 4.2%]; risk ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.84-1.11]; P = .64). There were no significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among adult patients undergoing major surgery, intraoperative ventilation with low tidal volume compared with conventional tidal volume, with PEEP applied equally between groups, did not significantly reduce pulmonary complications within the first 7 postoperative days.

      To investigate whether large volume acute normovolemic hemodilution (L-ANH), compared with moderate acute normovolemic hemodilution (M-ANH), can reduce perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion in patients with intermediate-high risk of transfusion during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
    


          Design:
        
      
      Prospective randomized controlled trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      University hospital.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Patients with transfusion risk understanding scoring tool (""TRUST"") ≥2 points undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from May 2020 to January 2021 were included.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      The patients were randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to M-ANH (5 to 8 mL/kg) or L-ANH (12 to 15 mL/kg).
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      The primary outcome was perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion units. The composite outcome included new-onset atrial fibrillation, pulmonary infection, cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) class ≥2, surgical incision infection, postoperative excessive bleeding, and resternotomy.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      Total 159 patients were screened and 110 (55 L-ANH and 55 M-ANH) were included for final analysis. Removed blood volume of L-ANH is significantly higher than M-ANH (886 ± 152 vs. 395 ± 86 mL, P < 0.001). Perioperative RBC transfusion was median 0 unit ([25th, 75th] percentiles: 0-4.4) in M-ANH group vs. 0 unit ([25th, 75th] percentiles: 0-2.0) in L-ANH group (P = 0.012) and L-ANH was associated with lower incidence of transfusion (23.6% vs. 41.8%, P = 0.042, rate difference: 0.182, 95% confidence interval [0.007-0.343]). The incidence of postoperative excessive bleeding was significantly lower in L-ANH vs. M-ANH (3.6% vs. 18.2%, P = 0.029, rate difference: 0.146, 95% confidence interval [0.027-0.270]) without significant difference for other second outcomes. The volume of ANH was inversely related to perioperative RBC transfusion units (Spearman r = -0.483, 95% confidence interval [-0.708 to -0.168], P = 0.003), and L-ANH in cardiac surgery was associated with a significantly reduced risk of perioperative RBC transfusion (odds ratio: 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.98, P = 0.044).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Compared with M-ANH, L-ANH during cardiac surgery inclined to be associated with reduced perioperative RBC transfusion and the volume of RBC transfusion was inversely proportional to the volume of ANH. In addition, LANH during cardiac surgery was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative excessive bleeding."
Myocardial Injury After Balloon Predilatation Versus Direct Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Insights From the DIRECTAVI Trial.,"Mariama Akodad, François Roubille, Gregory Marin, Benoit Lattuca, Jean-Christophe Macia, Delphine Delseny, Thomas Gandet, Pierre Robert, Laurent Schmutz, Christophe Piot, Eric Maupas, Gabriel Robert, Frederic Targosz, Bernard Albat, Guillaume Cayla, Florence Leclercq, Mariama Akodadet al.",2020 Dec 15,J Am Heart Assoc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33297821/,"balloon aortic valvuloplasty, direct implantation, myocardial injury, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, troponin.","Background Myocardial injury is associated with higher mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and might be increased by prior balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). We aimed to evaluate the impact of prior BAV versus direct prosthesis implantation on myocardial injury occurring after (TAVR) with balloon-expandable prostheses. Methods and Results The DIRECTAVI (Direct Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial, an open-label randomized study, demonstrated noninferiority of TAVR without BAV (direct TAVR group) compared with systematic BAV (BAV group) with the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve. High-sensitivity troponin was assessed before and the day after the procedure. Incidence of myocardial injury after the procedure (high-sensitivity troponin elevation >15× the upper reference limit [14 ng/L]) was the main end point. Impact of myocardial injury on 1-month adverse events (all-cause mortality, stroke, major bleeding, major vascular complications, transfusion, acute kidney injury, heart failure, pacemaker implantation, and aortic regurgitation) was evaluated. Preprocedure and postprocedure high-sensitivity troponin levels were available in 211 patients. The mean age of patients was 83 years (78-87 years), with 129 men (61.1%). Mean postprocedure high-sensitivity troponin was 124.9±81.4 ng/L in the direct TAVR group versus 170.4±127.7 ng/L in the BAV group (P=0.007). Myocardial injury occurred in 42 patients (19.9%), including 13 patients (12.2%) in the direct TAVR group and 29 (27.9%) in the BAV group (P=0.004). BAV increased by 2.8-fold (95% CI, 1.4-5.8) myocardial injury probability. Myocardial injury was associated with 1-month adverse events (P=0.03). Conclusions BAV increased the incidence and magnitude of myocardial injury after TAVR with new-generation balloon-expandable valves. Myocardial injury was associated with 1-month adverse events. These results argue in favor of direct SAPIEN 3 valve implantation. Registration URL: https://www.Clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02729519."
Ankle-brachial pressure index as a predictor of the 2-year outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: data from the Japanese OCEAN-TAVI Registry.,"Masahiro Yamawaki, Motoharu Araki, Tsutomu Ito, Yosuke Honda, Takahiro Tokuda, Yoshiaki Ito, Hiroshi Ueno, Kazuki Mizutani, Minoru Tabata, Akihiro Higashimori, Norio Tada, Kensuke Takagi, Futoshi Yamanaka, Toru Naganuma, Yusuke Watanabe, Masanori Yamamoto, Shinichi Shirai, Kentaro Hayashida                              ;, OCEAN-TAVI Registry, Masahiro Yamawakiet al.",2018 Jun,Heart Vessels,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29230568/,"Ankle–brachial index, Long-term outcome, Peripheral artery disease, Transcatheter aortic valve replacement.","Peripheral artery disease plays a pivotal role for access site selection in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a generalized mortality marker in many cardiovascular scenarios. However, the long-term outcomes in high-risk TAVR populations remain unclear. We investigated the association between low ABI and 2-year outcome after TAVR. Of 1613 patients enrolled in the OCEAN-TAVI registry, 1458 (90.4%) who underwent ABI before TAVR were divided into groups: patients with (1) ABI ≥ 0.9 in both legs and (2) ABI < 0.9 in either leg. Primary endpoint was all-cause death within 2 years. ABI < 0.9 was noted in 304 patients (20.8%). ABI < 0.9-group had more frequent and severe comorbidities. Primary endpoint in ABI < 0.9-group was significantly higher than that in ABI ≥ 0.9-group (15.8 vs. 8.7%, p < 0.001). This trend continued in the transfemoral (TF)-approach (14.9 vs. 7.5%, p < 0.001), but not in the alternative approach (17.2 vs. 15.8%, p = 0.815). Within 30 days, ABI < 0.9-group had a higher cardiac death rate (3.1 vs. 1.0%, p = 0.033), whereas between 31 days and 2 years, non-cardiovascular death was more frequently observed (9.2 vs. 5.1%, p = 0.003). In ABI < 0.9-group, in-hospital vascular complications (11.9 vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (10.8 vs, 5.7%, p = 0.009) were more frequently found when using the transfemoral-approach. In multivariate analysis, ABI < 0.9 was an independent predictor of 2-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.495, 95% CI 1.007-2.220, p = 0.046). Pre-procedure ABI < 0.9 is a useful prognostic marker for all-cause mortality, even in high-risk TAVR populations."
Final 3-Year Outcomes of a Randomized Trial Comparing a Self-Expanding to a Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valve.,"Jonas Lanz, Helge Möllmann, Won-Keun Kim, Christof Burgdorf, Axel Linke, Simon Redwood, Michael Hilker, Michael Joner, Holger Thiele, Lars Conzelmann, Lenard Conradi, Sebastian Kerber, Christian Thilo, Stefan Toggweiler, Bernard Prendergast, Oliver Husser, Stefan Stortecky, Sarah Deckarm, Arnaud Künzi, Dik Heg, Thomas Walther, Stephan Windecker, Thomas Pilgrim                              ;, SCOPE I Investigators, Jonas Lanzet al.",2023 Jul,Circ Cardiovasc Interv,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37417229/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      In the SCOPE I trial (Safety and Efficacy of the Symetis ACURATE Neo/TF Compared to the Edwards SAPIEN 3 Bioprosthesis), transcatheter aortic valve implantation with the self-expanding ACURATE neo (NEO) did not meet noninferiority compared with the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 (S3) device regarding a composite end point at 30 days due to higher rates of prosthetic valve regurgitation and acute kidney injury. Data on long-term durability of NEO are scarce. Here, we report whether early differences between NEO and S3 translate into differences in clinical outcomes or bioprosthetic valve failure 3 years after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with severe aortic stenosis were randomized to transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation with NEO or S3 at 20 European centers. Clinical outcomes at 3 years are compared using Cox proportional or Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models by intention-to-treat. Bioprosthetic valve failure is reported for the valve-implant cohort.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 739 patients, 84 of 372 patients (24.3%) had died in the NEO and 85 of 367 (25%) in the S3 group at 3 years. Comparing NEO with S3, the 3-year rates of all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.73-1.33]), stroke (subhazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.56-1.92]), and hospitalization for congestive heart failure (subhazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.51-1.07]) were similar between the groups. Aortic valve reinterventions were required in 4 NEO and 3 S3 patients (subhazard ratio, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.30-5.85]). New York Heart Association functional class ≤II was observed in 84% (NEO) and 85% (S3), respectively. Mean gradients remained lower after NEO at 3 years (8 versus 12 mm Hg; P<0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Early differences between NEO and S3 did not translate into significant differences in clinical outcomes or bioprosthetic valve failure throughout 3 years.

      Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The role of immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the treatment of patients who have been successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest in the absence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains uncertain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 552 patients who had cardiac arrest without signs of STEMI to undergo immediate coronary angiography or coronary angiography that was delayed until after neurologic recovery. All patients underwent PCI if indicated. The primary end point was survival at 90 days. Secondary end points included survival at 90 days with good cerebral performance or mild or moderate disability, myocardial injury, duration of catecholamine support, markers of shock, recurrence of ventricular tachycardia, duration of mechanical ventilation, major bleeding, occurrence of acute kidney injury, need for renal-replacement therapy, time to target temperature, and neurologic status at discharge from the intensive care unit.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At 90 days, 176 of 273 patients (64.5%) in the immediate angiography group and 178 of 265 patients (67.2%) in the delayed angiography group were alive (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 1.27; P = 0.51). The median time to target temperature was 5.4 hours in the immediate angiography group and 4.7 hours in the delayed angiography group (ratio of geometric means, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.36). No significant differences between the groups were found in the remaining secondary end points.

If noninferiority criteria were met, the secondary end point of 1-year moderate or greater paravalvular leak was tested for superiority in the full analysis data set.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 912 randomized patients (mean age, 82.8 [SD, 7.3] years; 463 [51%] women; predicted risk of mortality, 6.8%), 874 (96%) were evaluable at 1 year. The primary safety composite end point at 30 days occurred in 20.3% of MEV patients and 17.2% of SEV patients (difference, 3.1%; Farrington-Manning 97.5% CI, -∞ to 8.3%; P = .003 for noninferiority). At 1 year, the primary effectiveness composite end point occurred in 15.4% with the MEV and 25.5% with the SEV (difference, -10.1%; Farrington-Manning 97.5% CI, -∞ to -4.4%; P<.001 for noninferiority). The 1-year rates of moderate or severe paravalvular leak were 0.9% for the MEV and 6.8% for the SEV (difference, -6.1%; 95% CI, -9.6% to -2.6%; P < .001). The superiority analysis for primary effectiveness was statistically significant (difference, -10.2%; 95% CI, -16.3% to -4.0%; P < .001). The MEV had higher rates of new pacemaker implants (35.5% vs 19.6%; P < .001) and valve thrombosis (1.5% vs 0%) but lower rates of repeat procedures (0.2% vs 2.0%), valve-in-valve deployments (0% vs 3.7%), and valve malpositioning (0% vs 2.7%).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among high-risk patients with aortic stenosis, use of the MEV compared with the SEV did not result in inferior outcomes for the primary safety end point or the primary effectiveness end point. These findings suggest that the MEV may be a useful addition for TAVR in high-risk patients.

Earlier time to hemostasis is associated with decreased mortality and rate of complications: Results from the Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratio trial.,"Ronald Chang, Jeffrey D Kerby, Kyle J Kalkwarf, Gerald Van Belle, Erin E Fox, Bryan A Cotton, Mitchell J Cohen, Martin A Schreiber, Karen Brasel, Eileen M Bulger, Kenji Inaba, Sandro Rizoli, Jeanette M Podbielski, Charles E Wade, John B Holcomb;, PROPPR Study Group, Ronald Changet al.",2019 Aug,J Trauma Acute Care Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31349348/,No keywords found,"Backdrop:
        
      
      Clinicians intuitively recognize that faster time to hemostasis is important in bleeding trauma patients, but these times are rarely reported.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Prospectively collected data from the Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios trial were analyzed. Hemostasis was predefined as no intraoperative bleeding requiring intervention in the surgical field or resolution of contrast blush on interventional radiology (IR). Patients who underwent an emergent (within 90 minutes) operating room (OR) or IR procedure were included. Mixed-effects Poisson regression with robust error variance (controlling for age, Injury Severity Score, treatment arm, injury mechanism, base excess on admission [missing values estimated by multiple imputation], and time to OR/IR as fixed effects and study site as a random effect) with modified Bonferroni corrections tested the hypothesis that decreased time to hemostasis was associated with decreased mortality and decreased incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple-organ failure (MOF), sepsis, and venous thromboembolism.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 680 enrolled patients, 468 (69%) underwent an emergent procedure. Patients with decreased time to hemostasis were less severely injured, had less deranged base excess on admission, and lower incidence of blunt trauma (all p < 0.05). In 408 (87%) patients in whom hemostasis was achieved, every 15-minute decrease in time to hemostasis was associated with decreased 30-day mortality (RR, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-0.99), AKI (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.98), ARDS (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99), MOF (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.97), and sepsis (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99), but not venous thromboembolism (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1.03).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Earlier time to hemostasis was independently associated with decreased incidence of 30-day mortality, AKI, ARDS, MOF, and sepsis in bleeding trauma patients. Time to hemostasis should be considered as an endpoint in trauma studies and as a potential quality indicator.

      This study sought to determine if percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with significant coronary artery disease would produce noninferior clinical results when compared with no PCI (control arm).
    


          Background:
        
      
      PCI in patients undergoing TAVR is not without risk, and there are no randomized data to inform clinical practice.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and significant coronary artery disease with Canadian Cardiovascular Society class ≤2 angina were randomly assigned to receive PCI or no PCI prior to TAVR. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death or rehospitalization at 1 year. Noninferiority testing (prespecified margin of 7.5%) was performed in the intention-to-treat population.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At 17 centers, 235 patients underwent randomization. At 1 year, the primary composite endpoint occurred in 48 (41.5%) of the PCI arm and 47 (44.0%) of the no-PCI arm. The requirement for noninferiority was not met (difference: -2.5%; 1-sided upper 95% confidence limit: 8.5%; 1-sided noninferiority test P = 0.067). On analysis of the as-treated population, the difference was -3.7% (1-sided upper 95% confidence limit: 7.5%; P = 0.050). Mortality was 16 (13.4%) in the PCI arm and 14 (12.1%) in the no-PCI arm. At 1 year, there was no evidence of a difference in the rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, or acute kidney injury, with higher rates of any bleed in the PCI arm (P = 0.021).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Observed rates of death and rehospitalization at 1 year were similar between PCI and no PCI prior to TAVR; however, the noninferiority margin was not met, and PCI resulted in a higher incidence of bleeding.

Association of Elevated Plasma Interleukin-18 Level With Increased Mortality in a Clinical Trial of Statin Treatment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.,"Angela J Rogers, Jiazhen Guan, Anna Trtchounian, Gary M Hunninghake, Rajani Kaimal, Manisha Desai, Lori-Ann Kozikowski, Lesley DeSouza, Susan Mogan, Kathleen D Liu, Michael A Matthay, Jay Steingrub, Art Wheeler, Joo Heon Yoon, Kiichi Nakahira, Augustine M Choi, Rebecca M Baron, Angela J Rogerset al.",2019 Aug,Crit Care Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31206358/,No keywords found,"Objective:
        
      
      A high plasma level of inflammasome mediator interleukin-18 was associated with mortality in observational acute respiratory distress syndrome cohorts. Statin exposure increases both inflammasome activation and lung injury in mouse models. We tested whether randomization to statin therapy correlated with increased interleukin-18 in the ARDS Network Statins for Acutely Injured Lungs from Sepsis trial.

          Patients:
        
      
      Six hundred eighty-three subjects with infection-related acute respiratory distress syndrome, representing 92% of the original trial population.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Random assignment of rosuvastatin or placebo for up to 28 days or 3 days after ICU discharge.
    


          Measurements and main results:
        
      
      We measured plasma interleukin-18 levels in all Statins for Acutely Injured Lungs from Sepsis patients with sample available at day 0 (baseline, n = 683) and day 3 (after randomization, n = 588). We tested the association among interleukin-18 level at baseline, rising interleukin-18, and the impact of statin therapy on 60-day mortality, adjusting for severity of illness. Baseline plasma interleukin-18 level greater than or equal to 800 pg/mL was highly associated with 60-day mortality, with a hazard of death of 2.3 (95% CI, 1.7-3.1). Rising plasma interleukin-18 was also associated with increased mortality. For each unit increase in log2 (interleukin-18) at day 3 compared with baseline, the hazard of death increased by 2.3 (95% CI, 1.5-3.5). Subjects randomized to statin were significantly more likely to experience a rise in plasma interleukin-18 levels. Subjects with acute kidney injury, shock, low baseline interleukin-18, and those not receiving systemic corticosteroids were more likely to experience rising interleukin-18. Randomization to statin therapy was associated with rising in interleukin-18 in all of those subsets, however.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Elevated baseline plasma interleukin-18 was associated with higher mortality in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. A rise in plasma interleukin-18 was also associated with increased mortality and was more common in subjects randomized to statin therapy in this clinical trial."

      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is an established, guideline-endorsed treatment for severe aortic stenosis. Precise sizing of the balloon-expandable Myval transcatheter heart valve (THV) series with the aortic annulus is facilitated by increasing its diameter in 1·5 mm increments, compared with the usual 3 mm increments in valve size. The LANDMARK trial aimed to show non-inferiority of the Myval THV series compared with the contemporary THVs Sapien Series (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) or Evolut Series (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective, multinational, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial across 31 hospitals in 16 countries (Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, New Zealand, Portugal, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Estonia, and Brazil), 768 participants with severe symptomatic native aortic stenosis were randomly assigned (1:1) to the Myval THV or a contemporary THV. Eligibility was primarily decided by the heart team in accordance with 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines. As per the criteria of the third Valve Academic Research Consortium, the primary endpoint at 30 days was a composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, bleeding (types 3 and 4), acute kidney injury (stages 2-4), major vascular complications, moderate or severe prosthetic valve regurgitation, and conduction system disturbances resulting in a permanent pacemaker implantation. Non-inferiority of the study device was tested in the intention-to-treat population using a non-inferiority margin of 10·44% and assuming an event rate of 26·10%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04275726, and EudraCT, 2020-000137-40, and is closed to new participants.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Jan 6, 2021, and Dec 5, 2023, 768 participants with severe symptomatic native aortic stenosis were randomly assigned, 384 to the Myval THV and 384 to a contemporary THV. 369 (48%) participants had their sex recorded as female, and 399 (52%) as male. The mean age of participants was 80·0 years (SD 5·7) for those treated with the Myval THV and 80·4 years (5·4) for those treated with a contemporary THV. Median Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores were the same in both groups (Myval 2·6% [IQR 1·7-4·0] vs contemporary 2·6% [1·7-4·0]). The primary endpoint showed non-inferiority of the Myval (25%) compared with contemporary THV (27%), with a risk difference of -2·3% (one-sided upper 95% CI 3·8, pnon-inferiority<0·0001). No significant difference was seen in individual components of the primary composite endpoint.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      In individuals with severe symptomatic native aortic stenosis, the Myval THV met its primary endpoint at 30 days.

      Despite the availability of effective therapies for patients with chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension (the kidney-dysfunction triad), the results of large-scale trials examining the implementation of guideline-directed therapy to reduce the risk of death and complications in this population are lacking.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this open-label, cluster-randomized trial, we assigned 11,182 patients with the kidney-dysfunction triad who were being treated at 141 primary care clinics either to receive an intervention that used a personalized algorithm (based on the patient's electronic health record [EHR]) to identify patients and practice facilitators to assist providers in delivering guideline-based interventions or to receive usual care. The primary outcome was hospitalization for any cause at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included emergency department visits, readmissions, cardiovascular events, dialysis, and death.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We assigned 71 practices (enrolling 5690 patients) to the intervention group and 70 practices (enrolling 5492 patients) to the usual-care group. The hospitalization rate at 1 year was 20.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.7 to 21.8) in the intervention group and 21.1% (95% CI, 20.1 to 22.2) in the usual-care group (between-group difference, 0.4 percentage points; P = 0.58). The risks of emergency department visits, readmissions, cardiovascular events, dialysis, or death from any cause were similar in the two groups. The risk of adverse events was also similar in the trial groups, except for acute kidney injury, which was observed in more patients in the intervention group (12.7% vs. 11.3%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this pragmatic trial involving patients with the triad of chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, the use of an EHR-based algorithm and practice facilitators embedded in primary care clinics did not translate into reduced hospitalization at 1 year.

Effect of Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering on Kidney Tubule Injury: Findings From the ACCORD Trial Study Participants.,"Girish N Nadkarni, Kinsuk Chauhan, Veena Rao, Joachim H Ix, Michael G Shlipak, Chirag R Parikh, Steven G Coca, Girish N Nadkarniet al.",2019 Jan,Am J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291011/,No keywords found,"Rationale & objective:
        
      
      Random assignment to intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering (systolic BP<120mmHg) compared to a less intensive BP target (systolic BP<140mmHg) in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes BP (ACCORD-BP) trial resulted in a more rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Whether this reflects hemodynamic effects or intrinsic kidney damage is unknown.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Longitudinal analysis of a subgroup of clinical trial participants.
    


          Settings & participants:
        
      
      A subgroup of 529 participants in ACCORD-BP.
    


          Exposures:
        
      
      Urine biomarkers of tubular injury (kidney injury molecule 1, interleukin 18 [IL-18]), repair (human cartilage glycoprotein 39 [YKL-40]), and inflammation (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) at baseline and year 2.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      Changes in eGFR from baseline to 2 years.
    


          Analytical approach:
        
      
      We compared changes in biomarker levels and eGFRs across participants treated to an intensive versus less intensive BP goal using analysis of covariance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 529 participants, 260 had been randomly assigned to the intensive and 269 to the standard BP arm. Mean age was 62±6.5 years and eGFR was 90mL/min/1.73m2. Baseline clinical characteristics, eGFRs, urinary albumin-creatinine ratios (ACRs), and urinary biomarker levels were similar across BP treatment groups. Compared to less intensive BP treatment, eGFR was 9.2mL/min/1.73m2 lower in the intensive BP treatment group at year 2. Despite the eGFR reduction, within this treatment group, ACR was 30% lower and 4 urinary biomarker levels were unchanged or lower at year 2. Also within this group, participants with the largest declines in eGFRs had greater reductions in urinary IL-18 and YKL-40 levels. In a subgroup analysis of participants developing incident chronic kidney disease (sustained 30% decline and eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2; n=77), neither ACR nor 4 biomarker levels increased in the intensive treatment group, whereas the level of 1 biomarker, IL-18, increased in the less intensive treatment group.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Few participants with advanced baseline chronic kidney disease. Comparisons across treatment groups do not represent comparisons of treatment arms created solely through randomization.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among a subset of ACCORD-BP trial participants, intensive BP control was associated with reductions in eGFRs, but not with an increase in injury marker levels. These findings support that eGFR decline observed with intensive BP goals in ACCORD participants may predominantly reflect hemodynamic alterations."
Associations of Biomarkers of Tubular Injury and Inflammation with Biopsy Features in Type 1 Diabetes.,"Christine P Limonte, David K Prince, Andrew N Hoofnagle, Andrzej Galecki, Irl B Hirsch, Frances Tian, Sushrut S Waikar, Helen C Looker, Robert G Nelson, Alessandro Doria, Michael Mauer, Bryan R Kestenbaum, Ian H de Boer, Christine P Limonteet al.",2024 Jan 1,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37871959/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Whether biomarkers of tubular injury and inflammation indicate subclinical structural kidney pathology early in type 1 diabetes remains unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We investigated associations of biomarkers of tubular injury and inflammation with kidney structural features in 244 adults with type 1 diabetes from the Renin-Angiotensin System Study, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing effects of enalapril or losartan on changes in glomerular, tubulointerstitial, and vascular parameters from baseline to 5-year kidney biopsies. Biosamples at biopsy were assessed for kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1), arginine-to-citrulline ratio in plasma, and uromodulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in urine. We examined cross-sectional correlations between biomarkers and biopsy features and baseline biomarker associations with 5-year changes in biopsy features.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants' mean age was 30 years (SD 10) and diabetes duration 11 years (SD 5); 53% were women. The mean GFR measured by iohexol disappearance was 128 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 19) and median urinary albumin excretion was 5 μ g/min (interquartile range, 3-8). KIM-1 was associated with most biopsy features: higher mesangial fractional volume (0.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.1 to 0.9] greater per SD KIM-1), glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width (14.2 nm [95% CI, 6.5 to 22.0] thicker), cortical interstitial fractional volume (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.6] greater), fractional volume of cortical atrophic tubules (0.6% [95% CI, 0.2 to 0.9] greater), and arteriolar hyalinosis index (0.03 [95% CI, 0.1 to 0.05] higher). sTNFR1 was associated with higher mesangial fractional volume (0.9% [95% CI, 0.5 to 1.3] greater) and GBM width (12.5 nm [95% CI, 4.5 to 20.5] thicker) and lower GBM surface density (0.003 μ m 2 / μ m 3 [95% CI, 0.005 to 0.001] lesser). EGF and arginine-to-citrulline ratio correlated with severity of glomerular and tubulointerstitial features. Baseline sTNFR1, uromodulin, and EGF concentrations were associated with 5-year glomerular and tubulointerstitial feature progression.

Remote Ischemic Preconditioning and Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery.,"Derek J Hausenloy, Luciano Candilio, Richard Evans, Cono Ariti, David P Jenkins, Shyam Kolvekar, Rosemary Knight, Gudrun Kunst, Christopher Laing, Jennifer Nicholas, John Pepper, Steven Robertson, Maria Xenou, Tim Clayton, Derek M Yellon;, ERICCA Trial Investigators, Derek J Hausenloyet al.",2015 Oct 8,N Engl J Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26436207/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Whether remote ischemic preconditioning (transient ischemia and reperfusion of the arm) can improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is not known. We investigated this question in a randomized trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a multicenter, sham-controlled trial involving adults at increased surgical risk who were undergoing on-pump CABG (with or without valve surgery) with blood cardioplegia. After anesthesia induction and before surgical incision, patients were randomly assigned to remote ischemic preconditioning (four 5-minute inflations and deflations of a standard blood-pressure cuff on the upper arm) or sham conditioning (control group). Anesthetic management and perioperative care were not standardized. The combined primary end point was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or stroke, assessed 12 months after randomization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We enrolled a total of 1612 patients (811 in the control group and 801 in the ischemic-preconditioning group) at 30 cardiac surgery centers in the United Kingdom. There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of the primary end point at 12 months between the patients in the remote ischemic preconditioning group and those in the control group (212 patients [26.5%] and 225 patients [27.7%], respectively; hazard ratio with ischemic preconditioning, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.15; P=0.58). Furthermore, there were no significant between-group differences in either adverse events or the secondary end points of perioperative myocardial injury (assessed on the basis of the area under the curve for the high-sensitivity assay of serum troponin T at 72 hours), inotrope score (calculated from the maximum dose of the individual inotropic agents administered in the first 3 days after surgery), acute kidney injury, duration of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, distance on the 6-minute walk test, and quality of life.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Remote ischemic preconditioning did not improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing elective on-pump CABG with or without valve surgery.

      Patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease have been found to have better outcomes with coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) than with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but studies in which PCI is guided by measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) have been lacking.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this multicenter, international, noninferiority trial, patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to undergo CABG or FFR-guided PCI with current-generation zotarolimus-eluting stents. The primary end point was the occurrence within 1 year of a major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event, defined as death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization. Noninferiority of FFR-guided PCI to CABG was prespecified as an upper boundary of less than 1.65 for the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio. Secondary end points included a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke; safety was also assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1500 patients underwent randomization at 48 centers. Patients assigned to undergo PCI received a mean (±SD) of 3.7±1.9 stents, and those assigned to undergo CABG received 3.4±1.0 distal anastomoses. The 1-year incidence of the composite primary end point was 10.6% among patients randomly assigned to undergo FFR-guided PCI and 6.9% among those assigned to undergo CABG (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 2.2), findings that were not consistent with noninferiority of FFR-guided PCI (P = 0.35 for noninferiority). The incidence of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke was 7.3% in the FFR-guided PCI group and 5.2% in the CABG group (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9 to 2.1). The incidences of major bleeding, arrhythmia, and acute kidney injury were higher in the CABG group than in the FFR-guided PCI group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease, FFR-guided PCI was not found to be noninferior to CABG with respect to the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization at 1 year.

      Radical surgery via total mesorectal excision might not be the optimal first-line treatment for early-stage rectal cancer. An organ-preserving strategy with selective total mesorectal excision could reduce the adverse effects of treatment without substantially compromising oncological outcomes. We investigated the feasibility of recruiting patients to a randomised trial comparing an organ-preserving strategy with total mesorectal excision.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      TREC was a randomised, open-label feasibility study done at 21 tertiary referral centres in the UK. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with rectal adenocarcinoma, staged T2 or lower, with a maximum diameter of 30 mm or less; patients with lymph node involvement or metastases were excluded. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) by use of a computer-based randomisation service to undergo organ preservation with short-course radiotherapy followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery after 8-10 weeks, or total mesorectal excision. Where the transanal endoscopic microsurgery specimen showed histopathological features associated with an increased risk of local recurrence, patients were considered for planned early conversion to total mesorectal excision. A non-randomised prospective registry captured patients for whom randomisation was considered inappropriate, because of a strong clinical indication for one treatment group. The primary endpoint was cumulative randomisation at 12, 18, and 24 months. Secondary outcomes evaluated safety, efficacy, and health-related quality of life assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30 and CR29 in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN14422743.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Feb 22, 2012, and Dec 19, 2014, 55 patients were randomly assigned at 15 sites; 27 to organ preservation and 28 to radical surgery. Cumulatively, 18 patients had been randomly assigned at 12 months, 31 at 18 months, and 39 at 24 months. No patients died within 30 days of initial treatment, but one patient randomly assigned to organ preservation died within 6 months following conversion to total mesorectal excision with anastomotic leakage. Eight (30%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation were converted to total mesorectal excision. Serious adverse events were reported in four (15%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation versus 11 (39%) of 28 randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision (p=0·04, χ2 test). Serious adverse events associated with organ preservation were most commonly due to rectal bleeding or pain following transanal endoscopic microsurgery (reported in three cases). Radical total mesorectal excision was associated with medical and surgical complications including anastomotic leakage (two patients), kidney injury (two patients), cardiac arrest (one patient), and pneumonia (two patients). Histopathological features that would be considered to be associated with increased risk of tumour recurrence if observed after transanal endoscopic microsurgery alone were present in 16 (59%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation, versus 24 (86%) of 28 randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision (p=0·03, χ2 test). Eight (30%) of 27 patients assigned to organ preservation achieved a complete response to radiotherapy. Patients who were randomly assigned to organ preservation showed improvements in patient-reported bowel toxicities and quality of life and function scores in multiple items compared to those who were randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision, which were sustained over 36 months' follow-up. The non-randomised registry comprised 61 patients who underwent organ preservation and seven who underwent radical surgery. Non-randomised patients who underwent organ preservation were older than randomised patients and more likely to have life-limiting comorbidities. Serious adverse events occurred in ten (16%) of 61 non-randomised patients who underwent organ preservation versus one (14%) of seven who underwent total mesorectal excision. 24 (39%) of 61 non-randomised patients who underwent organ preservation had high-risk histopathological features, while 25 (41%) of 61 achieved a complete response. Overall, organ preservation was achieved in 19 (70%) of 27 randomised patients and 56 (92%) of 61 non-randomised patients.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Short-course radiotherapy followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery achieves high levels of organ preservation, with relatively low morbidity and indications of improved quality of life. These data support the use of organ preservation for patients considered unsuitable for primary total mesorectal excision due to the short-term risks associated with this surgery, and support further evaluation of short-course radiotherapy to achieve organ preservation in patients considered fit for total mesorectal excision. Larger randomised studies, such as the ongoing STAR-TREC study, are needed to more precisely determine oncological outcomes following different organ preservation treatment schedules.

      Randomized, controlled trials have shown both benefit and harm from tight blood-glucose control in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Variation in the use of early parenteral nutrition and in insulin-induced severe hypoglycemia might explain this inconsistency.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We randomly assigned patients, on ICU admission, to liberal glucose control (insulin initiated only when the blood-glucose level was >215 mg per deciliter [>11.9 mmol per liter]) or to tight glucose control (blood-glucose level targeted with the use of the LOGIC-Insulin algorithm at 80 to 110 mg per deciliter [4.4 to 6.1 mmol per liter]); parenteral nutrition was withheld in both groups for 1 week. Protocol adherence was determined according to glucose metrics. The primary outcome was the length of time that ICU care was needed, calculated on the basis of time to discharge alive from the ICU, with death accounted for as a competing risk; 90-day mortality was the safety outcome.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 9230 patients who underwent randomization, 4622 were assigned to liberal glucose control and 4608 to tight glucose control. The median morning blood-glucose level was 140 mg per deciliter (interquartile range, 122 to 161) with liberal glucose control and 107 mg per deciliter (interquartile range, 98 to 117) with tight glucose control. Severe hypoglycemia occurred in 31 patients (0.7%) in the liberal-control group and 47 patients (1.0%) in the tight-control group. The length of time that ICU care was needed was similar in the two groups (hazard ratio for earlier discharge alive with tight glucose control, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.04; P = 0.94). Mortality at 90 days was also similar (10.1% with liberal glucose control and 10.5% with tight glucose control, P = 0.51). Analyses of eight prespecified secondary outcomes suggested that the incidence of new infections, the duration of respiratory and hemodynamic support, the time to discharge alive from the hospital, and mortality in the ICU and hospital were similar in the two groups, whereas severe acute kidney injury and cholestatic liver dysfunction appeared less prevalent with tight glucose control.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In critically ill patients who were not receiving early parenteral nutrition, tight glucose control did not affect the length of time that ICU care was needed or mortality. (Funded by the Research Foundation-Flanders and others; TGC-Fast ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03665207.)."
Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic-Valve Replacement in Intermediate-Risk Patients.,"Martin B Leon, Craig R Smith, Michael J Mack, Raj R Makkar, Lars G Svensson, Susheel K Kodali, Vinod H Thourani, E Murat Tuzcu, D Craig Miller, Howard C Herrmann, Darshan Doshi, David J Cohen, Augusto D Pichard, Samir Kapadia, Todd Dewey, Vasilis Babaliaros, Wilson Y Szeto, Mathew R Williams, Dean Kereiakes, Alan Zajarias, Kevin L Greason, Brian K Whisenant, Robert W Hodson, Jeffrey W Moses, Alfredo Trento, David L Brown, William F Fearon, Philippe Pibarot, Rebecca T Hahn, Wael A Jaber, William N Anderson, Maria C Alu, John G Webb                              ;, PARTNER  Investigators, Martin B Leonet al.",2016 Apr 28,N Engl J Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27040324/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Previous trials have shown that among high-risk patients with aortic stenosis, survival rates are similar with transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic-valve replacement. We evaluated the two procedures in a randomized trial involving intermediate-risk patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We randomly assigned 2032 intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, at 57 centers, to undergo either TAVR or surgical replacement. The primary end point was death from any cause or disabling stroke at 2 years. The primary hypothesis was that TAVR would not be inferior to surgical replacement. Before randomization, patients were entered into one of two cohorts on the basis of clinical and imaging findings; 76.3% of the patients were included in the transfemoral-access cohort and 23.7% in the transthoracic-access cohort.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The rate of death from any cause or disabling stroke was similar in the TAVR group and the surgery group (P=0.001 for noninferiority). At 2 years, the Kaplan-Meier event rates were 19.3% in the TAVR group and 21.1% in the surgery group (hazard ratio in the TAVR group, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 1.09; P=0.25). In the transfemoral-access cohort, TAVR resulted in a lower rate of death or disabling stroke than surgery (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.00; P=0.05), whereas in the transthoracic-access cohort, outcomes were similar in the two groups. TAVR resulted in larger aortic-valve areas than did surgery and also resulted in lower rates of acute kidney injury, severe bleeding, and new-onset atrial fibrillation; surgery resulted in fewer major vascular complications and less paravalvular aortic regurgitation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In intermediate-risk patients, TAVR was similar to surgical aortic-valve replacement with respect to the primary end point of death or disabling stroke. (Funded by Edwards Lifesciences; PARTNER 2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01314313.)."
Novel Risk Factors for Progression of Diabetic and Nondiabetic CKD: Findings From the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study.,"Amanda H Anderson, Dawei Xie, Xue Wang, Robin L Baudier, Paula Orlandi, Lawrence J Appel, Laura M Dember, Jiang He, John W Kusek, James P Lash, Sankar D Navaneethan, Akinlolu Ojo, Mahboob Rahman, Jason Roy, Julia J Scialla, James H Sondheimer, Susan P Steigerwalt, F Perry Wilson, Myles Wolf, Harold I Feldman                              ;, CRIC Study Investigators, Alan S Go, Raymond R Townsend, Amanda H Andersonet al.",2021 Jan,Am J Kidney Dis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32866540/,No keywords found,"Rationale & objective:
        
      
      Identification of novel risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression may inform mechanistic investigations and improve identification of high-risk subgroups. The current study aimed to characterize CKD progression across levels of numerous risk factors and identify independent risk factors for CKD progression among those with and without diabetes.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study is a prospective cohort study of adults with CKD conducted at 7 US clinical centers.
    


          Setting & participants:
        
      
      Participants (N=3,379) had up to 12.3 years of follow-up; 47% had diabetes.
    


          Predictors:
        
      
      30 risk factors for CKD progression across sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, and biochemical domains at baseline.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      Study outcomes were estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope and the composite of halving of eGFR or initiation of kidney replacement therapy.
    


          Analytical approach:
        
      
      Stepwise selection of independent risk factors was performed stratified by diabetes status using linear mixed-effects and Cox proportional hazards models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among those without and with diabetes, respectively, mean eGFR slope was-1.4±3.3 and-2.7±4.7mL/min/1.73m2 per year. Among participants with diabetes, multivariable-adjusted hazard of the composite outcome was approximately 2-fold or greater with higher levels of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL12, the cardiac marker N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and the kidney injury marker urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Among those without diabetes, low serum bicarbonate and higher high-sensitivity troponin T, NT-proBNP, and urinary NGAL levels were all significantly associated with a 1.5-fold or greater rate of the composite outcome.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      The observational study design precludes causal inference.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Strong associations for cardiac markers, plasma CXCL12, and urinary NGAL are comparable to that of systolic blood pressure≥140mm Hg, a well-established risk factor for CKD progression. This warrants further investigation into the potential mechanisms that these markers indicate and opportunities to use them to improve risk stratification."

      Vilobelimab, an anti-C5a monoclonal antibody, was shown to be safe in a phase 2 trial of invasively mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. Here, we aimed to determine whether vilobelimab in addition to standard of care improves survival outcomes in this patient population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 trial was performed at 46 hospitals in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, Russia, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, and South Africa. Participants aged 18 years or older who were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, but not more than 48 h after intubation at time of first infusion, had a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 60-200 mm Hg, and a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any variant in the past 14 days were eligible for this study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard of care and vilobelimab at a dose of 800 mg intravenously for a maximum of six doses (days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22) or standard of care and a matching placebo using permuted block randomisation. Treatment was not continued after hospital discharge. Participants, caregivers, and assessors were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was defined as all-cause mortality at 28 days in the full analysis set (defined as all randomly assigned participants regardless of whether a patient started treatment, excluding patients randomly assigned in error) and measured using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Safety analyses included all patients who had received at least one infusion of either vilobelimab or placebo. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04333420.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      From Oct 1, 2020, to Oct 4, 2021, we included 368 patients in the ITT analysis (full analysis set; 177 in the vilobelimab group and 191 in the placebo group). One patient in the vilobelimab group was excluded from the primary analysis due to random assignment in error without treatment. At least one dose of study treatment was given to 364 (99%) patients (safety analysis set). 54 patients (31%) of 177 in the vilobelimab group and 77 patients (40%) of 191 in the placebo group died in the first 28 days. The all-cause mortality rate at 28 days was 32% (95% CI 25-39) in the vilobelimab group and 42% (35-49) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·73, 95% CI 0·50-1·06; p=0·094). In the predefined analysis without site-stratification, vilobelimab significantly reduced all-cause mortality at 28 days (HR 0·67, 95% CI 0·48-0·96; p=0·027). The most common TEAEs were acute kidney injury (35 [20%] of 175 in the vilobelimab group vs 40 [21%] of 189 in the placebo), pneumonia (38 [22%] vs 26 [14%]), and septic shock (24 [14%] vs 31 [16%]). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 103 (59%) of 175 patients in the vilobelimab group versus 120 (63%) of 189 in the placebo group.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      In addition to standard of care, vilobelimab improves survival of invasive mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and leads to a significant decrease in mortality. Vilobelimab could be considered as an additional therapy for patients in this setting and further research is needed on the role of vilobelimab and C5a in other acute respiratory distress syndrome-causing viral infections.

Surgical or Transcatheter Aortic-Valve Replacement in Intermediate-Risk Patients.,"Michael J Reardon, Nicolas M Van Mieghem, Jeffrey J Popma, Neal S Kleiman, Lars Søndergaard, Mubashir Mumtaz, David H Adams, G Michael Deeb, Brijeshwar Maini, Hemal Gada, Stanley Chetcuti, Thomas Gleason, John Heiser, Rüdiger Lange, William Merhi, Jae K Oh, Peter S Olsen, Nicolo Piazza, Mathew Williams, Stephan Windecker, Steven J Yakubov, Eberhard Grube, Raj Makkar, Joon S Lee, John Conte, Eric Vang, Hang Nguyen, Yanping Chang, Andrew S Mugglin, Patrick W J C Serruys, Arie P Kappetein                              ;, SURTAVI Investigators, Michael J Reardonet al.",2017 Apr 6,N Engl J Med,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28304219/,No keywords found,"Background:
        
      
      Although transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) is an accepted alternative to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high surgical risk, less is known about comparative outcomes among patients with aortic stenosis who are at intermediate surgical risk.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We evaluated the clinical outcomes in intermediate-risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis in a randomized trial comparing TAVR (performed with the use of a self-expanding prosthesis) with surgical aortic-valve replacement. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or disabling stroke at 24 months in patients undergoing attempted aortic-valve replacement. We used Bayesian analytical methods (with a margin of 0.07) to evaluate the noninferiority of TAVR as compared with surgical valve replacement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1746 patients underwent randomization at 87 centers. Of these patients, 1660 underwent an attempted TAVR or surgical procedure. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 79.8±6.2 years, and all were at intermediate risk for surgery (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality, 4.5±1.6%). At 24 months, the estimated incidence of the primary end point was 12.6% in the TAVR group and 14.0% in the surgery group (95% credible interval [Bayesian analysis] for difference, -5.2 to 2.3%; posterior probability of noninferiority, >0.999). Surgery was associated with higher rates of acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, and transfusion requirements, whereas TAVR had higher rates of residual aortic regurgitation and need for pacemaker implantation. TAVR resulted in lower mean gradients and larger aortic-valve areas than surgery. Structural valve deterioration at 24 months did not occur in either group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      TAVR was a noninferior alternative to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis at intermediate surgical risk, with a different pattern of adverse events associated with each procedure. (Funded by Medtronic; SURTAVI ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01586910 .)."

      Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at increased risk for death from surgery; less is known about TAVR in low-risk patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a randomized noninferiority trial in which TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was compared with surgical aortic-valve replacement in patients who had severe aortic stenosis and were at low surgical risk. When 850 patients had reached 12-month follow-up, we analyzed data regarding the primary end point, a composite of death or disabling stroke at 24 months, using Bayesian methods.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 1468 patients who underwent randomization, an attempted TAVR or surgical procedure was performed in 1403. The patients' mean age was 74 years. The 24-month estimated incidence of the primary end point was 5.3% in the TAVR group and 6.7% in the surgery group (difference, -1.4 percentage points; 95% Bayesian credible interval for difference, -4.9 to 2.1; posterior probability of noninferiority >0.999). At 30 days, patients who had undergone TAVR, as compared with surgery, had a lower incidence of disabling stroke (0.5% vs. 1.7%), bleeding complications (2.4% vs. 7.5%), acute kidney injury (0.9% vs. 2.8%), and atrial fibrillation (7.7% vs. 35.4%) and a higher incidence of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (3.5% vs. 0.5%) and pacemaker implantation (17.4% vs. 6.1%). At 12 months, patients in the TAVR group had lower aortic-valve gradients than those in the surgery group (8.6 mm Hg vs. 11.2 mm Hg) and larger effective orifice areas (2.3 cm2 vs. 2.0 cm2).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with severe aortic stenosis who were at low surgical risk, TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was noninferior to surgery with respect to the composite end point of death or disabling stroke at 24 months.
